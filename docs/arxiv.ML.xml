Abstract: Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains. BatteryLife is available at https://github.com/Ruifeng-Tan/BatteryLife.

<div> interaction, data heterogeneity, federated learning, decision boundary, forgetting<br>
<br>Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity in federated learning and its impact on the global decision boundary. Existing methods often suffer from forgetting, where clients only learn local decision boundaries and forget the global one. Even with pre-trained optimal weights, this issue persists. The proposed FedProj framework aims to robustly learn and retain the global decision boundary during local training. It introduces a server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss for better ensemble knowledge fusion and utilizes an episodic memory of average ensemble logits from a public unlabeled dataset to regulate gradient updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning and retaining the global decision boundary, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of data heterogeneity in federated learning. <div>

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example. Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights, and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion, we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, informational complexity, algorithmic information theory, Binarized Neural Networks, Block Decomposition Method

Summary:
Neural networks' informational complexity is a crucial challenge in machine learning, affecting generalization and optimization. Current approaches often use entropy-based metrics that do not capture underlying algorithmic regularities. This study proposes utilizing algorithmic information theory, specifically with Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), to analyze learning dynamics. By applying the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) based on algorithmic complexity, the study shows that it better reflects structural changes during training than entropy. The BDM has stronger correlations with training loss for various model sizes and training runs, indicating that learning involves algorithmic compression of structured regularities. This work provides a method to estimate learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization based on information theory and computability principles.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.

Reinforcement learning often involves scenarios where the agent only receives partial state information, known as output-feedback settings. To address this challenge, the Output-Feedback Markov Decision Process (OPMDP) is proposed, extending the standard MDP formulation to incorporate decision-making based on observation histories. A new algorithm, Depthwise Attention Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DATD3), is introduced to encode historical observations using depthwise separable convolution and multi-head attention, maintaining policy expressiveness without the instability of recurrent models.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Layer-wise Optimal Task Vector Merging (LOT Merging), a novel technique for consolidating knowledge from multiple fine-tuned task-specific experts into a unified model. LOT Merging aims to minimize feature drift between task-specific experts and the unified model, which is identified as a key factor in performance degradation during model merging. This technique can be formulated as a convex quadratic optimization problem, allowing for efficient model consolidation through basic matrix operations. Experimental results across vision and vision-language benchmarks show that LOT Merging outperforms existing methods, achieving improvements of up to 4.4% over state-of-the-art approaches. LOT Merging provides a promising approach for multi-task model merging without the performance gaps seen in parameter-level methods or the costly secondary training procedures of task-loss approaches. <div>

Abstract: Multi-task model merging aims to consolidate knowledge from multiple fine-tuned task-specific experts into a unified model while minimizing performance degradation. Existing methods primarily approach this by minimizing differences between task-specific experts and the unified model, either from a parameter-level or a task-loss perspective. However, parameter-level methods exhibit a significant performance gap compared to the upper bound, while task-loss approaches entail costly secondary training procedures. In contrast, we observe that performance degradation closely correlates with feature drift, i.e., differences in feature representations of the same sample caused by model merging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Layer-wise Optimal Task Vector Merging (LOT Merging), a technique that explicitly minimizes feature drift between task-specific experts and the unified model in a layer-by-layer manner. LOT Merging can be formulated as a convex quadratic optimization problem, enabling us to analytically derive closed-form solutions for the parameters of linear and normalization layers. Consequently, LOT Merging achieves efficient model consolidation through basic matrix operations. Extensive experiments across vision and vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that LOT Merging significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving improvements of up to 4.4% (ViT-B/32) over state-of-the-art approaches.

Summary: <br />
Drug repositioning aims to find new uses for existing drugs efficiently. Existing deep learning methods struggle with novel drugs in cold-start scenarios. BiBLDR proposes a bidirectional behavior learning strategy by constructing bidirectional behavioral sequences and utilizing a two-stage strategy. The model captures drug-disease interaction patterns more robustly, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming previous methods in cold-start scenarios. The code is available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2505.23861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug repositioning aims to identify potential new indications for existing drugs to reduce the time and financial costs associated with developing new drugs. Most existing deep learning-based drug repositioning methods predominantly utilize graph-based representations. However, graph-based drug repositioning methods struggle to perform effective inference in cold-start scenarios involving novel drugs because of the lack of association information with the diseases. Unlike traditional graph-based approaches, we propose a bidirectional behavior learning strategy for drug repositioning, known as BiBLDR. This innovative framework redefines drug repositioning as a behavior sequential learning task to capture drug-disease interaction patterns. First, we construct bidirectional behavioral sequences based on drug and disease sides. The consideration of bidirectional information ensures a more meticulous and rigorous characterization of the behavioral sequences. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage strategy for drug repositioning. In the first stage, we construct prototype spaces to characterize the representational attributes of drugs and diseases. In the second stage, these refined prototypes and bidirectional behavior sequence data are leveraged to predict potential drug-disease associations. Based on this learning approach, the model can more robustly and precisely capture the interactive relationships between drug and disease features from bidirectional behavioral sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, BiBLDR demonstrates significantly superior performance compared to previous methods in cold-start scenarios. Our code is published in https://github.com/Renyeeah/BiBLDR.

Summary:
PhyxMamba introduces a novel framework for long-term forecasting of chaotic systems using a Mamba-based state-space model and physics-informed principles. By reconstructing attractor manifolds from short-term observations, the framework captures essential dynamical features for accurate forecasting. A generative training scheme allows Mamba to replicate the physical process with multi-token prediction and attractor geometry regularization, ensuring prediction accuracy and maintaining key statistical invariants. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate PhyxMamba's superior forecasting capabilities and ability to capture essential dynamical invariants from limited data. This framework has broad implications in fields such as climate science, neuroscience, and epidemiology, providing a reliable means of predicting chaotic systems under observation-scarce conditions.

Abstract: Long-term forecasting of chaotic systems from short-term observations remains a fundamental and underexplored challenge due to the intrinsic sensitivity to initial conditions and the complex geometry of strange attractors. Existing approaches often rely on long-term training data or focus on short-term sequence correlations, struggling to maintain predictive stability and dynamical coherence over extended horizons. We propose PhyxMamba, a novel framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed principles to capture the underlying dynamics of chaotic systems. By reconstructing the attractor manifold from brief observations using time-delay embeddings, PhyxMamba extracts global dynamical features essential for accurate forecasting. Our generative training scheme enables Mamba to replicate the physical process, augmented by multi-token prediction and attractor geometry regularization for physical constraints, enhancing prediction accuracy and preserving key statistical invariants. Extensive evaluations on diverse simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers superior long-term forecasting and faithfully captures essential dynamical invariants from short-term data. This framework opens new avenues for reliably predicting chaotic systems under observation-scarce conditions, with broad implications across climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, and beyond.

<div> Keywords: Federated learning, graph-structured data, personalized subgraph, auxiliary projections, node embeddings 
Summary: 
FedAux is a novel framework for federated learning on graph-structured data, addressing challenges of non-IID scenarios where clients have distinct subgraphs. It incorporates personalized models through the use of auxiliary projection vectors (APVs) that capture client-specific information without sharing raw data or embeddings. These APVs are trained alongside local graph neural networks (GNNs), enabling inter-client similarities to be computed based on the APVs for knowledge transfer and aggregation of models at the server. The design of FedAux is supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, ensuring convergence and rationality. Empirical evaluations on various graph benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and personalization compared to existing methods. FedAux represents a promising approach for achieving effective federated learning on graph data while maintaining individual client customization. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) on graph-structured data typically faces non-IID challenges, particularly in scenarios where each client holds a distinct subgraph sampled from a global graph. In this paper, we introduce Federated learning with Auxiliary projections (FedAux), a personalized subgraph FL framework that learns to align, compare, and aggregate heterogeneously distributed local models without sharing raw data or node embeddings. In FedAux, each client jointly trains (i) a local GNN and (ii) a learnable auxiliary projection vector (APV) that differentiably projects node embeddings onto a 1D space. A soft-sorting operation followed by a lightweight 1D convolution refines these embeddings in the ordered space, enabling the APV to effectively capture client-specific information. After local training, these APVs serve as compact signatures that the server uses to compute inter-client similarities and perform similarity-weighted parameter mixing, yielding personalized models while preserving cross-client knowledge transfer. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the convergence and rationality of our design. Empirical evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks demonstrate that FedAux substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and personalization performance.

Abstract: Precision agriculture requires efficient autonomous systems for crop monitoring, where agents must explore large-scale environments while minimizing resource consumption. This work addresses the problem as an active exploration task in a grid environment representing an agricultural field. Each cell may contain targets (e.g., damaged crops) observable from nine predefined points of view (POVs). Agents must infer the number of targets per cell using partial, sequential observations.
  We propose a two-stage deep learning framework. A pre-trained LSTM serves as a belief model, updating a probabilistic map of the environment and its associated entropy, which defines the expected information gain (IG). This allows agents to prioritize informative regions. A key contribution is the inclusion of a POV visibility mask in the input, preserving the Markov property under partial observability and avoiding revisits to already explored views.
  Three agent architectures were compared: an untrained IG-based agent selecting actions to maximize entropy reduction; a DQN agent using CNNs over local 3x3 inputs with belief, entropy, and POV mask; and a Double-CNN DQN agent with wider spatial context. Simulations on 20x20 maps showed that the untrained agent performs well despite its simplicity. The DQN agent matches this performance when the POV mask is included, while the Double-CNN agent consistently achieves superior exploration efficiency, especially in larger environments.
  Results show that uncertainty-aware policies leveraging entropy, belief states, and visibility tracking lead to robust and scalable exploration. Future work includes curriculum learning, multi-agent cooperation with shared rewards, transformer-based models, and intrinsic motivation mechanisms to further enhance learning efficiency and policy generalization.

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, calibration, overconfidence, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), CSAM 

Summary: 
Deep neural networks are commonly used in critical applications like medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, but they are often poorly calibrated and tend to be overconfident, leading to potential risks. Traditional training methods like stochastic gradient descent may exacerbate this issue. However, the sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) technique has been shown to mitigate overconfidence by implicitly maximizing the entropy of the predictive distribution. Building on SAM, a new approach called CSAM is proposed to further enhance model calibration. Experimental results on various datasets, including ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM in reducing calibration error. CSAM outperforms SAM and other methods consistently in reducing calibration error, highlighting its potential for improving the reliability of deep neural networks in safety-critical applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been increasingly used in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. However, many studies suggest that they are prone to being poorly calibrated and have a propensity for overconfidence, which may have disastrous consequences. In this paper, unlike standard training such as stochastic gradient descent, we show that the recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) counteracts this tendency towards overconfidence. The theoretical analysis suggests that SAM allows us to learn models that are already well-calibrated by implicitly maximizing the entropy of the predictive distribution. Inspired by this finding, we further propose a variant of SAM, coined as CSAM, to ameliorate model calibration. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the benefits of SAM in reducing calibration error. Meanwhile, CSAM performs even better than SAM and consistently achieves lower calibration error than other approaches

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method, LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks while improving robustness to noisy data. The conventional noise-handling approaches often require laborious data pre-processing or model architecture modifications susceptible to error accumulation. In contrast, LoPE enhances model robustness solely through generated noisy data. By incorporating a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA configuration, LoPE strategically injects noise during fine-tuning to improve noise discrimination and processing. During inference, the dedicated poisoning expert is selectively masked to utilize purified knowledge from normal experts, resulting in noise-robust output. Extensive experiments show that LoPE achieves strong performance without the need for data cleaning, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling noisy data. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection, which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.

Summary: 
MaCP is a new adaptation method that utilizes cosine projection to achieve outstanding performance with minimal parameters and memory requirements for fine-tuning large foundation models. By projecting weight changes from low-rank adaptation into discrete cosine space, MaCP effectively enhances energy compaction and decorrelation properties. The weight change is then segmented across different levels of the discrete cosine spectrum, selecting the most crucial frequency components from each partition. Various experiments across single and multi-modality tasks, including natural language understanding, generation, text summarization, image classification, and video understanding, demonstrate MaCP's superior accuracy, reduced computational complexity, and lower memory demands compared to existing methods. MaCP proves to be a promising approach for enhancing model efficiency and accuracy in various tasks.

Abstract: We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach called Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG) to address data corruption in offline reinforcement learning (RL). It leverages Ambient Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to handle noise in high-dimensional state spaces and multiple corrupted elements simultaneously. The ADG method first uses Ambient DDPM to distinguish between clean and corrupted data and then trains a standard DDPM on the clean subset. This trained standard DDPM is then used to refine the previously identified corrupted data, improving data quality for offline RL training. ADG is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated with any offline RL algorithm, offering strong denoising capabilities and theoretical guarantees. Experiments on various benchmarks show that ADG effectively mitigates the impact of corrupted data and enhances the robustness of offline RL, achieving state-of-the-art results. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Real-world datasets collected from sensors or human inputs are prone to noise and errors, posing significant challenges for applying offline reinforcement learning (RL). While existing methods have made progress in addressing corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second, we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Summary:
RelSC is a new graph-regression dataset created from program graphs, offering a diverse and challenging benchmark for graph regression models. The dataset includes two variants, RelSC-H with rich node features and RelSC-M with multi-relational structures. The labels are execution-time costs of programs, different from existing benchmarks. Various graph neural network architectures are evaluated on both variants, showing consistent performance differences based on the structural representation chosen. This highlights the significance of representation choice in model behavior and indicates the value of RelSC in advancing graph regression methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-level regression underpins many real-world applications, yet public benchmarks remain heavily skewed toward molecular graphs and citation networks. This limited diversity hinders progress on models that must generalize across both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph structures. We introduce RelSC, a new graph-regression dataset built from program graphs that combine syntactic and semantic information extracted from source code. Each graph is labelled with the execution-time cost of the corresponding program, providing a continuous target variable that differs markedly from those found in existing benchmarks. RelSC is released in two complementary variants. RelSC-H supplies rich node features under a single (homogeneous) edge type, while RelSC-M preserves the original multi-relational structure, connecting nodes through multiple edge types that encode distinct semantic relationships. Together, these variants let researchers probe how representation choice influences model behaviour. We evaluate a diverse set of graph neural network architectures on both variants of RelSC. The results reveal consistent performance differences between the homogeneous and multi-relational settings, emphasising the importance of structural representation. These findings demonstrate RelSC's value as a challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing graph regression methods.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, data mixing methods, online data mixing, actor-critic network, pretraining

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces a new method called actor-critic based online data mixing (AC-ODM) to improve the pretraining process of Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging auxiliary actor-critic networks, AC-ODM dynamically adjusts domain weights and considers intra-domain interactions during data mixing. The method transfers the sampling strategy from a small proxy LLM to a larger target LLM, increasing efficiency and accelerating convergence. Numerical results show that AC-ODM-410M, using a proxy LLM with 410M parameters, achieves optimal validation perplexity 71% faster and improves performance on benchmarks like zero-shot MMLU and HumanEval. This approach addresses the limitations of previous data mixing techniques by adapting to training dynamics and optimizing data composition for better generalization in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2505.23878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coverage and composition of pretraining data significantly impacts the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). To reduce the carbon footprint and financial costs of training, some data mixing methods, which applied the optimized domain weights of a small proxy model to train a larger one, were proposed. However, these methods did not evolute with the training dynamics. The existing online data mixing (ODM) method addressed this limitation by applying the multi-armed bandit algorithm as data sampling strategy. Yet, it did not consider the intra-domain interactions. In this paper, we develop an actor-critic based online data mixing (AC-ODM) method, which captures the varying domain weights by auxiliary actor-critic networks and consider the intra-domain interactions with the reward function. While constructing the dataset to pretrain a large target LLM, we directly apply the actor, which is trained with a small proxy LLM as the environment, as the sampling strategy. The transfer of sampling strategy can not only ensure the efficiency of dynamical data mixing, but also expedite the convergence of pretraining the target LLM. Numerical results demonstrate that AC-ODM-410M, which invokes the sampling strategy obtained by a proxy LLM with 410M parameters, reaching the optimal validation perplexity of ODM 71% faster, and improves performance on the zero-shot MMLU benchmark by 27.5% of accuracy, about 2.23x better on pass@1 of HumanEval benchmark.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the critical need for accurate prediction of disease severity to optimize healthcare resource allocation and patient management. The spike protein, which facilitates viral entry into host cells, exhibits high mutation rates, particularly in the receptor-binding domain, influencing viral pathogenicity. Artificial intelligence approaches, such as deep learning, offer promising solutions for leveraging genomic and clinical data to predict disease outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to develop a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model to predict COVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and associated clinical metadata from South American patients. Methods: We retrieved 9,570 spike protein sequences from the GISAID database, of which 3,467 met inclusion criteria after standardization. The dataset included 2,313 severe and 1,154 mild cases. A feature engineering pipeline extracted features from sequences, while demographic and clinical variables were one-hot encoded. A hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture was trained, combining CNN layers for local pattern extraction and an LSTM layer for long-term dependency modeling. Results: The model achieved an F1 score of 82.92%, ROC-AUC of 0.9084, precision of 83.56%, and recall of 82.85%, demonstrating robust classification performance. Training stabilized at 85% accuracy with minimal overfitting. The most prevalent lineages (P.1, AY.99.2) and clades (GR, GK) aligned with regional epidemiological trends, suggesting potential associations between viral genetics and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM hybrid model effectively predicted COVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and clinical data, highlighting the utility of AI in genomic surveillance and precision public health. Despite limitations, this approach provides a framework for early severity prediction in future outbreaks.

<div> Large Chunk Test-Time Training, Context dependencies, Fast weights, State capacity, Scaling, 

Summary:
The paper introduces a new approach called Large Chunk Test-Time Training (LaCT) to handle context dependencies in deep learning models. LaCT adapts part of the model's weights (fast weights) during inference, similar to recurrent states in RNNs, but with larger chunk sizes ranging from 2K to 1M tokens. This approach significantly improves hardware utilization and allows for scaling of nonlinear state sizes without requiring complex kernel implementations. By using large chunk updates, LaCT enhances state capacity and enables efficient handling of long-context data in various tasks such as language models, auto-regressive video diffusion, and novel view synthesis. The method showcases successful experiments on tasks with sequences ranging up to 56K tokens, including novel view synthesis with a context length of 1 million. LaCT opens new possibilities for long-context modeling and test-time training in deep learning research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) models context dependencies by adapting part of the model's weights (referred to as fast weights) during inference. This fast weight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past tokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show effectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on modern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely low FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online minibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover, a small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the data, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or N-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the opposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to 1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk Test-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size (up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity, all without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It also allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online updates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks, including novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and auto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR video diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence experiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length. We hope this work will inspire and accelerate new research in the field of long-context modeling and test-time training. Website: https://tianyuanzhang.com/projects/ttt-done-right

<div> surrogate model, acquisition function, Bayesian optimization, deep generative model, efficiency<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This article presents a new approach to optimizing expensive black-box functions using Bayesian optimization (BO). The traditional BO process involves fitting a surrogate model and optimizing an acquisition function at each iteration. However, this study proposes a zero-shot solution that eliminates the need for surrogate fitting or acquisition function optimization. By using a pre-trained deep generative model to sample from the posterior over the optimum point, equivalent to Thompson sampling, this approach achieves significant efficiency gains. The method outperforms Gaussian process-based BO, offering a more cost-effective and time-efficient solution for high-throughput optimization tasks. This innovative approach enables efficient parallel and distributed BO, making it a promising advancement in the field of optimization. <div>
arXiv:2505.23913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of expensive black-box functions is ubiquitous in science and engineering. A common solution to this problem is Bayesian optimization (BO), which is generally comprised of two components: (i) a surrogate model and (ii) an acquisition function, which generally require expensive re-training and optimization steps at each iteration, respectively. Although recent work enabled in-context surrogate models that do not require re-training, virtually all existing BO methods still require acquisition function maximization to select the next observation, which introduces many knobs to tune, such as Monte Carlo samplers and multi-start optimizers. In this work, we propose a completely in-context, zero-shot solution for BO that does not require surrogate fitting or acquisition function optimization. This is done by using a pre-trained deep generative model to directly sample from the posterior over the optimum point. We show that this process is equivalent to Thompson sampling and demonstrate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of our foundation model on a suite of real-world benchmarks. We achieve an efficiency gain of more than 35x in terms of wall-clock time when compared with Gaussian process-based BO, enabling efficient parallel and distributed BO, e.g., for high-throughput optimization.

arXiv:2505.23927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has achieved great empirical success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference, and it is of great importance to study the statistical efficiency of RLHF algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we consider the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the $log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound, which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may be of independent interest.

Summary:
BIRD (Behavior Induction via Representation-structure Distillation) is a framework designed to transfer human-aligned behavioral properties, such as robustness, fairness, and honesty, from a teacher model to a student model. This framework aims to address the challenge of forgetting aligned behavior during fine-tuning and the high cost of collecting task-specific data. BIRD has shown improved performance in out-of-distribution robustness in image classification, outperforming traditional methods like fine-tuning and transfer learning. It is effective even when the teacher model is simpler and significantly smaller than the student model. By analyzing the teacher's internal representation structure, BIRD can identify key properties that contribute to successful transfer of aligned behavior, offering practical guidance for teacher selection and design. This framework transforms small, well-aligned models into scalable alignment seeds, removing a bottleneck in deploying safe AI systems in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human-aligned deep learning models exhibit behaviors consistent with human values, such as robustness, fairness, and honesty. Transferring these behavioral properties to models trained on different tasks or data distributions remains challenging: aligned behavior is easily forgotten during fine-tuning, and collecting task-specific data that preserves this behavior can be prohibitively costly. We introduce BIRD (Behavior Induction via Representation-structure Distillation), a flexible framework for transferring aligned behavior by matching the internal representation structure of a student model to that of a teacher. Applied to out-of-distribution robustness in image classification, BIRD outperforms fine-tuning, transfer learning, and continual learning methods, improving robust accuracy by up to 16% over the next strongest baseline. It remains effective even when the teacher is trained on a much simpler dataset and is $25 \times$ smaller than the student. In a large-scale study of over 400 teacher-student pairs, we show that three interpretable and computable properties of the teacher's representations (i.e., task relevance, behavioral relevance, and complementary knowledge) explain up to 85% of the variance in transfer success. These insights offer practical guidance for teacher selection and design. BIRD turns small, well-aligned models into scalable alignment seeds, removing a key bottleneck in deploying safe AI systems in the wild.

Summary:
State-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs) are found to be strongly biased, impacting their accuracy on visual tasks such as counting and identification. These biases are evident across various domains including animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, and patterned grids. Even when instructed to double-check results or rely solely on image details, VLMs only show a slight improvement in counting accuracy. The study showcases how prior knowledge encoded in large language models can lead to inaccurate responses in visual tasks. An automated framework for testing biases in VLMs is introduced, highlighting the need to address and mitigate these biases for better model performance. The research sheds light on a significant failure mode in VLMs and emphasizes the importance of assessing and rectifying biases in model development. <div>
arXiv:2505.23941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from the Internet that help them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code and data are available at: vlmsarebiased.github.io.

Abstract: The design of activation functions remains a pivotal component in optimizing deep neural networks. While prevailing choices like Swish and GELU demonstrate considerable efficacy, they often exhibit domain-specific optima. This work introduces SG-Blend, a novel activation function that blends our proposed SSwish, a first-order symmetric variant of Swish and the established GELU through dynamic interpolation. By adaptively blending these constituent functions via learnable parameters, SG-Blend aims to harness their complementary strengths: SSwish's controlled non-monotonicity and symmetry, and GELU's smooth, probabilistic profile, to achieve a more universally robust balance between model expressivity and gradient stability. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse modalities and architectures, showing performance improvements across all considered natural language and computer vision tasks and models. These results, achieved with negligible computational overhead, underscore SG-Blend's potential as a versatile, drop-in replacement that consistently outperforms strong contemporary baselines.

Summary: 
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) are neural network methods trained on artificial datasets to capture prior distributions. They offer efficient pre-training in low-data scenarios and are increasingly used in complex domains. PFNs and amortized inference are seen as the future of Bayesian inference due to their ability to tackle data-scarce problems. The paper argues for the importance of PFNs in research and explores their potential and limitations. With computational resources expanding and real-world data generation stagnant, PFNs are highlighted as a crucial tool in various applications. The field has evolved from small tasks to handling larger datasets, indicating their versatility and relevance in modern Bayesian modeling.

Abstract: Training neural networks on randomly generated artificial datasets yields Bayesian models that capture the prior defined by the dataset-generating distribution. Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) are a class of methods designed to leverage this insight. In an era of rapidly increasing computational resources for pre-training and a near stagnation in the generation of new real-world data in many applications, PFNs are poised to play a more important role across a wide range of applications. They enable the efficient allocation of pre-training compute to low-data scenarios. Originally applied to small Bayesian modeling tasks, the field of PFNs has significantly expanded to address more complex domains and larger datasets. This position paper argues that PFNs and other amortized inference approaches represent the future of Bayesian inference, leveraging amortized learning to tackle data-scarce problems. We thus believe they are a fruitful area of research. In this position paper, we explore their potential and directions to address their current limitations.

<div> Pruning, Neural Networks, N:M Sparsity, Transposable Masks, Efficient Solver <br />
<br />
Summary: Network pruning reduces computational requirements in neural networks by utilizing N:M sparsity. However, this sparsity pattern does not efficiently accelerate both forward and backward passes during training. A new method is introduced to efficiently generate transposable N:M sparse masks that scale to large models. The approach formulates mask generation as optimal transport problems, utilizing entropy regularization and Dykstra's algorithm, followed by a rounding procedure. Implementing this approach using tensors leverages GPU parallelism, achieving significant speedup with minimal error compared to existing methods. The generated transposable masks can be integrated with various pruning frameworks to produce models with arbitrary N:M values. Experimental results show that models with transposable 16:32 sparsity maintain performance close to their standard N:M counterparts and outperform standard 2:4 sparse models, demonstrating the practical value of the proposed approach. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.23949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network pruning reduces the computational requirements of large neural networks, with N:M sparsity -- retaining only N out of every M consecutive weights -- offering a compelling balance between compressed model quality and hardware acceleration. However, N:M sparsity only accelerates forward-pass computations, as N:M patterns are not preserved during matrix transposition, limiting efficiency during training where both passes are computationally intensive. While transposable N:M sparsity has been proposed to address this limitation, existing methods for finding transposable N:M sparse masks either fail to scale to large models or are restricted to M=4 which results in suboptimal compression-accuracy trade-off. We introduce an efficient solver for transposable N:M masks that scales to billion-parameter models. We formulate mask generation as optimal transport problems and solve through entropy regularization and Dykstra's algorithm, followed by a rounding procedure. Our tensor-based implementation exploits GPU parallelism, achieving up to 100x speedup with only 1-10% error compared to existing methods. Our approach can be integrated with layer-wise N:M pruning frameworks including Wanda, SparseGPT and ALPS to produce transposable N:M sparse models with arbitrary N:M values. Experiments show that LLaMA3.2-8B with transposable 16:32 sparsity maintains performance close to its standard N:M counterpart and outperforms standard 2:4 sparse model, showing the practical value of our approach.

<div> allocation, resources, ML models, misreporting, causally-motivated

Summary:
- ML models are used for resource allocation, where affected agents may strategically modify their features.
- Distinguishing between deceptive changes and genuine modifications is challenging.
- A causally-motivated approach is proposed to identify and quantify misreporting by analyzing causal effects.
- Misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables, allowing for the detection of deception.
- The approach is validated using semi-synthetic and real Medicare datasets, proving its effectiveness in identifying misreporting in real-world scenarios.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In settings where ML models are used to inform the allocation of resources, agents affected by the allocation decisions might have an incentive to strategically change their features to secure better outcomes. While prior work has studied strategic responses broadly, disentangling misreporting from genuine modification remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose a causally-motivated approach to identify and quantify how much an agent misreports on average by distinguishing deceptive changes in their features from genuine modification. Our key insight is that, unlike genuine modification, misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables (i.e., causal descendants). We exploit this asymmetry by comparing the causal effect of misreported features on their causal descendants as derived from manipulated datasets against those from unmanipulated datasets. We formally prove identifiability of the misreporting rate and characterize the variance of our estimator. We empirically validate our theoretical results using a semi-synthetic and real Medicare dataset with misreported data, demonstrating that our approach can be employed to identify misreporting in real-world scenarios.

Summary: This thesis introduces quantitative methods to analyze representational spaces in large-scale neural networks. It identifies structural primitives and information theoretic quantifications to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information and what structures drive generalization. The research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning models, sequence-to-sequence models, and Large Language Models, shedding light on how large-scale distributed models of cognition learn. The experiments demonstrate parallels between the structures of language and those driving contemporary neural networks' performance. Additionally, a novel approach to estimating vector space entropy is introduced, allowing for analysis across models of varying parameter sizes from one million to 12 billion. This analysis aims to enhance our understanding of how neural networks learn and their similarities to human cognitive systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large large-scale neural networks, we still lack unified notation for thinking about and describing their representational spaces. We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are structured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of structures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for identifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages them to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information, what representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions condition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural primitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic quantifications of each. These allow us to analyse learning, structure, and generalisation across multi-agent reinforcement learning models, sequence-to-sequence models trained on a single task, and Large Language Models. I also introduce a novel, performant, approach to estimating the entropy of vector space, that allows this analysis to be applied to models ranging in size from 1 million to 12 billion parameters.
  The experiments here work to shed light on how large-scale distributed models of cognition learn, while allowing us to draw parallels between those systems and their human analogs. They show how the structures of language and the constraints that give rise to them in many ways parallel the kinds of structures that drive performance of contemporary neural networks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces improved approximation algorithms for NP-hard graph problems by incorporating predictions based on past data. Building upon the $\varepsilon$-prediction framework, the edge-based model uses two bits of information per edge to make predictions about optimal solutions. Even with weak correlations, these predictions help break approximation barriers in MaxCut, Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Maximum Independent Set problems. The algorithms developed improve approximation ratios by satisfying constraints related to high degree vertices using predictions and low-degree vertices without predictions, and combining the results effectively. <div>
arXiv:2505.23967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design improved approximation algorithms for NP-hard graph problems by incorporating predictions (e.g., learned from past data). Our prediction model builds upon and extends the $\varepsilon$-prediction framework by Cohen-Addad, d'Orsi, Gupta, Lee, and Panigrahi (NeurIPS 2024). We consider an edge-based version of this model, where each edge provides two bits of information, corresponding to predictions about whether each of its endpoints belong to an optimal solution. Even with weak predictions where each bit is only $\varepsilon$-correlated with the true solution, this information allows us to break approximation barriers in the standard setting. We develop algorithms with improved approximation ratios for MaxCut, Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Maximum Independent Set problems (among others). Across these problems, our algorithms share a unifying theme, where we separately satisfy constraints related to high degree vertices (using predictions) and low-degree vertices (without using predictions) and carefully combine the answers.

<title>Critical Batch Size Revisited: A Simple Empirical Approach to Large-Batch Language Model Training</title>

<div> keywords: batch size, language models, training, gradient noise, CBS <br />
Summary: 
The paper discusses the importance of determining the right batch size for training language models at scale. McCandlish et al. proposed a method to estimate the critical batch size (CBS) based on gradient noise scale, but this method has limitations. The authors introduce an empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and observe how it evolves during training. They find that the CBS starts near 0, increases rapidly initially, then plateaus as training progresses. This trend is consistent across different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting that insights from smaller training runs can inform larger-scale training runs. The study advocates for batch size warmup as a method to train language models reliably at large batch sizes. By implementing batch size warmup, they successfully train a model to achieve better loss with fewer gradient steps. This approach demonstrates the potential to enhance data parallelism without sacrificing performance. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The right batch size is important when training language models at scale: a large batch size is necessary for fast training, but a batch size that is too large will harm token efficiency. To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al. (2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising performance.

<div> Framework, Federated Learning, Optimization, Convergence Analysis, Heterogeneous Conditions
Summary:
ADEL-FL introduces a novel framework for Federated Learning that optimally adjusts per-round deadlines and user-specific batch sizes. By jointly optimizing these parameters, the approach minimizes latency bottlenecks caused by slower devices (stragglers) in synchronous FL settings. A constrained optimization problem is formulated to minimize the expected L2 distance to the global optimum under total training time and global rounds. Convergence analysis under exponential compute models shows that ADEL-FL provides unbiased updates with bounded variance. Extensive experiments demonstrate ADEL-FL's superior performance in convergence rate and final accuracy compared to alternative methods in the presence of device heterogeneity. The approach effectively addresses the challenges posed by strict time constraints in Federated Learning settings, offering a promising solution for collaborative model training across distributed edge devices while preserving data privacy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed edge devices while preserving data privacy, and typically operates in a round-based synchronous manner. However, synchronous FL suffers from latency bottlenecks due to device heterogeneity, where slower clients (stragglers) delay or degrade global updates. Prior solutions, such as fixed deadlines, client selection, and layer-wise partial aggregation, alleviate the effect of stragglers, but treat round timing and local workload as static parameters, limiting their effectiveness under strict time constraints. We propose ADEL-FL, a novel framework that jointly optimizes per-round deadlines and user-specific batch sizes for layer-wise aggregation. Our approach formulates a constrained optimization problem minimizing the expected L2 distance to the global optimum under total training time and global rounds. We provide a convergence analysis under exponential compute models and prove that ADEL-FL yields unbiased updates with bounded variance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADEL-FL outperforms alternative methods in both convergence rate and final accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.

Abstract: In real-world drug design, molecule optimization requires selectively improving multiple molecular properties up to pharmaceutically relevant levels, while maintaining others that already meet such criteria. However, existing computational approaches and instruction-tuned LLMs fail to capture such nuanced property-specific objectives, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce C-MuMOInstruct, the first instruction-tuning dataset focused on multi-property optimization with explicit, property-specific objectives. Leveraging C-MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMO-Cs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs that can perform targeted property-specific optimization. Our experiments across 5 in-distribution and 5 out-of-distribution tasks show that GeLLMO-Cs consistently outperform strong baselines, achieving up to 126% higher success rate. Notably, GeLLMO-Cs exhibit impressive 0-shot generalization to novel optimization tasks and unseen instructions. This offers a step toward a foundational LLM to support realistic, diverse optimizations with property-specific objectives.

Summary:
DMMV introduces a novel approach to enhance long-term time series forecasting by leveraging multi-modal views of numerical sequences in the form of images and texts. By integrating trend-seasonal decomposition and a unique backcast residual method, DMMV outperforms existing models in predicting future trends across diverse datasets. The use of large vision models (LVMs) for forecasting introduces a bias towards forecasting periods, which DMMV addresses effectively. Comparative evaluations show that DMMV achieves the best mean squared error on the majority of benchmark datasets, highlighting its superior performance in long-term time series forecasting. This innovative framework presents a promising direction for utilizing multi-modal views to improve forecasting accuracy. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models (LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified in this work, applying LVMs to LTSF poses an inductive bias towards "forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal decomposition and a novel backcast residual based adaptive decomposition to integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE) on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets.

<div> Keywords: hyperparameter tuning, machine learning systems, deep neural networks, optimization methods, learning-rate-free methods 

Summary: 
Despite advances in methodology, hyperparameter tuning remains crucial for machine learning system development. Deep neural networks have numerous optimization and regularization hyperparameters requiring careful tuning per workload. The ideal scenario would involve training algorithms with default settings that perform well across various workloads without the need for workload-specific tuning. Recent research focuses on reducing hyperparameters, particularly the learning rate and its schedule. This paper evaluates the potential of learning-rate-free methods as components of hyperparameter-free methods. Testing against the AlgoPerf benchmark revealed that default settings performed poorly, necessitating a search for configurations that achieved high performance across all workloads simultaneously. While the best learning-rate-free methods showed improved performance, they still slightly lagged behind a NadamW baseline. This study highlights the need for further enhancement of learning-rate-free methods and underscores the importance of benchmarking against strong, workload-agnostic baselines. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.24005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite major advances in methodology, hyperparameter tuning remains a crucial (and expensive) part of the development of machine learning systems. Even ignoring architectural choices, deep neural networks have a large number of optimization and regularization hyperparameters that need to be tuned carefully per workload in order to obtain the best results. In a perfect world, training algorithms would not require workload-specific hyperparameter tuning, but would instead have default settings that performed well across many workloads. Recently, there has been a growing literature on optimization methods which attempt to reduce the number of hyperparameters -- particularly the learning rate and its accompanying schedule. Given these developments, how far away is the dream of neural network training algorithms that completely obviate the need for painful tuning?
  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of learning-rate-free methods as components of hyperparameter-free methods. We freeze their (non-learning rate) hyperparameters to default values, and score their performance using the recently-proposed AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. We found that literature-supplied default settings performed poorly on the benchmark, so we performed a search for hyperparameter configurations that performed well across all workloads simultaneously. The best AlgoPerf-calibrated learning-rate-free methods had much improved performance but still lagged slightly behind a similarly calibrated NadamW baseline in overall benchmark score. Our results suggest that there is still much room for improvement for learning-rate-free methods, and that testing against a strong, workload-agnostic baseline is important to improve hyperparameter reduction techniques.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper explores the implicit bias of Adam, a popular optimization algorithm in deep learning, compared to standard first-order methods like gradient descent (GD). While neural networks trained with SGD tend to favor simple solutions, Adam is shown to be more resistant to simplicity bias. By analyzing the biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer ReLU neural networks, the study reveals that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, leading to suboptimal linear decision boundaries, while Adam creates richer, nonlinear boundaries closer to optimal solutions. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that Adam's diversity in features leads to higher test accuracy and better generalization across datasets with spurious correlations, where networks trained with SGD struggle. <div>
arXiv:2505.24022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adam is the de facto optimization algorithm for several deep learning applications, but an understanding of its implicit bias and how it differs from other algorithms, particularly standard first-order methods such as (stochastic) gradient descent (GD), remains limited. In practice, neural networks trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to find simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such simplicity bias. To demystify this phenomenon, in this paper, we investigate the differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer ReLU neural networks on a binary classification task involving synthetic data with Gaussian clusters. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting in a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to much richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is closer to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also allows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under certain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing the population gradients. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we present empirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior generalization across datasets with spurious correlations where neural networks trained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and don't generalize well under certain distributional shifts.

<br />Summary:
The study investigates the utility of Large Vision Models (LVMs) in time series analysis, comparing their performance on classification and forecasting tasks using various datasets and baselines. The findings suggest that LVMs are effective for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. While some LVMs show promise as forecasters, they are limited in their ability to utilize long look-back windows and exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods. The study highlights the need for further research to enhance LVMs and explore multimodal solutions for diverse time series tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.24030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality, Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past, the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based solutions to different time series tasks.

arXiv:2505.24034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the most effective post-training approach for improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, because of the high demands on latency and memory, it is particularly challenging to develop an efficient RL framework that reliably manages policy models with hundreds to thousands of billions of parameters.
  In this paper, we present LlamaRL, a fully distributed, asynchronous RL framework optimized for efficient training of large-scale LLMs with various model sizes (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) on GPU clusters ranging from a handful to thousands of devices. LlamaRL introduces a streamlined, single-controller architecture built entirely on native PyTorch, enabling modularity, ease of use, and seamless scalability to thousands of GPUs. We also provide a theoretical analysis of LlamaRL's efficiency, including a formal proof that its asynchronous design leads to strict RL speed-up. Empirically, by leveraging best practices such as colocated model offloading, asynchronous off-policy training, and distributed direct memory access for weight synchronization, LlamaRL achieves significant efficiency gains -- up to 10.7x speed-up compared to DeepSpeed-Chat-like systems on a 405B-parameter policy model. Furthermore, the efficiency advantage continues to grow with increasing model scale, demonstrating the framework's suitability for future large-scale RL training.

Summary:<br />
Deep neural networks often exhibit spurious bias, leading to reliance on non-essential features for predictions. Existing methods to mitigate this bias require external annotations, which may not be practical. NeuronTune is a post hoc method that intervenes in a model's decision process to regulate neurons causing spurious behaviors, without needing correlation annotations. Theoretical justification and experiments across various architectures and data modalities show that NeuronTune effectively reduces spurious bias in a self-guided manner, improving model robustness. <div>
arXiv:2505.24048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often develop spurious bias, reliance on correlations between non-essential features and classes for predictions. For example, a model may identify objects based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than intrinsic features, resulting in degraded performance on data lacking these correlations. Existing mitigation approaches typically depend on external annotations of spurious correlations, which may be difficult to obtain and are not relevant to the spurious bias in a model. In this paper, we take a step towards self-guided mitigation of spurious bias by proposing NeuronTune, a post hoc method that directly intervenes in a model's internal decision process. Our method probes in a model's latent embedding space to identify and regulate neurons that lead to spurious prediction behaviors. We theoretically justify our approach and show that it brings the model closer to an unbiased one. Unlike previous methods, NeuronTune operates without requiring spurious correlation annotations, making it a practical and effective tool for improving model robustness. Experiments across different architectures and data modalities demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates spurious bias in a self-guided way.

<div> Keywords: Transformers, Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention, noise resilience, contrast enhancement, lateral inhibition

Summary: 
The study introduces Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) as a solution to address the vulnerability of Transformers to corrupted inputs. Inspired by biological neural circuits, M-DGSA incorporates an input-dependent gating mechanism grounded in lateral inhibition. The model includes excitatory and inhibitory branches per head that dynamically suppress attention noise. By fusing dual softmax maps with a sigmoid gate predicted from token embeddings, M-DGSA achieves context-aware contrast enhancement. This innovative approach seamlessly integrates into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results on vision and language benchmarks showcase the superior robustness of M-DGSA compared to vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. The study contributes a novel method for noise resilience in self-attention, combining principles of contrast enhancement and self-attention theory, backed by comprehensive cross-domain experiments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.24054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers excel across a large variety of tasks but remain susceptible to corrupted inputs, since standard self-attention treats all query-key interactions uniformly. Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii) comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain applicability.

<div> Graph neural networks, unsupervised domain adaptation, link prediction, message-passing mechanism, identity-preserving learning<br />
<br />Summary:
This paper introduces a novel framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in graph neural networks. It addresses the challenge of domain shift by leveraging link prediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs. This facilitates message-passing between the graphs and ensures that target nodes have "in-distribution" neighborhoods with the source domain. The framework modifies the target graph on the input level to reduce deviation from the source domain in the embedding space. It also includes an identity-preserving learning objective to prevent the loss of discriminative information in the target graph. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability for node classification on graphs. However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while obtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly emerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a classifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target graph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been proposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target graphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply adopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically distributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do not fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs during the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among domains. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that adopts link prediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs, which can facilitate message-passing between the source and target graphs and augment the target nodes to have ``in-distribution'' neighborhoods with the source domain. This strategy modified the target graph on the input level to reduce its deviation from the source domain in the embedding space and is insensitive to disproportional label distributions across domains. To prevent the loss of discriminative information in the target graph, we further design a novel identity-preserving learning objective, which guides the learning of the edge insertion module together with reconstruction and adaptation losses. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Summary:  
- Study developed models for phoneme recognition using single-speaker MRI data, aiming to understand the relationship between acoustics and articulation in speech.  
- Unimodal audio and video models as well as multimodal models were compared, showing similar performance in phonetic manner classes but differences in places of articulation.  
- Latent space analysis revealed similar encoding of phonetic space across audio and multimodal models.  
- Attention weights of the models highlighted differences in acoustic and articulatory timing for certain phonemes.  
- Previous multi-speaker corpus studies were limited in understanding detailed relationships between acoustics and articulation due to cross-speaker variability, emphasizing the importance of single-speaker data in multimodal learning research.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.24059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although many previous studies have carried out multimodal learning with real-time MRI data that captures the audio-visual kinematics of the vocal tract during speech, these studies have been limited by their reliance on multi-speaker corpora. This prevents such models from learning a detailed relationship between acoustics and articulation due to considerable cross-speaker variability. In this study, we develop unimodal audio and video models as well as multimodal models for phoneme recognition using a long-form single-speaker MRI corpus, with the goal of disentangling and interpreting the contributions of each modality. Audio and multimodal models show similar performance on different phonetic manner classes but diverge on places of articulation. Interpretation of the models' latent space shows similar encoding of the phonetic space across audio and multimodal models, while the models' attention weights highlight differences in acoustic and articulatory timing for certain phonemes.

Summary: This article explores the ability of deep neural networks to generalize well across various tasks despite being heavily overparameterized. By studying the training dynamics of depth-2 discrete fully connected networks on Boolean functions, the authors establish a connection between the network's inductive prior, training dynamics, feature learning, and eventual generalization. Through a Monte Carlo learning algorithm, predictable training dynamics and interpretable features emerge, shedding light on how inductive bias and feature formation drive generalization. This end-to-end case study offers insights into the mechanisms underlying deep neural network generalization and highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between inductive priors, training dynamics, and feature learning in achieving robust generalization performance. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are renowned for their ability to generalise well across diverse tasks, even when heavily overparameterized. Existing works offer only partial explanations (for example, the NTK-based task-model alignment explanation neglects feature learning). Here, we provide an end-to-end, analytically tractable case study that links a network's inductive prior, its training dynamics including feature learning, and its eventual generalisation. Specifically, we exploit the one-to-one correspondence between depth-2 discrete fully connected networks and disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas by training on Boolean functions. Under a Monte Carlo learning algorithm, our model exhibits predictable training dynamics and the emergence of interpretable features. This framework allows us to trace, in detail, how inductive bias and feature formation drive generalisation.

Summary: <br />
1. Deep reinforcement learning agents often experience neuronal activity loss hindering their ability to adapt and learn continuously. <br />
2. The traditional method to address this issue, tau-dormant neuron ratio, lacks effectiveness in complex architectures. <br />
3. Maintaining a neuron's learning capacity is crucial for advanced RL agents, leading to the introduction of GraMa, a metric focusing on gradient-based adaptability. <br />
4. GraMa successfully identifies inactive neurons in diverse architectures and facilitates improved learning through ReGraMa, a reset process guided by GraMa. <br />
5. The application of ReGraMa enhances learning performance across various deep RL algorithms and benchmarks, including MuJoCo and the DeepMind Control Suite. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently suffer from neuronal activity loss, which impairs their ability to adapt to new data and learn continually. A common method to quantify and address this issue is the tau-dormant neuron ratio, which uses activation statistics to measure the expressive ability of neurons. While effective for simple MLP-based agents, this approach loses statistical power in more complex architectures. To address this, we argue that in advanced RL agents, maintaining a neuron's learning capacity, its ability to adapt via gradient updates, is more critical than preserving its expressive ability. Based on this insight, we shift the statistical objective from activations to gradients, and introduce GraMa (Gradient Magnitude Neural Activity Metric), a lightweight, architecture-agnostic metric for quantifying neuron-level learning capacity. We show that GraMa effectively reveals persistent neuron inactivity across diverse architectures, including residual networks, diffusion models, and agents with varied activation functions. Moreover, resetting neurons guided by GraMa (ReGraMa) consistently improves learning performance across multiple deep RL algorithms and benchmarks, such as MuJoCo and the DeepMind Control Suite.

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) trains neural networks to simulate classical algorithms, enabling structured and interpretable reasoning over complex data. While prior research has predominantly focused on learning exact algorithms for polynomial-time-solvable problems, extending NAR to harder problems remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a general NAR framework grounded in the primal-dual paradigm, a classical method for designing efficient approximation algorithms. By leveraging a bipartite representation between primal and dual variables, we establish an alignment between primal-dual algorithms and Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, we incorporate optimal solutions from small instances to greatly enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Our empirical results demonstrate that our model not only simulates but also outperforms approximation algorithms for multiple tasks, exhibiting robust generalization to larger and out-of-distribution graphs. Moreover, we highlight the framework's practical utility by integrating it with commercial solvers and applying it to real-world datasets.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in real-world tasks that require data manipulation. A new benchmark called DSR-Bench has been introduced to evaluate LLMs' structural reasoning abilities through data structures, providing interpretable representations of data relationships. This benchmark includes various data structures, operations, and problem instances for detailed analysis. The evaluation process is automated and deterministic, ensuring objectivity and scalability. Results show that instruction-tuned models struggle with basic reasoning tasks, while reasoning-oriented models perform better but still face challenges with complex structures. Models often struggle with multi-dimensional data and natural language tasks, indicating a gap for real-world applications. These findings highlight the need for further improvement in LLMs' reasoning capabilities for practical deployment.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.24069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for real-world tasks that fundamentally involve data manipulation. A core requirement across these tasks is the ability to perform structural reasoning--that is, to understand and reason about data relationships. For example, customer requests require a temporal ordering, which can be represented by data structures such as queues. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-level, application-driven evaluations without isolating this fundamental capability. To address this gap, we introduce DSR-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLMs' structural reasoning capabilities through data structures, which provide interpretable representations of data relationships. DSR-Bench includes 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 problem instances, organized hierarchically for fine-grained analysis of reasoning limitations. Our evaluation pipeline is fully automated and deterministic, eliminating subjective human or model-based judgments. Its synthetic nature also ensures scalability and minimizes data contamination risks. We benchmark nine state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that instruction-tuned models struggle with basic multi-attribute and multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, while reasoning-oriented models perform better, they remain fragile on complex and hybrid structures, with the best model achieving an average score of only 47% on the challenge subset. Crucially, models often perform poorly on multi-dimensional data and natural language task descriptions, highlighting a critical gap for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia associated with elevated health risks, where timely detection is pivotal for mitigating stroke-related morbidity. This study introduces an innovative hybrid methodology integrating unsupervised deep learning and gradient boosting models to improve AF detection. A 19-layer deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is coupled with three boosting classifiers-AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM (LGBM)-to harness their complementary advantages while addressing individual limitations. The proposed framework uniquely combines DCAE with gradient boosting, enabling end-to-end AF identification devoid of manual feature extraction. The DCAE-LGBM model attains an F1-score of 95.20%, sensitivity of 99.99%, and inference latency of four seconds, outperforming existing methods and aligning with clinical deployment requirements. The DCAE integration significantly enhances boosting models, positioning this hybrid system as a reliable tool for automated AF detection in clinical settings.

Summary: <br />
Proxy-FDA is a novel regularization method that aims to mitigate concept forgetting during fine-tuning of vision foundation models. It preserves structural knowledge in feature space through Feature Distribution Alignment using nearest neighbor graphs. By incorporating informative proxies to increase data diversity, Proxy-FDA significantly reduces forgetting and aligns feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. The method demonstrates benefits across various fine-tuning settings and tasks like image classification, captioning, and VQA. A strong correlation between forgetting and distributional distance metrics is observed, highlighting the effectiveness of Proxy-FDA in maintaining knowledge while adapting models to new tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.24088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often leads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose a novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end, few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image classification, captioning and VQA.

By leveraging the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework, the researchers derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for node-level MIAs against graph neural networks. They introduce BASE and G-BASE, efficient approximations of the Bayes-optimal attack, with G-BASE demonstrating superior performance compared to existing classifier-based attacks. BASE, applicable to non-graph data as well, achieves performance on par or better than prior state-of-the-art MIAs like LiRA and RMIA at a lower computational cost. The study also establishes the equivalence between BASE and RMIA under a specific hyperparameter setting, offering a principled, Bayes-optimal rationale for the RMIA attack. <div>

Abstract: We develop practical and theoretically grounded membership inference attacks (MIAs) against both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and graph-structured data. Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and G-BASE, computationally efficient approximations of the Bayes-optimal attack. G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for the RMIA attack.

Summary: 
An interpretable multi-level stacking ensemble model was developed to predict length of stay (LOS) in acute stroke patients, using data from the Stroke Foundation Acute Audit in Australia. The model, developed separately for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, outperformed logistic regression in predicting prolonged LOS in ischaemic stroke but not in haemorrhagic stroke. Candidate predictors were categorized into patient, clinical, and system domains, with key predictors refined using correlation-based approaches. Shared predictors for both types of stroke included rehabilitation assessment, urinary incontinence, stroke unit care, inability to walk independently, physiotherapy, and involvement of stroke care coordinators. The model achieved superior performance in ischaemic stroke, with further validation needed for haemorrhagic stroke in larger cohorts. SHAP analysis provided insights into the importance of these predictors in predicting LOS.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Length of stay (LOS) prediction in acute stroke is critical for improving care planning. Existing machine learning models have shown suboptimal predictive performance, limited generalisability, and have overlooked system-level factors. We aimed to enhance model efficiency, performance, and interpretability by refining predictors and developing an interpretable multi-level stacking ensemble model. Data were accessed from the biennial Stroke Foundation Acute Audit (2015, 2017, 2019, 2021) in Australia. Models were developed for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke separately. The outcome was prolonged LOS (the LOS above the 75th percentile). Candidate predictors (ischaemic: n=89; haemorrhagic: n=83) were categorised into patient, clinical, and system domains. Feature selection with correlation-based approaches was used to refine key predictors. The evaluation of models included discrimination (AUC), calibration curves, and interpretability (SHAP plots). In ischaemic stroke (N=12,575), prolonged LOS was >=9 days, compared to >=11 days in haemorrhagic stroke (N=1,970). The ensemble model achieved superior performance [AUC: 0.824 (95% CI: 0.801-0.846)] and statistically outperformed logistic regression [AUC: 0.805 (95% CI: 0.782-0.829); P=0.0004] for ischaemic. However, the model [AUC: 0.843 (95% CI: 0.790-0.895)] did not statistically outperform logistic regression [AUC: 0.828 (95% CI: 0.774-0.882); P=0.136] for haemorrhagic. SHAP analysis identified shared predictors for both types of stroke: rehabilitation assessment, urinary incontinence, stroke unit care, inability to walk independently, physiotherapy, and stroke care coordinators involvement. An explainable ensemble model effectively predicted the prolonged LOS in ischaemic stroke. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed for haemorrhagic stroke.

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive framework establishing the equivalence between nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and standard feedforward ReLU neural networks. By encoding automaton states as binary vectors and transitions as sparse linear layers, we show that ReLU activations simulate nondeterministic branching, subset construction, and $\epsilon$-closures in a mathematically precise manner. Our core theoretical results prove that a three-layer ReLU network of width $\mathcal{O}(n)$ can exactly recognize any regular language accepted by an $n$-state NFA-without recurrence, memory, or approximation. Furthermore, we show that gradient descent over structure-preserving networks preserves symbolic semantics and acceptance behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple validation tasks-including parallel path tracking, symbolic subset construction, $\epsilon$-closure convergence, acceptance classification, structural training invariants, and functional equivalence-achieve perfect or near-perfect empirical alignment with ground-truth automata. This work provides the first provably complete symbolic simulation of NFAs within standard deep learning architectures, uniting automata theory with neural computation through ReLU dynamics.

Abstract: Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits play a critical role in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. However, automating Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and complexity. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design. However, current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain, lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges. To address this gap, we introduce AMSbench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate MLLM performance across critical tasks including circuit schematic perception, circuit analysis, and circuit design. AMSbench comprises approximately 8000 test questions spanning multiple difficulty levels and assesses eight prominent models, encompassing both open-source and proprietary solutions such as Qwen 2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Our evaluation highlights significant limitations in current MLLMs, particularly in complex multi-modal reasoning and sophisticated circuit design tasks. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' understanding and effective application of circuit-specific knowledge, thereby narrowing the existing performance gap relative to human expertise and moving toward fully automated AMS circuit design workflows.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in scientific machine learning and generative modeling for computational fluid dynamics, we propose a conditional score-based diffusion model designed for multi-scenarios fluid flow prediction. Our model integrates an energy constraint rooted in the statistical properties of turbulent flows, improving prediction quality with minimal training, while enabling efficient sampling at low cost. The method features a simple and general architecture that requires no problem-specific design, supports plug-and-play enhancements, and enables fast and flexible solution generation. It also demonstrates an efficient conditioning mechanism that simplifies training across different scenarios without demanding a redesign of existing models. We further explore various stochastic differential equation formulations to demonstrate how thoughtful design choices enhance performance. We validate the proposed methodology through extensive experiments on complex fluid dynamics datasets encompassing a variety of flow regimes and configurations. Results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves stable, robust, and physically faithful predictions, even under challenging turbulent conditions. With properly tuned parameters, it achieves accurate results across multiple scenarios while preserving key physical and statistical properties. We present a comprehensive analysis of stochastic differential equation impact and discuss our approach across diverse fluid mechanics tasks.

<div> dynamic model update, concept drift, resource constraints, Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework, real-time ML deployments

Summary: 
RCCDA is proposed as a dynamic model update policy for machine learning algorithms facing concept drift in real-world environments. The policy optimizes training dynamics while ensuring strict adherence to predefined resource constraints. By utilizing past loss information and a tunable drift threshold, RCCDA minimizes computational overhead and provides theoretical performance assurances. The policy is developed within a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework that limits update frequency and cost based on accumulated loss thresholds. Experimental results on domain generalization datasets show that RCCDA outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while meeting resource constraints under various concept drift scenarios. This lightweight policy is well-suited for real-time ML deployments, offering a practical and effective solution for maintaining model performance in changing environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms deployed in real-world environments are often faced with the challenge of adapting models to concept drift, where the task data distributions are shifting over time. The problem becomes even more difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while ensuring strict compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy, we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight policy based on a measurable accumulated loss threshold that provably limits update frequency and cost. Experimental results on three domain generalization datasets demonstrate that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.

<title>Biological Pathway Guided Gene Selection Through Collaborative Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Gene selection in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic outcomes. Traditional feature selection methods effectively identify predictive genes but often ignore complex biological pathways and regulatory networks, leading to unstable and biologically irrelevant signatures. Prior approaches, such as Lasso-based methods and statistical filtering, either focus solely on individual gene-outcome associations or fail to capture pathway-level interactions, presenting a key challenge: how to integrate biological pathway knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor in gene selection? To address this gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy that leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information for initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model genes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes both predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates pathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a reward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and pathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and a centralized critic component. Extensive experiments on multiple gene expression datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both prediction accuracy and biological interpretability compared to traditional methods.

<title>Don't Just Follow MLLM Plans: Robust and Efficient Planning for Open-world Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24157</link>

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents capable of mastering complex, multi-step tasks in unpredictable, interactive environments presents a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for planning, existing approaches often rely on problematic internal knowledge or make unrealistic environmental assumptions. Although recent work explores learning planning knowledge, they still retain limitations due to partial reliance on external knowledge or impractical setups. Indeed, prior research has largely overlooked developing agents capable of acquiring planning knowledge from scratch, directly in realistic settings. While realizing this capability is necessary, it presents significant challenges, primarily achieving robustness given the substantial risk of incorporating LLMs' inaccurate knowledge. Moreover, efficiency is crucial for practicality as learning can demand prohibitive exploration. In response, we introduce Robust and Efficient Planning for Open-world Agents (REPOA), a novel framework designed to tackle these issues. REPOA features three key components: adaptive dependency learning and fine-grained failure-aware operation memory to enhance robustness to knowledge inaccuracies, and difficulty-based exploration to improve learning efficiency. Our evaluation in two established open-world testbeds demonstrates REPOA's robust and efficient planning, showcasing its capability to successfully obtain challenging late-game items that were beyond the reach of prior approaches.

<title>Invariant Link Selector for Spatial-Temporal Out-of-Distribution Problem</title>

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, Out-of- Distribution (OOD) problems, i.e., the data discrepancy between the training environments and testing environments, hinder AI generalization. Further, relational data like graphs disobeying the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) condition makes the problem more challenging, especially much harder when it is associated with time. Motivated by this, to realize the robust invariant learning over temporal graphs, we want to investigate what components in temporal graphs are most invariant and representative with respect to labels. With the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, we propose an error-bounded Invariant Link Selector that can distinguish invariant components and variant components during the training process to make the deep learning model generalizable for different testing scenarios. Besides deriving a series of rigorous generalizable optimization functions, we also equip the training with task-specific loss functions, e.g., temporal link prediction, to make pretrained models solve real-world application tasks like citation recommendation and merchandise recommendation, as demonstrated in our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/OOD-Linker.

<title>SALE : Low-bit Estimation for Efficient Sparse Attention in Long-context LLM Prefilling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24179</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24179</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long-context processing, but the self-attention module becomes a bottleneck during the prefilling stage of inference due to its quadratic time complexity with respect to sequence length. Existing sparse attention methods accelerate attention computation by skipping less significant regions of the attention map. However, these approaches typically perform coarse-grained inspection of the attention map, rendering considerable loss in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose SALE, a fine-grained sparse attention method that accelerates the long-context prefilling stage of LLM with negligible loss in model accuracy. SALE achieves fast and accurate fine-grained attention weight estimation through 4-bit quantized query-key products, followed by block-sparse attention to accelerate prefilling computations. For importance evaluation for query-key pairs, we adopt our Relative Attention Score metric, which offers significantly higher efficiency within our framework. We implement a custom CUDA kernel optimized for our approach for hardware efficiency, reducing the additional overhead to approximately 11% of the full attention latency. Notably, SALE requires no parameter training and can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems with trivial code modifications. Experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, achieving at least 3.36x speedups on Llama-3.1-8B for sequences longer than 64K while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

<title>Towards Unified Modeling in Federated Multi-Task Learning via Subspace Decoupling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24185</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) enables multiple clients performing heterogeneous tasks without exchanging their local data, offering broad potential for privacy preserving multi-task collaboration. However, most existing methods focus on building personalized models for each client and unable to support the aggregation of multiple heterogeneous tasks into a unified model. As a result, in real-world scenarios where task objectives, label spaces, and optimization paths vary significantly, conventional FMTL methods struggle to achieve effective joint training. To address this challenge, we propose FedDEA (Federated Decoupled Aggregation), an update-structure-aware aggregation method specifically designed for multi-task model integration. Our method dynamically identifies task-relevant dimensions based on the response strength of local updates and enhances their optimization effectiveness through rescaling. This mechanism effectively suppresses cross-task interference and enables task-level decoupled aggregation within a unified global model. FedDEA does not rely on task labels or architectural modifications, making it broadly applicable and deployment-friendly. Experimental results demonstrate that it can be easily integrated into various mainstream federated optimization algorithms and consistently delivers significant overall performance improvements on widely used NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context. These results validate the robustness and generalization capabilities of FedDEA under highly heterogeneous task settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled training examples. Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them across multiple datasets.

<title>Improved Best-of-Both-Worlds Regret for Bandits with Delayed Feedback</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24193</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multi-armed bandit problem with adversarially chosen delays in the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) framework, which aims to achieve near-optimal performance in both stochastic and adversarial environments. While prior work has made progress toward this goal, existing algorithms suffer from significant gaps to the known lower bounds, especially in the stochastic settings. Our main contribution is a new algorithm that, up to logarithmic factors, matches the known lower bounds in each setting individually.
  In the adversarial case, our algorithm achieves regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{KT} + \sqrt{D})$, which is optimal up to logarithmic terms, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, and $D$ is the cumulative delay. In the stochastic case, we provide a regret bound which scale as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i>0}\left(\log T/\Delta_i\right) + \frac{1}{K}\sum \Delta_i \sigma_{max}$, where $\Delta_i$ is the sub-optimality gap of arm $i$ and $\sigma_{\max}$ is the maximum number of missing observations.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BoBW algorithm to simultaneously match the lower bounds in both stochastic and adversarial regimes in delayed environment. Moreover, even beyond the BoBW setting, our stochastic regret bound is the first to match the known lower bound under adversarial delays, improving the second term over the best known result by a factor of $K$.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in modern deep learning. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical foundations underlying their ability to model complex tasks remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the expressive power of MoEs in modeling complex tasks with two common structural priors: low-dimensionality and sparsity. For shallow MoEs, we prove that they can efficiently approximate functions supported on low-dimensional manifolds, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. For deep MoEs, we show that $\cO(L)$-layer MoEs with $E$ experts per layer can approximate piecewise functions comprising $E^L$ pieces with compositional sparsity, i.e., they can exhibit an exponential number of structured tasks. Our analysis reveals the roles of critical architectural components and hyperparameters in MoEs, including the gating mechanism, expert networks, the number of experts, and the number of layers, and offers natural suggestions for MoE variants.

<title>Dynamic Malware Classification of Windows PE Files using CNNs and Greyscale Images Derived from Runtime API Call Argument Conversion</title>

Abstract: Malware detection and classification remains a topic of concern for cybersecurity, since it is becoming common for attackers to use advanced obfuscation on their malware to stay undetected. Conventional static analysis is not effective against polymorphic and metamorphic malware as these change their appearance without modifying their behavior, thus defying the analysis by code structure alone. This makes it important to use dynamic detection that monitors malware behavior at runtime. In this paper, we present a dynamic malware categorization framework that extracts API argument calls at the runtime execution of Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Extracting and encoding the dynamic features of API names, argument return values, and other relative features, we convert raw behavioral data to temporal patterns. To enhance feature portrayal, the generated patterns are subsequently converted into grayscale pictures using a magma colormap. These improved photos are used to teach a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model discriminative features, which allows for reliable and accurate malware classification. Results from experiments indicate that our method, with an average accuracy of 98.36% is effective in classifying different classes of malware and benign by integrating dynamic analysis and deep learning. It not only achieves high classification accuracy but also demonstrates significant resilience against typical evasion strategies.

Abstract: Variational inference often struggles with the posterior geometry exhibited by complex hierarchical Bayesian models. Recent advances in flow-based variational families and Variationally Inferred Parameters (VIP) each address aspects of this challenge, but their formal relationship is unexplored. Here, we prove that the combination of VIP and a full-rank Gaussian can be represented exactly as a forward autoregressive flow augmented with a translation term and input from the model's prior. Guided by this theoretical insight, we introduce the Model-Informed Flow (MIF) architecture, which adds the necessary translation mechanism, prior information, and hierarchical ordering. Empirically, MIF delivers tighter posterior approximations and matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across a suite of hierarchical and non-hierarchical benchmarks.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to build an agent that can continuously learn a sequence of tasks, where a key challenge, namely Catastrophic Forgetting, persists due to the potential knowledge interference among different tasks. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to converge to a terminal state termed Neural Collapse during training, where all class prototypes geometrically form a static simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). These maximally and equally separated class prototypes make the ETF an ideal target for model learning in CL to mitigate knowledge interference. Thus inspired, several studies have emerged very recently to leverage a fixed global ETF in CL, which however suffers from key drawbacks, such as impracticability and limited performance.To address these challenges and fully unlock the potential of ETF in CL, we propose Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC), a novel framework that completely removes the need of a fixed global ETF in CL. Specifically, ProNC progressively expands the ETF target in a principled way by adding new class prototypes as vertices for new tasks, ensuring maximal separability across all encountered classes with minimal shifts from the previous ETF. We next develop a new CL framework by plugging ProNC into commonly used CL algorithm designs, where distillation is further leveraged to balance between target shifting for old classes and target aligning for new classes. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms related baselines while maintaining superior flexibility, simplicity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Data attribution methods, which quantify the influence of individual training data points on a machine learning model, have gained increasing popularity in data-centric applications in modern AI. Despite a recent surge of new methods developed in this space, the impact of hyperparameter tuning in these methods remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first large-scale empirical study to understand the hyperparameter sensitivity of common data attribution methods. Our results show that most methods are indeed sensitive to certain key hyperparameters. However, unlike typical machine learning algorithms -- whose hyperparameters can be tuned using computationally-cheap validation metrics -- evaluating data attribution performance often requires retraining models on subsets of training data, making such metrics prohibitively costly for hyperparameter tuning. This poses a critical open challenge for the practical application of data attribution methods. To address this challenge, we advocate for better theoretical understandings of hyperparameter behavior to inform efficient tuning strategies. As a case study, we provide a theoretical analysis of the regularization term that is critical in many variants of influence function methods. Building on this analysis, we propose a lightweight procedure for selecting the regularization value without model retraining, and validate its effectiveness across a range of standard data attribution benchmarks. Overall, our study identifies a fundamental yet overlooked challenge in the practical application of data attribution, and highlights the importance of careful discussion on hyperparameter selection in future method development.

Abstract: Model editing techniques, particularly task arithmetic using task vectors, have shown promise in efficiently modifying pre-trained models through arithmetic operations like task addition and negation. Despite computational advantages, these methods may inadvertently affect model fairness, creating risks in sensitive applications like hate speech detection. However, the fairness implications of task arithmetic remain largely unexplored, presenting a critical gap in the existing literature. We systematically examine how manipulating task vectors affects fairness metrics, including Demographic Parity and Equalized Odds. To rigorously assess these effects, we benchmark task arithmetic against full fine-tuning, a costly but widely used baseline, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Additionally, we explore merging task vectors from models fine-tuned on demographic subgroups vulnerable to hate speech, investigating whether fairness outcomes can be controlled by adjusting task vector coefficients, potentially enabling tailored model behavior. Our results offer novel insights into the fairness implications of model editing and establish a foundation for fairness-aware and responsible model editing practices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose GradPower, a lightweight gradient-transformation technique for accelerating language model pre-training. Given a gradient vector $g=(g_i)_i$, GradPower first applies the elementwise sign-power transformation: $\varphi_p(g)=({\rm sign}(g_i)|g_i|^p)_{i}$ for a fixed $p>0$, and then feeds the transformed gradient into a base optimizer. Notably, GradPower requires only a single-line code change and no modifications to the base optimizer's internal logic, including the hyperparameters. When applied to Adam (termed AdamPower), GradPower consistently achieves lower terminal loss across diverse architectures (LLaMA, Qwen2MoE), parameter scales (66M to 2B), datasets (C4, OpenWebText), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). The most pronounced gains are observed when training modern mixture-of-experts models with warmup-stable-decay schedules. GradPower also integrates seamlessly with other state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Muon, yielding further improvements. Finally, we provide theoretical analyses that reveal the underlying mechanism of GradPower and highlights the influence of gradient noise.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token. This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer (and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

<title>AReaL: A Large-Scale Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning System for Language Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a trending paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous by alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts in each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency. Generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before model update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a \emph{fully asynchronous} RL system that completely decouples generation from training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations, leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training, AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks show that AReaL achieves \textbf{up to 2.57$\times$ training speedup} compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs and matched or even improved final performance.

<title>On the Emergence of Weak-to-Strong Generalization: A Bias-Variance Perspective</title>

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) refers to the phenomenon where a strong student model, trained on a dataset labeled by a weak teacher, ultimately outperforms the teacher on the target task. Recent studies attribute this performance gain to the prediction misfit between the student and teacher models. In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG through a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence. Specifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student and teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models. While this aligns with previous results, our analysis removes several restrictive assumptions, most notably, the convexity of the student's hypothesis class, required in earlier works. Moreover, we show that W2SG is more likely to emerge when the student model approximates its posterior mean teacher, rather than mimicking an individual teacher. Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that if the student model has significantly larger capacity than the teacher, it can indeed converge to this posterior mean. Our analysis also suggests that avoiding overfitting to the teacher's supervision and reducing the entropy of student's prediction further facilitate W2SG. In addition, we show that the reverse cross-entropy loss, unlike the standard forward cross-entropy, is less sensitive to the predictive uncertainty of the teacher. Finally, we empirically verify our theoretical insights and demonstrate that incorporating the reverse cross-entropy loss consistently improves student performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in autonomous driving employs a trial-and-error mechanism, enhancing robustness in unpredictable environments. However, crafting effective reward functions remains challenging, as conventional approaches rely heavily on manual design and demonstrate limited efficacy in complex scenarios. To address this issue, this study introduces a responsibility-oriented reward function that explicitly incorporates traffic regulations into the RL framework. Specifically, we introduced a Traffic Regulation Knowledge Graph and leveraged Vision-Language Models alongside Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques to automate reward assignment. This integration guides agents to adhere strictly to traffic laws, thus minimizing rule violations and optimizing decision-making performance in diverse driving conditions. Experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly improves the accuracy of assigning accident responsibilities and effectively reduces the agent's liability in traffic incidents.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant advancements in code generation. However, most evaluation benchmarks are primarily oriented towards Python, making it difficult to evaluate other programming languages, such as Swift, with high quality. By examining widely established multilingual benchmarks like HumanEval-XL and MultiPL-E, we identified critical issues specific to their Swift components, making them insufficient or even irrelevant for assessing LLM coding capabilities on Swift. Unlike these existing approaches, which prioritize rapid scaling and generalization by automatically translating Python-centric benchmarks with LLMs, we adopt a quality-over-quantity methodology. We present SwiftEval, the first Swift-oriented benchmark consisting of 28 carefully hand-crafted problems, and evaluate 44 popular Code LLMs on it. Our results show significant LLM scores drop for problems requiring language-specific features, most noticeable in the models of smaller sizes.

Abstract: Hyperbolic deep learning leverages the metric properties of hyperbolic spaces to develop efficient and informative embeddings of hierarchical data. Here, we focus on the solvable group structure of hyperbolic spaces, which follows naturally from their construction as symmetric spaces. This dual nature of Lie group and Riemannian manifold allows us to propose a new class of hyperbolic deep learning algorithms where group homomorphisms are interleaved with metric-preserving diffeomorphisms. The resulting algorithms, which we call Cartan networks, show promising results on various benchmark data sets and open the way to a novel class of hyperbolic deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance, yet their capability on long-context reasoning is often constrained by the excessive memory required to store the Key-Value (KV) cache. This makes KV cache compression an essential step toward enabling efficient long-context reasoning. Recent methods have explored reducing the hidden dimensions of the KV cache, but many introduce additional computation through projection layers or suffer from significant performance degradation under high compression ratios. To address these challenges, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training KV cache compression method that reduces the hidden dimensions of the KV cache. We develop distinct compression strategies for Keys and Values based on their different roles and varying importance in the attention mechanism. For Keys, we propose Head-wise Similarity-aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters similar heads and applies grouped SVD to the key projection matrix, reducing additional computation while preserving accuracy. For Values, we propose Offline Calibration and Matrix Fusion (OCMF) to preserve accuracy without extra computational overhead. Experiments show that ReCalKV outperforms existing low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance loss. Code is available at: https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/ReCalKV.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a promising new approach for decomposing language model activations for interpretation and control. They have been applied successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable interpretability to SAEs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified approach to cluster refinement and anomaly detection in datasets. We propose a novel algorithm that iteratively reduces the intra-cluster variance of N clusters until a global minimum is reached, yielding tighter clusters than the standard k-means algorithm. We evaluate the method using intrinsic measures for unsupervised learning, including the silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index, and extend it to anomaly detection by identifying points whose assignment causes a significant variance increase. External validation on synthetic data and the UCI Breast Cancer and UCI Wine Quality datasets employs the Jaccard similarity score, V-measure, and F1 score. Results show variance reductions of 18.7% and 88.1% on the synthetic and Wine Quality datasets, respectively, along with accuracy and F1 score improvements of 22.5% and 20.8% on the Wine Quality dataset.

<title>Adversarial Preference Learning for Robust LLM Alignment</title>

Abstract: Modern language models often rely on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to encourage safe behaviors. However, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to three key limitations: (1) the inefficiency and high cost of human annotation, (2) the vast diversity of potential adversarial attacks, and (3) the risk of feedback bias and reward hacking. To address these challenges, we introduce Adversarial Preference Learning (APL), an iterative adversarial training method incorporating three key innovations. First, a direct harmfulness metric based on the model's intrinsic preference probabilities, eliminating reliance on external assessment. Second, a conditional generative attacker that synthesizes input-specific adversarial variations. Third, an iterative framework with automated closed-loop feedback, enabling continuous adaptation through vulnerability discovery and mitigation. Experiments on Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 demonstrate that APL significantly enhances robustness, achieving 83.33% harmlessness win rate over the base model (evaluated by GPT-4o), reducing harmful outputs from 5.88% to 0.43% (measured by LLaMA-Guard), and lowering attack success rate by up to 65% according to HarmBench. Notably, APL maintains competitive utility, with an MT-Bench score of 6.59 (comparable to the baseline 6.78) and an LC-WinRate of 46.52% against the base model.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in offline multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) have harnessed the powerful capabilities of the Transformer architecture, most approaches focus on a limited number of tasks, with scaling to extremely massive tasks remaining a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates. Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT) backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability, successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.

<title>Breaking the Gold Standard: Extracting Forgotten Data under Exact Unlearning in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2505.24379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard, believed to be robust against privacy-related attacks. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by introducing a novel data extraction attack that compromises even exact unlearning. Our method leverages both the pre- and post-unlearning models: by guiding the post-unlearning model using signals from the pre-unlearning model, we uncover patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer enhances the generalization ability of the machine learning model by exploring the flat minima landscape through weight perturbations. Despite its empirical success, SAM introduces an additional hyper-parameter, the perturbation radius, which causes the sensitivity of SAM to it. Moreover, it has been proved that the perturbation radius and learning rate of SAM are constrained by problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. These limitations indicate the requirement of parameter-tuning in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the algorithm LightSAM which sets the perturbation radius and learning rate of SAM adaptively, thus extending the application scope of SAM. LightSAM employs three popular adaptive optimizers, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad and Adam, to replace the SGD optimizer for weight perturbation and model updating, reducing sensitivity to parameters. Theoretical results show that under weak assumptions, LightSAM could converge ideally with any choices of perturbation radius and learning rate, thus achieving parameter-agnostic. We conduct preliminary experiments on several deep learning tasks, which together with the theoretical findings validate the the effectiveness of LightSAM.

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important properties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior work has focused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as sets or multisets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data. These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function, such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether these aggregation functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions. Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as an imperative machine learning tool to solve multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been successfully applied to healthcare, marketing, and biomedical fields. However, in order to borrow information across different tasks effectively, it is essential to utilize both homogeneous and heterogeneous information. Among the extensive literature on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity are presented in MTL problems, such as block-wise, distribution, and posterior heterogeneity. Existing methods, however, struggle to tackle these forms of heterogeneity simultaneously in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a two-step learning strategy for MTL which addresses the aforementioned heterogeneity. First, we impute the missing blocks using shared representations extracted from homogeneous source across different tasks. Next, we disentangle the mappings between input features and responses into a shared component and a task-specific component, respectively, thereby enabling information borrowing through the shared component. Our numerical experiments and real-data analysis from the ADNI database demonstrate the superior MTL performance of the proposed method compared to other competing methods.

Abstract: Automated evaluation of movement quality holds significant potential for enhancing physiotherapeutic treatments and sports training by providing objective, real-time feedback. However, the effectiveness of deep learning models in assessing movements captured by inertial measurement units (IMUs) is often hampered by limited data availability, class imbalance, and label ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel data augmentation method that generates realistic IMU data using musculoskeletal simulations integrated with systematic modifications of movement trajectories. Crucially, our approach ensures biomechanical plausibility and allows for automatic, reliable labeling by combining inverse kinematic parameters with a knowledge-based evaluation strategy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that augmented variants closely resembles real-world data, significantly improving the classification accuracy and generalization capability of neural network models. Additionally, we highlight the benefits of augmented data for patient-specific fine-tuning scenarios, particularly when only limited subject-specific training examples are available. Our findings underline the practicality and efficacy of this augmentation method in overcoming common challenges faced by deep learning applications in physiotherapeutic exercise evaluation.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our models and code are available at https://clic-compositional-clip.github.io

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

Abstract: An important characteristic of temporal graphs is how the directed arrow of time influences their causal topology, i.e., which nodes can possibly influence each other causally via time-respecting paths. The resulting patterns are often neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap, we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms. We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal graph classification experiment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools but pose significant safety risks through harmful outputs and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We propose SaP, short for Safety Polytope, a geometric approach to LLM safety that learns and enforces multiple safety constraints directly in the model's representation space. We develop a framework that identifies safe and unsafe regions via the polytope's facets, enabling both detection and correction of unsafe outputs through geometric steering. Unlike existing approaches that modify model weights, SaP operates post-hoc in the representation space, preserving model capabilities while enforcing safety constraints. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that our method can effectively detect unethical inputs, reduce adversarial attack success rates while maintaining performance on standard tasks, thus highlighting the importance of having an explicit geometric model for safety. Analysis of the learned polytope facets reveals emergence of specialization in detecting different semantic notions of safety, providing interpretable insights into how safety is captured in LLMs' representation space.

Abstract: The expanding computational costs and limited resources underscore the critical need for budgeted-iteration training, which aims to achieve optimal learning within predetermined iteration budgets.While learning rate schedules fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks, particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations.In addition, the optimal learning rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training process inefficient.In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA) schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under different constrained training budgets.First, we bridge the gap by constructing a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts for the robustness to landscape curvature variations.From this framework, we derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter $\varphi$ that provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical connection between $\varphi$ and the condition number, adding interpretation and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for different values of $\varphi$.We offer practical guidelines for its selection via theoretical analysis and empirical results.xtensive experimental results show that UBA \textit{consistently surpasses} the commonly-used schedules across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g., ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.

Abstract: The core of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to learn the in-distribution (ID) representation, which is distinguishable from OOD samples. Previous work applied recognition-based methods to learn the ID features, which tend to learn shortcuts instead of comprehensive representations. In this work, we find surprisingly that simply using reconstruction-based methods could boost the performance of OOD detection significantly. We deeply explore the main contributors of OOD detection and find that reconstruction-based pretext tasks have the potential to provide a generally applicable and efficacious prior, which benefits the model in learning intrinsic data distributions of the ID dataset. Specifically, we take Masked Image Modeling as a pretext task for our OOD detection framework (MOOD). Without bells and whistles, MOOD outperforms previous SOTA of one-class OOD detection by 5.7%, multi-class OOD detection by 3.0%, and near-distribution OOD detection by 2.1%. It even defeats the 10-shot-per-class outlier exposure OOD detection, although we do not include any OOD samples for our detection. Codes are available at https://github.com/JulietLJY/MOOD.

Abstract: Compressing and pruning large machine learning models has become a critical step towards their deployment in real-world applications. Standard pruning and compression techniques are typically designed without taking the structure of the network's weights into account, limiting their effectiveness. We explore the impact of smooth regularization on neural network training and model compression. By applying nuclear norm, first- and second-order derivative penalties of the weights during training, we encourage structured smoothness while preserving predictive performance on par with non-smooth models. We find that standard pruning methods often perform better when applied to these smooth models. Building on this observation, we apply a Singular-Value-Decomposition-based compression method that exploits the underlying smooth structure and approximates the model's weight tensors by smaller low-rank tensors. Our approach enables state-of-the-art compression without any fine-tuning - reaching up to $91\%$ accuracy on a smooth ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 with $70\%$ fewer parameters.

<title>Train One Sparse Autoencoder Across Multiple Sparsity Budgets to Preserve Interpretability and Accuracy</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be powerful tools for interpreting neural networks by decomposing hidden representations into disentangled, interpretable features via sparsity constraints. However, conventional SAEs are constrained by the fixed sparsity level chosen during training; meeting different sparsity requirements therefore demands separate models and increases the computational footprint during both training and evaluation. We introduce a novel training objective, \emph{HierarchicalTopK}, which trains a single SAE to optimise reconstructions across multiple sparsity levels simultaneously. Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance, outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels. Further analysis shows that HierarchicalTopK preserves high interpretability scores even at higher sparsity. The proposed objective thus closes an important gap between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design.

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models, boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings. The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

Abstract: Recent work in online speech spectrogram inversion effectively combines Deep Learning with the Gradient Theorem to predict phase derivatives directly from magnitudes. Then, phases are estimated from their derivatives via least squares, resulting in a high quality reconstruction. In this work, we introduce three innovations that drastically reduce computational cost, while maintaining high quality: Firstly, we introduce a novel neural network architecture with just 8k parameters, 30 times smaller than previous state of the art. Secondly, increasing latency by 1 hop size allows us to further halve the cost of the neural inference step. Thirdly, we we observe that the least squares problem features a tridiagonal matrix and propose a linear-complexity solver for the least squares step that leverages tridiagonality and positive-semidefiniteness, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We release samples online.

Abstract: The Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problem plays a crucial role in power system operations, ensuring voltage stability and minimizing power losses. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly within the ``learning to optimize'' framework, have enabled fast and efficient approximations of ORPD solutions, typically by training models on precomputed optimization results. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance on synthetic datasets, their effectiveness under real-world grid conditions remains largely unexplored. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce a publicly available power system dataset that includes both the structural characteristics of Uruguay's electrical grid and nearly two years of real-world operational data, encompassing actual demand and generation profiles. Given Uruguay's high penetration of renewable energy, the ORPD problem has become the primary optimization challenge in its power network. Second, we assess the impact of real-world data on learning-based ORPD solutions, revealing a significant increase in prediction errors when transitioning from synthetic to actual demand and generation inputs. Our results highlight the limitations of existing models in learning under the complex statistical properties of real grid conditions and emphasize the need for more expressive architectures. By providing this dataset, we aim to facilitate further research into robust learning-based optimization techniques for power system management.

<title>Can Slow-thinking LLMs Reason Over Time? Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.

Abstract: Deep Learning, driven by neural networks, has led to groundbreaking advancements in Artificial Intelligence by enabling systems to learn and adapt like the human brain. These models have achieved remarkable results, particularly in data-intensive domains, supported by massive computational infrastructure. However, deploying such systems in Aerospace, where real time data processing and ultra low latency are critical, remains a challenge due to infrastructure limitations. This paper proposes a novel concept: the Airborne Neural Network a distributed architecture where multiple airborne devices each host a subset of neural network neurons. These devices compute collaboratively, guided by an airborne network controller and layer specific controllers, enabling real-time learning and inference during flight. This approach has the potential to revolutionize Aerospace applications, including airborne air traffic control, real-time weather and geographical predictions, and dynamic geospatial data processing. By enabling large-scale neural network operations in airborne environments, this work lays the foundation for the next generation of AI powered Aerospace systems.

Abstract: Despite their central role in the success of foundational models and large-scale language modeling, the theoretical foundations governing the operation of Transformers remain only partially understood. Contemporary research has largely focused on their representational capacity for language comprehension and their prowess in in-context learning, frequently under idealized assumptions such as linearized attention mechanisms. Initially conceived to model sequence-to-sequence transformations, a fundamental and unresolved question is whether Transformers can robustly perform functional regression over sequences of input tokens. This question assumes heightened importance given the inherently non-Euclidean geometry underlying real-world data distributions. In this work, we establish that Transformers equipped with softmax-based nonlinear attention are uniformly consistent when tasked with executing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, provided both the inputs and outputs are embedded in hyperbolic space. We derive deterministic upper bounds on the empirical error which, in the asymptotic regime, decay at a provable rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2d})$, where $t$ denotes the number of input tokens and $d$ the embedding dimensionality. Notably, our analysis subsumes the Euclidean setting as a special case, recovering analogous convergence guarantees parameterized by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. These theoretical insights are corroborated through empirical evaluations on real-world datasets involving both continuous and categorical response variables.

<title>Directional Non-Commutative Monoidal Structures with Interchange Law via Commutative Generators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework consisting of a class of algebraic structures that generalize one-dimensional monoidal systems into higher dimensions by defining per-axis composition operators subject to non-commutativity and a global interchange law. These structures, defined recursively from a base case of vector-matrix pairs, model directional composition in multiple dimensions while preserving structural coherence through commutative linear operators.
  We show that the framework that unifies several well-known linear transforms in signal processing and data analysis. In this framework, data indices are embedded into a composite structure that decomposes into simpler components. We show that classic transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the Walsh transform, and the Hadamard transform are special cases of our algebraic structure. The framework provides a systematic way to derive these transforms by appropriately choosing vector and matrix pairs. By subsuming classical transforms within a common structure, the framework also enables the development of learnable transformations tailored to specific data modalities and tasks.

arXiv:2505.24534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose HLSAD, a novel method for detecting anomalies in time-evolving simplicial complexes. While traditional graph anomaly detection techniques have been extensively studied, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order interactions that are crucial for identifying complex structural anomalies. These higher-order interactions can arise either directly from the underlying data itself or through graph lifting techniques. Our approach leverages the spectral properties of Hodge Laplacians of simplicial complexes to effectively model multi-way interactions among data points. By incorporating higher-dimensional simplicial structures into our method, our method enhances both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing graph methods in detecting both events and change points.

Abstract: Controlling multiple behavioral attributes in large language models (LLMs) at inference time is a challenging problem due to interference between attributes and the limitations of linear steering methods, which assume additive behavior in activation space and require per-attribute tuning. We introduce K-Steering, a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.

<title>Neuro-Symbolic Operator for Interpretable and Generalizable Characterization of Complex Piezoelectric Systems</title>

Abstract: Complex piezoelectric systems are foundational in industrial applications. Their performance, however, is challenged by the nonlinear voltage-displacement hysteretic relationships. Efficient characterization methods are, therefore, essential for reliable design, monitoring, and maintenance. Recently proposed neural operator methods serve as surrogates for system characterization but face two pressing issues: interpretability and generalizability. State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural operators are black-boxes, providing little insight into the learned operator. Additionally, generalizing them to novel voltages and predicting displacement profiles beyond the training domain is challenging, limiting their practical use. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a neuro-symbolic operator (NSO) framework that derives the analytical operators governing hysteretic relationships. NSO first learns a Fourier neural operator mapping voltage fields to displacement profiles, followed by a library-based sparse model discovery method, generating white-box parsimonious models governing the underlying hysteresis. These models enable accurate and interpretable prediction of displacement profiles across varying and out-of-distribution voltage fields, facilitating generalizability. The potential of NSO is demonstrated by accurately predicting voltage-displacement hysteresis, including butterfly-shaped relationships. Moreover, NSO predicts displacement profiles even for noisy and low-fidelity voltage data, emphasizing its robustness. The results highlight the advantages of NSO compared to SOTA neural operators and model discovery methods on several evaluation metrics. Consequently, NSO contributes to characterizing complex piezoelectric systems while improving the interpretability and generalizability of neural operators, essential for design, monitoring, maintenance, and other real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have recently emerged as a promising and efficient approach for learning the numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) from data. However, standard FNO often fails to preserve key conservation laws, such as mass conservation, momentum conservation, norm conservation, etc., which are crucial for accurately modeling physical systems. Existing methods for incorporating these conservation laws into Fourier neural operators are achieved by designing related loss function or incorporating post-processing method at the training time. None of them can both exactly and adaptively correct the outputs to satisfy conservation laws, and our experiments show that these methods can lead to inferior performance while preserving conservation laws. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive correction approach to ensure the conservation of fundamental quantities. Our method introduces a learnable matrix to adaptively adjust the solution to satisfy the conservation law during training. It ensures that the outputs exactly satisfy the goal conservation law and allow for more flexibility and adaptivity for the model to correct the outputs. We theoretically show that applying our adaptive correction to an unconstrained FNO yields a solution with data loss no worse than that of the best conservation-satisfying FNO. We compare our approach with existing methods on a range of representative PDEs. Experiment results show that our method consistently outperform other methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel chemicals and materials; however, transitioning these discoveries to industrial-scale production remains a critical bottleneck, as it requires the development of entirely new chemical manufacturing processes. Current AI methods cannot auto-generate PFDs or PIDs, despite their critical role in scaling chemical processes, while adhering to engineering constraints. We present a closed loop, physics aware framework for the automated generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates domain specialized small scale language models (SLMs) (trained for chemical process QA tasks) with first principles simulation, leveraging three key components: (1) a hierarchical knowledge graph of process flow and instrumentation descriptions for 1,020+ chemicals, (2) a multi-stage training pipeline that fine tunes domain specialized SLMs on synthetic datasets via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning (RAIT), and (3) DWSIM based simulator in the loop validation to ensure feasibility. To improve both runtime efficiency and model compactness, the framework incorporates advanced inference time optimizations including FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization, and Test Time Inference Scaling and independently applies structural pruning techniques (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce model size with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments demonstrate that the framework generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity, outperforms baseline methods in correctness, and generalizes to unseen chemicals. By bridging AI-driven design with industrial-scale feasibility, this work significantly reduces R&amp;D timelines from lab discovery to plant deployment.

Abstract: Model robustness indicates a model's capability to generalize well on unforeseen distributional shifts, including data corruption, adversarial attacks, and domain shifts. Data augmentation is one of the prevalent and effective ways to enhance robustness. Despite the great success of augmentations in different fields, a general theoretical understanding of their efficacy in improving model robustness is lacking. We offer a unified theoretical framework to clarify how augmentations can enhance model robustness through the lens of loss surface flatness and PAC generalization bound. Our work diverges from prior studies in that our analysis i) broadly encompasses much of the existing augmentation methods, and ii) is not limited to specific types of distribution shifts like adversarial attacks. We confirm our theories through simulations on the existing common corruption and adversarial robustness benchmarks based on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, as well as domain generalization benchmarks including PACS and OfficeHome.

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.

Abstract: Gaussian sketching, which consists of pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, is a widely used technique for multiple problems in data science and machine learning, with applications spanning computationally efficient optimization, coded computing, and federated learning. This operation also provides differential privacy guarantees due to its inherent randomness. In this work, we revisit this operation through the lens of Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP), providing a refined privacy analysis that yields significantly tighter bounds than prior results. We then demonstrate how this improved analysis leads to performance improvement in different linear regression settings, establishing theoretical utility guarantees. Empirically, our methods improve performance across multiple datasets and, in several cases, reduce runtime.

Abstract: Explainability is crucial for improving the transparency of black-box machine learning models. With the advancement of explanation methods such as LIME and SHAP, various XAI performance metrics have been developed to evaluate the quality of explanations. However, different explainers can provide contrasting explanations for the same prediction, introducing trade-offs across conflicting quality metrics. Although available aggregation approaches improve robustness, reducing explanations' variability, very limited research employed a multi-criteria decision-making approach. To address this gap, this paper introduces a multi-criteria rank-based weighted aggregation method that balances multiple quality metrics simultaneously to produce an ensemble of explanation models. Furthermore, we propose rank-based versions of existing XAI metrics (complexity, faithfulness and stability) to better evaluate ranked feature importance explanations. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model across these metrics. Comparative analyses of various multi-criteria decision-making and rank aggregation algorithms showed that TOPSIS and WSUM are the best candidates for this use case.

Abstract: To address the computational and storage challenges posed by large-scale datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points, overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model performance, while significantly improving training stability. Notably, HDD is seamlessly compatible with most existing DM methods, and extensive experiments on different datasets validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various constraint tightness degrees.

Abstract: Penalties are fraught and game-changing moments in soccer games that teams explicitly prepare for. Consequently, there has been substantial interest in analyzing them in order to provide advice to practitioners. From a data science perspective, such analyses suffer from a significant limitation: they make the unrealistic simplifying assumption that goalkeepers and takers select their action -- where to dive and where to the place the kick -- independently of each other. In reality, the choices that some goalkeepers make depend on the taker's movements and vice-versa. This adds substantial complexity to the problem because not all players have the same action capacities, that is, only some players are capable of basing their decisions on their opponent's movements. However, the small sample sizes on the player level mean that one may have limited insights into a specific opponent's capacities. We address these challenges by developing a player-agnostic simulation framework that can evaluate the efficacy of different goalkeeper strategies. It considers a rich set of choices and incorporates information about a goalkeeper's skills. Our work is grounded in a large dataset of penalties that were annotated by penalty experts and include aspects of both kicker and goalkeeper strategies. We show how our framework can be used to optimize goalkeeper policies in real-world situations.

Abstract: We investigate the distance function learned by message passing neural networks (MPNNs) in specific tasks, aiming to capture the functional distance between prediction targets that MPNNs implicitly learn. This contrasts with previous work, which links MPNN distances on arbitrary tasks to structural distances on graphs that ignore task-specific information. To address this gap, we distill the distance between MPNN embeddings into an interpretable graph distance. Our method uses optimal transport on the Weisfeiler Leman Labeling Tree (WILT), where the edge weights reveal subgraphs that strongly influence the distance between embeddings. This approach generalizes two well-known graph kernels and can be computed in linear time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MPNNs define the relative position of embeddings by focusing on a small set of subgraphs that are known to be functionally important in the domain.

<title>Learning Distributions over Permutations and Rankings with Factorized Representations</title>

Abstract: Learning distributions over permutations is a fundamental problem in machine learning, with applications in ranking, combinatorial optimization, structured prediction, and data association. Existing methods rely on mixtures of parametric families or neural networks with expensive variational inference procedures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages alternative representations for permutations, including Lehmer codes, Fisher-Yates draws, and Insertion-Vectors. These representations form a bijection with the symmetric group, allowing for unconstrained learning using conventional deep learning techniques, and can represent any probability distribution over permutations. Our approach enables a trade-off between expressivity of the model family and computational requirements. In the least expressive and most computationally efficient case, our method subsumes previous families of well established probabilistic models over permutations, including Mallow's and the Repeated Insertion Model. Experiments indicate our method significantly outperforms current approaches on the jigsaw puzzle benchmark, a common task for permutation learning. However, we argue this benchmark is limited in its ability to assess learning probability distributions, as the target is a delta distribution (i.e., a single correct solution exists). We therefore propose two additional benchmarks: learning cyclic permutations and re-ranking movies based on user preference. We show that our method learns non-trivial distributions even in the least expressive mode, while traditional models fail to even generate valid permutations in this setting.

Abstract: Real world data often lie on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces. This motivates learning degenerate normalizing flows that map between the ambient space and a low-dimensional latent space. However, if the manifold has a non-trivial topology, it can never be correctly learned using a single flow. Instead multiple flows must be `glued together'. In this paper, we first propose the general training scheme for learning such a collection of flows, and secondly we develop the first numerical algorithms for computing geodesics on such manifolds. Empirically, we demonstrate that this leads to highly significant improvements in topology estimation.

Abstract: Despite well-documented consequences of the U.S. government's 1930s housing policies on racial wealth disparities, scholars have struggled to quantify its precise financial effects due to the inaccessibility of historical property appraisal records. Many counties still store these records in physical formats, making large-scale quantitative analysis difficult. We present an approach scholars can use to digitize historical housing assessment data, applying it to build and release a dataset for one county. Starting from publicly available scanned documents, we manually annotated property cards for over 12,000 properties to train and validate our methods. We use OCR to label data for an additional 50,000 properties, based on our two-stage approach combining classical computer vision techniques with deep learning-based OCR. For cases where OCR cannot be applied, such as when scanned documents are not available, we show how a regression model based on building feature data can estimate the historical values, and test the generalizability of this model to other counties. With these cost-effective tools, scholars, community activists, and policy makers can better analyze and understand the historical impacts of redlining.

<title>Disentangling Granularity: An Implicit Inductive Bias in Factorized VAEs</title>

Abstract: Despite the success in learning semantically meaningful, unsupervised disentangled representations, variational autoencoders (VAEs) and their variants face a fundamental theoretical challenge: substantial evidence indicates that unsupervised disentanglement is unattainable without implicit inductive bias, yet such bias remains elusive. In this work, we focus on exploring the implicit inductive bias that drive disentanglement in VAEs with factorization priors. By analyzing the total correlation in \b{eta}-TCVAE, we uncover a crucial implicit inductive bias called disentangling granularity, which leads to the discovery of an interesting "V"-shaped optimal Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) trajectory within the parameter space. This finding is validated through over 100K experiments using factorized VAEs and our newly proposed model, \b{eta}-STCVAE. Notably, experimental results reveal that conventional factorized VAEs, constrained by fixed disentangling granularity, inherently tend to disentangle low-complexity feature. Whereas, appropriately tuning disentangling granularity, as enabled by \b{eta}-STCVAE, broadens the range of disentangled representations, allowing for the disentanglement of high-complexity features. Our findings unveil that disentangling granularity as an implicit inductive bias in factorized VAEs influence both disentanglement performance and the inference of the ELBO, offering fresh insights into the interpretability and inherent biases of VAEs.

<title>Quick-Draw Bandits: Quickly Optimizing in Nonstationary Environments with Extremely Many Arms</title>

Abstract: Canonical algorithms for multi-armed bandits typically assume a stationary reward environment where the size of the action space (number of arms) is small. More recently developed methods typically relax only one of these assumptions: existing non-stationary bandit policies are designed for a small number of arms, while Lipschitz, linear, and Gaussian process bandit policies are designed to handle a large (or infinite) number of arms in stationary reward environments under constraints on the reward function. In this manuscript, we propose a novel policy to learn reward environments over a continuous space using Gaussian interpolation. We show that our method efficiently learns continuous Lipschitz reward functions with $\mathcal{O}^*(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret. Furthermore, our method naturally extends to non-stationary problems with a simple modification. We finally demonstrate that our method is computationally favorable (100-10000x faster) and experimentally outperforms sliding Gaussian process policies on datasets with non-stationarity and an extremely large number of arms.

<title>On Symmetric Losses for Robust Policy Optimization with Noisy Preferences</title>

Abstract: Optimizing policies based on human preferences is key to aligning language models with human intent. This work focuses on reward modeling, a core component in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and offline preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization. Conventional approaches typically assume accurate annotations. However, real-world preference data often contains noise due to human errors or biases. We propose a principled framework for robust policy optimization under noisy preferences, viewing reward modeling as a classification problem. This allows us to leverage symmetric losses, known for their robustness to label noise in classification, leading to our Symmetric Preference Optimization (SymPO) method. We prove that symmetric losses enable successful policy optimization even under noisy labels, as the resulting reward remains rank-preserving -- a property sufficient for policy improvement. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SymPO.

<title>Causal-aware Large Language Models: Enhancing Decision-Making Through Learning, Adapting and Acting</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in decision-making due to the vast amount of knowledge stored within the models. However, these pre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to adapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex real-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting" paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to initialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the adapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback about the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the environment and make more efficient decisions. Experimental results across 22 diverse tasks within the open-world game ``Crafter" validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench and Long Code Arena's bug localisation datasets, we show that our model substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in achieving these results.

Abstract: We introduce PDE-Transformer, an improved transformer-based architecture for surrogate modeling of physics simulations on regular grids. We combine recent architectural improvements of diffusion transformers with adjustments specific for large-scale simulations to yield a more scalable and versatile general-purpose transformer architecture, which can be used as the backbone for building large-scale foundation models in physical sciences. We demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art transformer architectures for computer vision on a large dataset of 16 different types of PDEs. We propose to embed different physical channels individually as spatio-temporal tokens, which interact via channel-wise self-attention. This helps to maintain a consistent information density of tokens when learning multiple types of PDEs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our pre-trained models achieve improved performance on several challenging downstream tasks compared to training from scratch and also beat other foundation model architectures for physics simulations.

Abstract: Memristor-based hardware offers new possibilities for energy-efficient machine learning (ML) by providing analog in-memory matrix multiplication. Current hardware prototypes cannot fit large neural networks, and related literature covers only small ML models for tasks like MNIST or single word recognition. Simulation can be used to explore how hardware properties affect larger models, but existing software assumes simplified hardware. We propose a PyTorch-based library based on "Synaptogen" to simulate neural network execution with accurately captured memristor hardware properties. For the first time, we show how an ML system with millions of parameters would behave on memristor hardware, using a Conformer trained on the speech recognition task TED-LIUMv2 as example. With adjusted quantization-aware training, we limit the relative degradation in word error rate to 25% when using a 3-bit weight precision to execute linear operations via simulated analog computation.

<title>HELM: Hyperbolic Large Language Models via Mixture-of-Curvature Experts</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in text modeling tasks across domains. However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic hierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture completely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have also shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to training instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These findings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align language models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to operate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and low-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large Language Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM that addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary operations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally introduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert operates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric structure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we further develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient, reduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential hyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We are the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and evaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM problem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show consistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular Euclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy and enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM pretraining.

<title>Robust Federated Learning against Model Perturbation in Edge Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for realizing edge intelligence, allowing collaborative learning among distributed edge devices by sharing models instead of raw data. However, the shared models are often assumed to be ideal, which would be inevitably violated in practice due to various perturbations, leading to significant performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel method, termed Sharpness-Aware Minimization-based Robust Federated Learning (SMRFL), which aims to improve model robustness against perturbations by exploring the geometrical property of the model landscape. Specifically, SMRFL solves a min-max optimization problem that promotes model convergence towards a flat minimum by minimizing the maximum loss within a neighborhood of the model parameters. In this way, model sensitivity to perturbations is reduced, and robustness is enhanced since models in the neighborhood of the flat minimum also enjoy low loss values. The theoretical result proves that SMRFL can converge at the same rate as FL without perturbations. Extensive experimental results show that SMRFL significantly enhances robustness against perturbations compared to three baseline methods on two real-world datasets under three perturbation scenarios.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are a popular approach to explain the behavior of machine learning models. They assign importance scores to each input feature, quantifying their influence on the model's prediction. However, evaluating these methods empirically remains a significant challenge. To bypass this shortcoming, several prior works have proposed axiomatic frameworks that any feature attribution method should satisfy. In this work, we argue that such axioms are often too restrictive, and propose in response a new feature attribution framework, built from the ground up. Rather than imposing axioms, we start by defining attributions for the simplest possible models, i.e., indicator functions, and use these as building blocks for more complex models. We then show that one recovers several existing attribution methods, depending on the choice of atomic attribution. Subsequently, we derive closed-form expressions for attribution of deep ReLU networks, and take a step toward the optimization of evaluation metrics with respect to feature attributions.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM) for binary linear classification. We obtain an efficient $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm with an empirical zero-one risk bound of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^2\varepsilon n} + \frac{|S_{\mathrm{out}}|}{\gamma n}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of data points, $S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is an arbitrary subset of data one can remove and $\gamma$ is the margin of linear separation of the remaining data points (after $S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is removed). Here, $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides only logarithmic terms. In the agnostic case, we improve the existing results when the number of outliers is small. Our algorithm is highly adaptive because it does not require knowing the margin parameter $\gamma$ or outlier subset $S_{\mathrm{out}}$. We also derive a utility bound for the advanced private hyperparameter tuning algorithm.

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance. However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace, enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity. Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Its key innovation is the ability to generate virtually infinite training data with adjustable complexity, unlike most previous reasoning datasets, which are typically fixed. This procedural generation approach allows for continuous evaluation across varying difficulty levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RG in both evaluating and reinforcement learning of reasoning models.

arXiv:2505.24773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous environments in the real world.

We integrate this generative processes with a token-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to conduct efficient reinforcement learning on the given measurement dataset. In addition, we introduce a long short-term risk-seeking policy to expand the pool of top-performing candidates, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is fundamental to solving complex decision-making problems. The proliferation of MILP instance generation methods, driven by machine learning's demand for diverse optimization datasets and the limitations of static benchmarks, has significantly outpaced standardized evaluation techniques. Consequently, assessing the fidelity and utility of synthetic MILP instances remains a critical, multifaceted challenge. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark framework designed for the systematic and objective evaluation of MILP instance generation methods. Our framework provides a unified and extensible methodology, assessing instance quality across crucial dimensions: mathematical validity, structural similarity, computational hardness, and utility in downstream machine learning tasks. A key innovation is its in-depth analysis of solver-internal features -- particularly by comparing distributions of key solver outputs including root node gap, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage -- leveraging the solver's dynamic solution behavior as an `expert assessment' to reveal nuanced computational resemblances. By offering a structured approach with clearly defined solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics, our benchmark aims to facilitate robust comparisons among diverse generation techniques, spur the development of higher-quality instance generators, and ultimately enhance the reliability of research reliant on synthetic MILP data. The framework's effectiveness in systematically comparing the fidelity of instance sets is demonstrated using contemporary generative models.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks converge faster and achieve higher accuracy than classical models. However, data augmentation in quantum machine learning remains underexplored. To tackle data scarcity, we integrate quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) with hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) to develop an augmentation framework. We propose two strategies: a general approach to enhance data processing and classification across HQCNNs, and a customized strategy that dynamically generates samples tailored to the HQCNN's performance on specific data categories, improving its ability to learn from complex datasets. Simulation experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate that QGAN outperforms traditional data augmentation methods and classical GANs. Compared to baseline DCGAN, QGAN achieves comparable performance with half the parameters, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. This suggests that QGANs can simplify models and generate high-quality data, enhancing HQCNN accuracy and performance. These findings pave the way for applying quantum data augmentation techniques in machine learning.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are promising generative models with advantages such as theoretical rigor, analytical log-likelihood computation, and end-to-end training. However, the architectural constraints to ensure invertibility and tractable Jacobian computation limit their expressive power and practical usability. Recent advancements utilize autoregressive modeling, significantly enhancing expressive power and generation quality. However, such sequential modeling inherently restricts parallel computation during inference, leading to slow generation that impedes practical deployment. In this paper, we first identify that strict sequential dependency in inference is unnecessary to generate high-quality samples. We observe that patches in sequential modeling can also be approximated without strictly conditioning on all preceding patches. Moreover, the models tend to exhibit low dependency redundancy in the initial layer and higher redundancy in subsequent layers. Leveraging these observations, we propose a selective Jacobi decoding (SeJD) strategy that accelerates autoregressive inference through parallel iterative optimization. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the method's superlinear convergence rate and guarantee that the number of iterations required is no greater than the original sequential approach. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets validate the generality and effectiveness of our acceleration technique. Experiments demonstrate substantial speed improvements up to 4.7 times faster inference while keeping the generation quality and fidelity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics. Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise, principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.

<title>Timing is important: Risk-aware Fund Allocation based on Time-Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.

<title>Cascading Adversarial Bias from Injection to Distillation in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable language models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation, adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements, phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses - perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective adversarial bias mitigation strategies.

<title>From Invariant Representations to Invariant Data: Provable Robustness to Spurious Correlations via Noisy Counterfactual Matching</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24843</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24843</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spurious correlations can cause model performance to degrade in new environments. Prior causality-inspired works aim to learn invariant representations (e.g., IRM) but typically underperform empirical risk minimization (ERM). Recent alternatives improve robustness by leveraging test-time data, but such data may be unavailable in practice. To address these issues, we take a data-centric approach by leveraging invariant data pairs, pairs of samples that would have the same prediction with the optimally robust classifier. We prove that certain counterfactual pairs will naturally satisfy this invariance property and introduce noisy counterfactual matching (NCM), a simple constraint-based method for leveraging invariant pairs for enhanced robustness, even with a small set of noisy pairs-in the ideal case, each pair can eliminate one spurious feature. For linear causal models, we prove that the test domain error can be upper bounded by the in-domain error and a term that depends on the counterfactuals' diversity and quality. We validate on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate on real-world benchmarks that linear probing on a pretrained backbone improves robustness.

Abstract: Training data mixtures greatly impact the generalization performance of large language models. Existing domain reweighting methods often rely on costly weight computations and require retraining when new data is introduced. To this end, we introduce a flexible and efficient data mixing framework, Chameleon, that employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned embedding space. We first construct a domain affinity matrix over domain embeddings. The induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights domains sharing common representations in embedding space. This formulation allows direct transfer to new data by computing the new domain embeddings. In experiments, we demonstrate improvements over three key scenarios: (i) our computed weights improve performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of the compute of existing methods; (ii) Chameleon can adapt to data changes without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when transferred to new data; (iii) our method enables efficient domain reweighting in finetuning, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains over uniform mixture. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Chameleon.

<title>Harnessing Negative Signals: Reinforcement Distillation from Teacher Data for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However, standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1). Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models post-trained offline with openly available data.

<title>Accelerated Sampling from Masked Diffusion Models via Entropy Bounded Unmasking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown competitive performance compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) for language modeling. While most literature has focused on performance enhancing sampling procedures, efficient sampling from MDMs has been scarcely explored. We make the observation that often a given sequence of partially masked tokens determines the values of multiple unknown tokens deterministically, meaning that a single prediction of a masked model holds additional information unused by standard sampling procedures. Based on this observation, we introduce EB-Sampler, a simple drop-in replacement for existing samplers, utilizing an Entropy Bounded unmasking procedure that dynamically unmasks multiple tokens in one function evaluation with predefined approximate error tolerance. We formulate the EB-Sampler as part of a broad family of adaptive samplers for which we provide an error analysis that motivates our algorithmic choices. EB-Sampler accelerates sampling from current state of the art MDMs by roughly 2-3x on standard coding and math reasoning benchmarks without loss in performance. We also validate the same procedure works well on smaller reasoning tasks including maze navigation and Sudoku, tasks ARMs often struggle with.

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far, steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings, while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied. Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.

<title>The Road to Generalizable Neuro-Symbolic Learning Should be Paved with Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic learning was proposed to address challenges with training neural networks for complex reasoning tasks with the added benefits of interpretability, reliability, and efficiency. Neuro-symbolic learning methods traditionally train neural models in conjunction with symbolic programs, but they face significant challenges that limit them to simplistic problems. On the other hand, purely-neural foundation models now reach state-of-the-art performance through prompting rather than training, but they are often unreliable and lack interpretability. Supplementing foundation models with symbolic programs, which we call neuro-symbolic prompting, provides a way to use these models for complex reasoning tasks. Doing so raises the question: What role does specialized model training as part of neuro-symbolic learning have in the age of foundation models? To explore this question, we highlight three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic learning with respect to the compute, data, and programs leading to generalization problems. This position paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch.

Abstract: This contribution introduces a dataset of 7th-order Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs), created using the Image Source Method. By employing higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio, particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.

<title>Combining Abstract Argumentation and Machine Learning for Efficiently Analyzing Low-Level Process Event Streams</title>

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way. However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent constraints.

<title>Few-Shot Optimization for Sensor Data Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Fatigue Detection</title>

arXiv:2505.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models (LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition, fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection (59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified AI framework for high-accuracy audio anomaly detection by integrating advanced noise reduction, feature extraction, and machine learning modeling techniques. The approach combines spectral subtraction and adaptive filtering to enhance audio quality, followed by feature extraction using traditional methods like MFCCs and deep embeddings from pre-trained models such as OpenL3. The modeling pipeline incorporates classical models (SVM, Random Forest), deep learning architectures (CNNs), and ensemble methods to boost robustness and accuracy. Evaluated on benchmark datasets including TORGO and LibriSpeech, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in precision, recall, and classification of slurred vs. normal speech. This work addresses challenges in noisy environments and real-time applications and provides a scalable solution for audio-based anomaly detection.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation. This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised framework for detecting audio patterns in musical samples (loops) through anomaly detection techniques, addressing challenges in music information retrieval (MIR). Existing methods are often constrained by reliance on handcrafted features, domain-specific limitations, or dependence on iterative user interaction. We address these limitations through an architecture combining deep feature extraction with unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a pre-trained Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT), paired with a Feature Fusion Mechanism (FFM), to generate representations from variable-length audio loops. These embeddings are processed using one-class Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD), which learns normative audio patterns by mapping them to a compact latent hypersphere. Evaluations on curated bass and guitar datasets compare standard and residual autoencoder variants against baselines like Isolation Forest (IF) and and principle component analysis (PCA) methods. Results show our Deep SVDD models, especially the residual autoencoder variant, deliver improved anomaly separation, particularly for larger variations. This research contributes a flexible, fully unsupervised solution for processing diverse audio samples, overcoming previous structural and input limitations while enabling effective pattern identification through distance-based latent space scoring.

<title>Mind the Gap: A Practical Attack on GGUF Quantization</title>

Abstract: With the increasing size of frontier LLMs, post-training quantization has become the standard for memory-efficient deployment. Recent work has shown that basic rounding-based quantization schemes pose security risks, as they can be exploited to inject malicious behaviors into quantized models that remain hidden in full precision. However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more complex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular ollama and llama.cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization error -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their (de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct malicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging this, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while constraining its weights based on quantization errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on three popular LLMs across nine GGUF quantization data types on three diverse attack scenarios: insecure code generation ($\Delta$=$88.7\%$), targeted content injection ($\Delta$=$85.0\%$), and benign instruction refusal ($\Delta$=$30.1\%$). Our attack highlights that (1) the most widely used post-training quantization method is susceptible to adversarial interferences, and (2) the complexity of quantization schemes alone is insufficient as a defense.

Abstract: We are living in an era of "big literature", where the volume of digital scientific publications is growing exponentially. While offering new opportunities, this also poses challenges for understanding literature landscapes, as traditional manual reviewing is no longer feasible. Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities for literature comprehension, yet they are incapable of offering "comprehensive, objective, open and transparent" views desired by systematic reviews due to their limited context windows and trust issues like hallucinations. Here we present LitChat, an end-to-end, interactive and conversational literature agent that augments LLM agents with data-driven discovery tools to facilitate literature exploration. LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant sources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining techniques to generate evidence-based insights addressing user needs. We illustrate the effectiveness of LitChat via a case study on AI4Health, highlighting its capacity to quickly navigate the users through large-scale literature landscape with data-based evidence that is otherwise infeasible with traditional means.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning framework designed to protect client data, yet it remains highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property (IP) threats. Model extraction (ME) attacks pose a significant risk to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, enabling attackers to replicate confidential models by querying black-box (without internal insight) APIs. Despite FL's privacy-preserving goals, its distributed nature makes it particularly susceptible to such attacks. This paper examines the vulnerability of FL-based victim models to two types of model extraction attacks. For various federated clients built under the NVFlare platform, we implemented ME attacks across two deep learning architectures and three image datasets. We evaluate the proposed ME attack performance using various metrics, including accuracy, fidelity, and KL divergence. The experiments show that for different FL clients, the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted model are closely related to the size of the attack query set. Additionally, we explore a transfer learning based approach where pretrained models serve as the starting point for the extraction process. The results indicate that the accuracy and fidelity of the fine-tuned pretrained extraction models are notably higher, particularly with smaller query sets, highlighting potential advantages for attackers.

Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class classification task and propose a RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA Hybrid model, integrating the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.

<title>Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.

Abstract: Background: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However, applying FL to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks presents unique challenges due to semantic heterogeneity across clients, vocabulary mismatches, and varying resource constraints on edge devices. Objectives: This paper introduces SEMFED, a novel semantic-aware resource-efficient federated learning framework specifically designed for heterogeneous NLP tasks. Methods: SEMFED incorporates three key innovations: (1) a semantic-aware client selection mechanism that balances semantic diversity with resource constraints, (2) adaptive NLP-specific model architectures tailored to device capabilities while preserving semantic information, and (3) a communication-efficient semantic feature compression technique that significantly reduces bandwidth requirements. Results: Experimental results on various NLP classification tasks demonstrate that SEMFED achieves an 80.5% reduction in communication costs while maintaining model accuracy above 98%, outperforming state-of-the-art FL approaches. Conclusion: SEMFED effectively manages heterogeneous client environments with varying computational resources, network reliability, and semantic data distributions, making it particularly suitable for real-world federated NLP deployments.

<title>Calibrating LLMs for Text-to-SQL Parsing by Leveraging Sub-clause Frequencies</title>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration, provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency" (SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection over traditional Platt scaling.

<title>LayerIF: Estimating Layer Quality for Large Language Models using Influence Functions</title>

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance.It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.

<title>Emotion-aware Dual Cross-Attentive Neural Network with Label Fusion for Stance Detection in Misinformative Social Media Content</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has generated an overwhelming volume of user-generated content, conveying implicit opinions and contributing to the spread of misinformation. The method aims to enhance the detection of stance where misinformation can polarize user opinions. Stance detection has emerged as a crucial approach to effectively analyze underlying biases in shared information and combating misinformation. This paper proposes a novel method for \textbf{S}tance \textbf{P}rediction through a \textbf{L}abel-fused dual cross-\textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{E}motion-aware neural \textbf{Net}work (SPLAENet) in misinformative social media user-generated content. The proposed method employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention network to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant parts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We incorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance categories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the texts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align extracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to accurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art methods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\% in accuracy and 17.36\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it achieves average gains of 7.02\% in accuracy and 10.92\% in F1-score. On the P-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\% in accuracy and 11.18\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media content.

<title>Aligning LLMs by Predicting Preferences from User Writing Samples</title>

Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e., Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%. Lastly, we demonstrate that ICL and PROSE are complementary methods, and combining them provides up to a 9\% improvement over ICL alone.

<title>A Course Correction in Steerability Evaluation: Revealing Miscalibration and Side Effects in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23816</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning and instruction-following benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they can reliably produce outputs aligned with a broad variety of user goals, a concept we refer to as steerability. The abundance of methods proposed to modify LLM behavior makes it unclear whether current LLMs are already steerable, or require further intervention. In particular, LLMs may exhibit (i) poor coverage, where rare user goals are underrepresented; (ii) miscalibration, where models overshoot requests; and (iii) side effects, where changes to one dimension of text inadvertently affect others. To systematically evaluate these failures, we introduce a framework based on a multi-dimensional goal space that models user goals and LLM outputs as vectors with dimensions corresponding to text attributes (e.g., reading difficulty). Applied to a text-rewriting task, we find that current LLMs struggle with steerability, as side effects are persistent. Interventions to improve steerability, such as prompt engineering, best-of-$N$ sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, have varying effectiveness, yet side effects remain problematic. Our findings suggest that even strong LLMs struggle with steerability, and existing alignment strategies may be insufficient. We open-source our steerability evaluation framework at https://github.com/MLD3/steerability.

Abstract: Lung sound classification is vital for early diagnosis of respiratory diseases. However, biomedical signals often exhibit inter-patient variability even among patients with the same symptoms, requiring a learning approach that considers individual differences. We propose a Patient-Aware Feature Alignment (PAFA) framework with two novel losses, Patient Cohesion-Separation Loss (PCSL) and Global Patient Alignment Loss (GPAL). PCSL clusters features of the same patient while separating those from other patients to capture patient variability, whereas GPAL draws each patient's centroid toward a global center, preventing feature space fragmentation. Our method achieves outstanding results on the ICBHI dataset with a score of 64.84\% for four-class and 72.08\% for two-class classification. These findings highlight PAFA's ability to capture individualized patterns and demonstrate performance gains in distinct patient clusters, offering broader applications for patient-centered healthcare.

Abstract: Multi-round incomplete information tasks are crucial for evaluating the lateral thinking capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Currently, research primarily relies on multiple benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics to assess these abilities. However, our study reveals novel insights into the limitations of existing methods, as they often yield misleading results that fail to uncover key issues, such as shortcut-taking behaviors, rigid patterns, and premature task termination. These issues obscure the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs and undermine the reliability of evaluations. To address these limitations, we propose a refined set of evaluation standards, including inspection of reasoning paths, diversified assessment metrics, and comparative analyses with human performance.

Abstract: We introduce a method to reduce refusal rates of large language models (LLMs) on sensitive content without modifying model weights or prompts. Motivated by the observation that refusals in certain models were often preceded by the specific token sequence of a token marking the beginning of the chain-of-thought (CoT) block () followed by a double newline token (\n\n), we investigate the impact of two simple formatting adjustments during generation: suppressing \n\n after  and suppressing the end-of-sequence token after the end of the CoT block (). Our method requires no datasets, parameter changes, or training, relying solely on modifying token probabilities during generation. In our experiments with official DeepSeek-R1 distillations, these interventions increased the proportion of substantive answers to sensitive prompts without affecting performance on standard benchmarks. Our findings suggest that refusal behaviors can be circumvented by blocking refusal subspaces at specific points in the generation process.

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a decentralized machine learning approach where multiple clients train a model collaboratively. PPFL preserves privacy and security of the client's data by not exchanging it. However, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for federated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data REadiness) for FL, a novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR) standards, metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. Our framework generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics, rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are optimally prepared for FL while preserving privacy. We demonstrate the framework's practical application by integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across six diverse datasets, addressing seven different DR issues. The results illustrate the framework's versatility and effectiveness in ensuring DR across various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as utilizes valuable resources by identifying and addressing data-related issues before the training phase.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications, robust uncertainty estimation is essential for ensuring the safe and trustworthy deployment of LLMs. We present the most comprehensive study to date of uncertainty estimation in LLMs, evaluating 80 models spanning open- and closed-source families, dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, reasoning and non-reasoning modes, quantization variants and parameter scales from 0.6B to 671B. Focusing on three representative black-box single-pass methods, including token probability-based uncertainty (TPU), numerical verbal uncertainty (NVU), and linguistic verbal uncertainty (LVU), we systematically evaluate uncertainty calibration and selective classification using the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark, which covers both reasoning-intensive and knowledge-based tasks. Our results show that LVU consistently outperforms TPU and NVU, offering stronger calibration and discrimination while being more interpretable. We also find that high accuracy does not imply reliable uncertainty, and that model scale, post-training, reasoning ability and quantization all influence estimation performance. Notably, LLMs exhibit better uncertainty estimates on reasoning tasks than on knowledge-heavy ones, and good calibration does not necessarily translate to effective error ranking. These findings highlight the need for multi-perspective evaluation and position LVU as a practical tool for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world settings.

Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model. Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g., prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose OMNIGUARD, an approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful prompts. OMNIGUARD improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\% over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By repurposing embeddings computed during generation, OMNIGUARD is also very efficient ($\approx 120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline). Code and data are available at: https://github.com/vsahil/OmniGuard.

Abstract: With the increasing brightness of Light sources, including the Diffraction-Limited brightness upgrade of APS and the high-repetition-rate upgrade of LCLS, the proposed experiments therein are becoming increasingly complex. For instance, experiments at LCLS-II-HE will require the X-ray beam to be within a fraction of a micron in diameter, with pointing stability of a few nanoradians, at the end of a kilometer-long electron accelerator, a hundred-meter-long undulator section, and tens of meters long X-ray optics. This enhancement of brightness will increase the data production rate to rival the largest data generators in the world. Without real-time active feedback control and an optimized pipeline to transform measurements to scientific information and insights, researchers will drown in a deluge of mostly useless data, and fail to extract the highly sophisticated insights that the recent brightness upgrades promise.
  In this article, we outline the strategy we are developing at SLAC to implement Machine Learning driven optimization, automation and real-time knowledge extraction from the electron-injector at the start of the electron accelerator, to the multidimensional X-ray optical systems, and till the experimental endstations and the high readout rate, multi-megapixel detectors at LCLS to deliver the design performance to the users. This is illustrated via examples from Accelerator, Optics and End User applications.

<title>A New Deep-learning-Based Approach For mRNA Optimization: High Fidelity, Computation Efficiency, and Multiple Optimization Factors</title>

Abstract: The mRNA optimization is critical for therapeutic and biotechnological applications, since sequence features directly govern protein expression levels and efficacy. However, current methods face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving three key objectives: (1) fidelity (preventing unintended amino acid changes), (2) computational efficiency (speed and scalability), and (3) the scope of optimization variables considered (multi-objective capability). Furthermore, existing methods often fall short of comprehensively incorporating the factors related to the mRNA lifecycle and translation process, including intrinsic mRNA sequence properties, secondary structure, translation elongation kinetics, and tRNA availability. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{RNop}, a novel deep learning-based method for mRNA optimization. We collect a large-scale dataset containing over 3 million sequences and design four specialized loss functions, the GPLoss, CAILoss, tAILoss, and MFELoss, which simultaneously enable explicit control over sequence fidelity while optimizing species-specific codon adaptation, tRNA availability, and desirable mRNA secondary structure features. Then, we demonstrate RNop's effectiveness through extensive in silico and in vivo experiments. RNop ensures high sequence fidelity, achieves significant computational throughput up to 47.32 sequences/s, and yields optimized mRNA sequences resulting in a significant increase in protein expression for functional proteins compared to controls. RNop surpasses current methodologies in both quantitative metrics and experimental validation, enlightening a new dawn for efficient and effective mRNA design. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/HudenJear/RPLoss.

Abstract: A proposition that connects randomness and compression put forward via Gibbs entropy over set of measurement vectors associated with a compression process. The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, so called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appear in iterative fashion and act as smart neural architecture search, Experiments demonstrated utility of this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated so called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy and resource efficient deep learning training approach.

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors, learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space.

Abstract: We propose a method for discovering and visualizing the differences between two learned representations, enabling more direct and interpretable model comparisons. We validate our method, which we call Representational Differences Explanations (RDX), by using it to compare models with known conceptual differences and demonstrate that it recovers meaningful distinctions where existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques fail. Applied to state-of-the-art models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an effective and explainable tool for contrasting model representations.

<title>Lessons Learned: A Multi-Agent Framework for Code LLMs to Learn and Improve</title>

Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.

Abstract: Traditional anti-spoofing focuses on models and datasets built on synthetic speech with mostly neutral state, neglecting diverse emotional variations. As a result, their robustness against high-quality, emotionally expressive synthetic speech is uncertain. We address this by introducing EmoSpoof-TTS, a corpus of emotional text-to-speech samples. Our analysis shows existing anti-spoofing models struggle with emotional synthetic speech, exposing risks of emotion-targeted attacks. Even trained on emotional data, the models underperform due to limited focus on emotional aspect and show performance disparities across emotions. This highlights the need for emotion-focused anti-spoofing paradigm in both dataset and methodology. We propose GEM, a gated ensemble of emotion-specialized models with a speech emotion recognition gating network. GEM performs effectively across all emotions and neutral state, improving defenses against spoofing attacks. We release the EmoSpoof-TTS Dataset: https://emospoof-tts.github.io/Dataset/

Abstract: Reliably monitoring and recognizing maritime vessels based on acoustic signatures is complicated by the variability of different recording scenarios. A robust classification framework must be able to generalize across diverse acoustic environments and variable source-sensor distances. To this end, we present a deep learning model with robust performance across different recording scenarios. Using a trainable spectral front-end and temporal feature encoder to learn a Gabor filterbank, the model can dynamically emphasize different frequency components. Trained on the VTUAD hydrophone recordings from the Strait of Georgia, our model, CATFISH, achieves a state-of-the-art 96.63 % percent test accuracy across varying source-sensor distances, surpassing the previous benchmark by over 12 percentage points. We present the model, justify our architectural choices, analyze the learned Gabor filters, and perform ablation studies on sensor data fusion and attention-based pooling.

Abstract: Cautious predictions -- where a machine learning model abstains when uncertain -- are crucial for limiting harmful errors in safety-critical applications. In this work, we identify a novel threat: a dishonest institution can exploit these mechanisms to discriminate or unjustly deny services under the guise of uncertainty. We demonstrate the practicality of this threat by introducing an uncertainty-inducing attack called Mirage, which deliberately reduces confidence in targeted input regions, thereby covertly disadvantaging specific individuals. At the same time, Mirage maintains high predictive performance across all data points. To counter this threat, we propose Confidential Guardian, a framework that analyzes calibration metrics on a reference dataset to detect artificially suppressed confidence. Additionally, it employs zero-knowledge proofs of verified inference to ensure that reported confidence scores genuinely originate from the deployed model. This prevents the provider from fabricating arbitrary model confidence values while protecting the model's proprietary details. Our results confirm that Confidential Guardian effectively prevents the misuse of cautious predictions, providing verifiable assurances that abstention reflects genuine model uncertainty rather than malicious intent.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are expected to perform effective multimodal reasoning and make logically coherent decisions, which is critical to tasks such as diagram understanding and spatial problem solving. However, current VLM reasoning lacks large-scale and well-structured training datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose VisualSphinx, a first-of-its-kind large-scale synthetic visual logical reasoning training data. To tackle the challenge of image synthesis with grounding answers, we propose a rule-to-image synthesis pipeline, which extracts and expands puzzle rules from seed questions and generates the code of grounding synthesis image synthesis for puzzle sample assembly. Experiments demonstrate that VLM trained using GRPO on VisualSphinx benefit from logical coherence and readability of our dataset and exhibit improved performance on logical reasoning tasks. The enhanced reasoning capabilities developed from VisualSphinx also benefit other reasoning tasks such as algebraic reasoning, arithmetic reasoning and geometry reasoning.

<title>DeepTopoNet: A Framework for Subglacial Topography Estimation on the Greenland Ice Sheets</title>

Abstract: Understanding Greenland's subglacial topography is critical for projecting the future mass loss of the ice sheet and its contribution to global sea-level rise. However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data, particularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet, significantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is traditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice thickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of kilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning framework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice thickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic loss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography, BedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass conservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate high-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively adjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in areas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution of BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates gradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and utilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By systematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\o}m) region, the model achieves high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial terrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging observational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring subglacial topography.

<title>Is Your Model Fairly Certain? Uncertainty-Aware Fairness Evaluation for LLMs</title>

Abstract: The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics, which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g., higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy). To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric, UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark, which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the A2 Copula Spatial Bayesian Neural Network (A2-SBNN), a predictive spatial model designed to map coordinates to continuous fields while capturing both typical spatial patterns and extreme dependencies. By embedding the dual-tail novel Archimedean copula viz. A2 directly into the network's weight initialization, A2-SBNN naturally models complex spatial relationships, including rare co-movements in the data. The model is trained through a calibration-driven process combining Wasserstein loss, moment matching, and correlation penalties to refine predictions and manage uncertainty. Simulation results show that A2-SBNN consistently delivers high accuracy across a wide range of dependency strengths, offering a new, effective solution for spatial data modeling beyond traditional Gaussian-based approaches.

<title>Diversity of Transformer Layers: One Aspect of Parameter Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: Transformers deliver outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and are now a dominant backbone architecture for large language models (LLMs). Their task-solving performance is improved by increasing parameter size, as shown in the recent studies on parameter scaling laws. Although recent mechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the internal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the relationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which mainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first theoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a bias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error of each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which indicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing Transformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when individual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain mutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when individual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce an information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding layers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e., are diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of layers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional layers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the parameter scaling laws. Experiments on multiple semantic-understanding tasks with various LLMs empirically confirm the theoretical properties derived in this study.

Abstract: This paper discusses the construction, fine-tuning, and deployment of BeaverTalk, a cascaded system for speech-to-text translation as part of the IWSLT 2025 simultaneous translation task. The system architecture employs a VAD segmenter for breaking a speech stream into segments, Whisper Large V2 for automatic speech recognition (ASR), and Gemma 3 12B for simultaneous translation. Regarding the simultaneous translation LLM, it is fine-tuned via low-rank adaptors (LoRAs) for a conversational prompting strategy that leverages a single prior-sentence memory bank from the source language as context. The cascaded system participated in the English$\rightarrow$German and English$\rightarrow$Chinese language directions for both the low and high latency regimes. In particular, on the English$\rightarrow$German task, the system achieves a BLEU of 24.64 and 27.83 at a StreamLAAL of 1837.86 and 3343.73, respectively. Then, on the English$\rightarrow$Chinese task, the system achieves a BLEU of 34.07 and 37.23 at a StreamLAAL of 2216.99 and 3521.35, respectively.

Abstract: We have developed an algorithm that constructs a model of a reconfigurable optical interferometer, independent of specific architectural constraints. The programming of unitary transformations on the interferometer's optical modes relies on either an analytical method for deriving the unitary matrix from a set of phase shifts or an optimization routine when such decomposition is not available. Our algorithm employs a supervised learning approach, aligning the interferometer model with a training set derived from the device being studied. A straightforward optimization procedure leverages this trained model to determine the phase shifts of the interferometer with a specific architecture, obtaining the required unitary transformation. This approach enables the effective tuning of interferometers without requiring a precise analytical solution, paving the way for the exploration of new interferometric circuit architectures.

Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models (SSMs) can be merged post-hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by model souping, we propose a strategy where documents are encoded independently and their representations are pooled -- via simple operations like averaging -- into a single context state. This approach, which we call document souping, enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each query. We finetune Mamba2 models to produce soupable representations and find that they support multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning with strong accuracy. On HotpotQA, souping ten independently encoded documents nearly matches the performance of a cross-encoder trained on the same inputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in object detectors have led to their adoption for industrial uses. However, their deployment in critical applications is hindered by the inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal Prediction, a post-hoc procedure which offers statistical guarantees that are valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or data distribution. Our contribution is manifold: first, we formally define the problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD) and introduce a novel method, Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical guarantees of Conformal Risk Control (CRC) to two sequential tasks with two parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we propose loss functions and prediction sets suited to applying CRC to different applications and certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit, enabling replication and further exploration of our methods. Using this toolkit, we perform extensive experiments, yielding a benchmark that validates the investigated methods and emphasizes trade-offs and other practical consequences.

Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$ were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing ferroelectric memories.

Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

Abstract: Calibrating blackbox machine learning models to achieve risk control is crucial to ensure reliable decision-making. A rich line of literature has been studying how to calibrate a model so that its predictions satisfy explicit finite-sample statistical guarantees under a fixed, static, and unknown data-generating distribution. However, prediction-supported decisions may influence the outcome they aim to predict, a phenomenon named performativity of predictions, which is commonly seen in social science and economics. In this paper, we introduce Performative Risk Control, a framework to calibrate models to achieve risk control under performativity with provable theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we provide an iteratively refined calibration process, where we ensure the predictions are improved and risk-controlled throughout the process. We also study different types of risk measures and choices of tail bounds. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by numerical experiments on the task of predicting credit default risk. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to study statistically rigorous risk control under performativity, which will serve as an important safeguard against a wide range of strategic manipulation in decision-making processes.

We introduce a novel methodology that integrates ESNs with transfer learning, aiming to enhance predictive performance across various parameter regimes of the gKS model. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms, assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated, privacy-preserving setting.

Abstract: Given finite-dimensional random vectors $Y$, $X$, and $Z$ that form a Markov chain in that order (i.e., $Y \to X \to Z$), we derive upper bounds on the excess minimum risk using generalized information divergence measures. Here, $Y$ is a target vector to be estimated from an observed feature vector $X$ or its stochastically degraded version $Z$. The excess minimum risk is defined as the difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating $Y$ from $X$ and from $Z$. We present a family of bounds that generalize the mutual information based bound of Gy\"orfi et al. (2023), using the R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon divergences, as well as Sibson's mutual information. Our bounds are similar to those developed by Modak et al. (2021) and Aminian et al. (2024) for the generalization error of learning algorithms. However, unlike these works, our bounds do not require the sub-Gaussian parameter to be constant and therefore apply to a broader class of joint distributions over $Y$, $X$, and $Z$. We also provide numerical examples under both constant and non-constant sub-Gaussianity assumptions, illustrating that our generalized divergence based bounds can be tighter than the one based on mutual information for certain regimes of the parameter $\alpha$.

Abstract: We perform an information-theoretic mode decomposition for separated wakes around a wing. The current data-driven approach based on a neural network referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal structure. We consider three examples of separated flows around a NACA0012 airfoil, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, 2. strong vortex-airfoil interactions, and 3. a turbulent wake in a spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the fluctuation level from their mean values. With the second example of vortex-airfoil interactions, how the effect of vortex gust on a wing emerges in the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of unsteady aerodynamic problems.

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning is a methodology for linking different data modalities; the canonical example is linking image and text data. The methodology is typically framed as the identification of a set of encoders, one for each modality, that align representations within a common latent space. In this work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning as the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional probability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other, consistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal algorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of these conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is similar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.
  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models. This probabilistic perspective suggests two natural generalizations of contrastive learning: the introduction of novel probabilistic loss functions, and the use of alternative metrics for measuring alignment in the common latent space. We study these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate Gaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a low-rank matrix approximation problem. This allows us to characterize the capabilities of loss functions and alignment metrics to approximate natural statistics, such as conditional means and covariances; doing so yields novel variants on contrastive learning algorithms for specific mode-seeking and for generative tasks. The framework we introduce is also studied through numerical experiments on multivariate Gaussians, the labeled MNIST dataset, and on a data assimilation application arising in oceanography.

Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models have proven to be a powerful approach for improved reconstruction of rapid MRI scans. In order to train these models in scenarios where fully-sampled reference data is unavailable, self-supervised learning has gained prominence. However, its application at high acceleration rates frequently introduces artifacts, compromising image fidelity. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel way to train PD-DL networks via carefully-designed perturbations. In particular, we enhance the k-space masking idea of conventional self-supervised learning with a novel consistency term that assesses the model's ability to accurately predict the added perturbations in a sparse domain, leading to more reliable and artifact-free reconstructions. The results obtained from the fastMRI knee and brain datasets show that the proposed training strategy effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification at high acceleration rates, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods both visually and quantitatively.

<title>Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making through neuromorphic hardware, making them compelling for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. Recent studies in this field directly replace Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by SNNs in existing RL frameworks, overlooking whether the RL algorithm is suitable for SNNs. However, most RL algorithms in continuous control are designed tailored to ANNs, including the target network soft updates mechanism, which conflict with the discrete, non-differentiable dynamics of SNN spikes. We identify that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training in continuous control tasks. To bridge this gap between discrete SNN and continuous control, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The continuous and differentiable dynamics of the proxy target enable smooth updates, bypassing the incompatibility of SNN spikes, stabilizing the RL algorithms. Since the proxy network operates only during training, the SNN retains its energy efficiency during deployment without inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that compared to vanilla SNNs, the proxy target framework enables SNNs to achieve up to 32% higher performance across different spiking neurons. Notably, we are the first to surpass ANN performance in continuous control with simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This work motivates a new class of SNN-friendly RL algorithms tailored to SNN's characteristics, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

Abstract: This study proposes a simple yet effective LoRA merge method to achieve LLM adaptation for low-resource language generation tasks. The LoRA merge technique, which integrates multiple LoRA modules trained on different tasks, has gained attention as an effective and efficient approach for adapting LLMs to target tasks. However, previous methods are limited in adaptability as they keep the LoRA parameters frozen. Additionally, the low-resource problem has been out of their scope. We propose a LoRA merge method that updates and prunes LoRA parameters through fine-tuning with minimal target task data, which allows finer-grained adjustments of LoRA parameters and enhancement of task adaptability. Extensive experiments have been conducted taking summarization as a benchmark task. Our datasets cover various domains and multiple languages of English and Japanese. The results confirm that the proposed method achieves significant and consistent improvements in task adaptability over the previous methods.

Abstract: Protein dynamics play a crucial role in protein biological functions and properties, and their traditional study typically relies on time-consuming molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted in silico. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models, have enabled efficient accurate protein structure prediction and conformation sampling by learning distributions over crystallographic structures. However, effectively integrating physical supervision into these data-driven approaches remains challenging, as standard energy-based objectives often lead to intractable optimization. In this paper, we introduce Energy-based Alignment (EBA), a method that aligns generative models with feedback from physical models, efficiently calibrating them to appropriately balance conformational states based on their energy differences. Experimental results on the MD ensemble benchmark demonstrate that EBA achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality protein ensembles. By improving the physical plausibility of generated structures, our approach enhances model predictions and holds promise for applications in structural biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: The diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated the remarkable capability of generating images via learning the noised score function of data distribution. Current DM sampling techniques typically rely on first-order Langevin dynamics at each noise level, with efforts concentrated on refining inter-level denoising strategies. While leveraging additional second-order Hessian geometry to enhance the sampling quality of Langevin is a common practice in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the naive attempts to utilize Hessian geometry in high-dimensional DMs lead to quadratic-complexity computational costs, rendering them non-scalable. In this work, we introduce a novel Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML) method that approximates the diffusion Hessian geometry in a training-free manner, drawing inspiration from the celebrated Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) A low-rank approximation of the diffusion Hessian, leveraging the DMs' inherent structure and circumventing explicit quadratic-complexity computations; (2) A damping mechanism to stabilize the approximated Hessian. This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the diffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image generation quality. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to substantiate the approximation error bound of low-rank approximation and the convergence property of the damping mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple pretrained DMs validate that the LML method significantly improves image generation quality, with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restricts the correctness of MLLMs. However, multimodal hallucinations are multi-sourced and arise from diverse causes. Existing benchmarks fail to adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities; and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns, highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method} establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in original base models.

Abstract: While multi-agent LLM systems show strong capabilities in various domains, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial and low-performing agents. To resolve this issue, in this paper, we introduce a general and adversary-resistant multi-agent LLM framework based on credibility scoring. We model the collaborative query-answering process as an iterative game, where the agents communicate and contribute to a final system output. Our system associates a credibility score that is used when aggregating the team outputs. The credibility scores are learned gradually based on the past contributions of each agent in query answering. Our experiments across multiple tasks and settings demonstrate our system's effectiveness in mitigating adversarial influence and enhancing the resilience of multi-agent cooperation, even in the adversary-majority settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates the flow of factual information in Mamba State-Space Model (SSM)-based language models. We rely on theoretical and empirical connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms. Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured factorization, we disentangle how distinct "features" either enable token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has become an essential machine learning tool for addressing multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been effectively applied across fields such as healthcare, marketing, and biomedical research. However, to enable efficient information sharing across tasks, it is crucial to leverage both shared and heterogeneous information. Despite extensive research on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity, including distribution and posterior heterogeneity, present significant challenges. Existing methods often fail to address these forms of heterogeneity within a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a dual-encoder framework to construct a heterogeneous latent factor space for each task, incorporating a task-shared encoder to capture common information across tasks and a task-specific encoder to preserve unique task characteristics. Additionally, we explore the intrinsic similarity structure of the coefficients corresponding to learned latent factors, allowing for adaptive integration across tasks to manage posterior heterogeneity. We introduce a unified algorithm that alternately learns the task-specific and task-shared encoders and coefficients. In theory, we investigate the excess risk bound for the proposed MTL method using local Rademacher complexity and apply it to a new but related task. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing data integration methods across various settings. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves superior predictive performance for time to tumor doubling across five distinct cancer types in PDX data.

Abstract: Data fusion techniques integrate information from heterogeneous data sources to improve learning, generalization, and decision making across data sciences. In causal inference, these methods leverage rich observational data to improve causal effect estimation, while maintaining the trustworthiness of randomized controlled trials. Existing approaches often relax the strong no unobserved confounding assumption by instead assuming exchangeability of counterfactual outcomes across data sources. However, when both assumptions simultaneously fail - a common scenario in practice - current methods cannot identify or estimate causal effects. We address this limitation by proposing a novel partial identification framework that enables researchers to answer key questions such as: Is the causal effect positive or negative? and How severe must assumption violations be to overturn this conclusion? Our approach introduces interpretable sensitivity parameters that quantify assumption violations and derives corresponding causal effect bounds. We develop doubly robust estimators for these bounds and operationalize breakdown frontier analysis to understand how causal conclusions change as assumption violations increase. We apply our framework to the Project STAR study, which investigates the effect of classroom size on students' third-grade standardized test performance. Our analysis reveals that the Project STAR results are robust to simultaneous violations of key assumptions, both on average and across various subgroups of interest. This strengthens confidence in the study's conclusions despite potential unmeasured biases in the data.

In this paper, we study the convergence of t-SNE with generalized kernels and extend the results of Auffinger and Fletcher in 2023. Our work starts by giving a concrete formulation of generalized input and output kernels. Then we prove that under certain conditions, the t-SNE algorithm converges to an equilibrium distribution for a wide range of input and output kernels as the number of data points diverges.

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) denoising is an important topic in the field of remote sensing. Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising methods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes and lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited interpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient attention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in conventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose a novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network (STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the non-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a sparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by non-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness. Different from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which all regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the advantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and successfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Net and STAR-Net-S outperform state-of-the-art RSI denoising methods.

<title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>

Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While the right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks, an exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through vanilla transformer blocks with self-attention layers, layer normalisation, skip connections and ReLU MLP. To treat the self-attention layer, we draw on a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We identify and characterise two regimes governed by the variance of the query and key initialisations: a low-variance regime, where we recover the known rank collapse behaviour; and a previously unexplored high-variance regime, where signal is preserved but \textit{entropy collapse} occurs. In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the residual connection to ensure signal propagation. Our theory yields trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. Experiments with BERT-style models trained on TinyStories validate our predictions. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantees smooth training.

Abstract: Human to non-human voice conversion (H2NH-VC) transforms human speech into animal or designed vocalizations. Unlike prior studies focused on dog-sounds and 16 or 22.05kHz audio transformation, this work addresses a broader range of non-speech sounds, including natural sounds (lion-roars, birdsongs) and designed voice (synthetic growls). To accomodate generation of diverse non-speech sounds and 44.1kHz high-quality audio transformation, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline and an improved CVAE-based H2NH-VC model, both optimized for human and non-human voices. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed baselines in quality, naturalness, and similarity MOS, achieving effective voice conversion across diverse non-human timbres.

Abstract: Classifying geospatial imagery remains a major bottleneck for applications such as disaster response and land-use monitoring-particularly in regions where annotated data is scarce or unavailable. Existing tools (e.g., RS-CLIP) that claim zero-shot classification capabilities for satellite imagery nonetheless rely on task-specific pretraining and adaptation to reach competitive performance. We introduce GeoVision Labeler (GVL), a strictly zero-shot classification framework: a vision Large Language Model (vLLM) generates rich, human-readable image descriptions, which are then mapped to user-defined classes by a conventional Large Language Model (LLM). This modular, and interpretable pipeline enables flexible image classification for a large range of use cases. We evaluated GVL across three benchmarks-SpaceNet v7, UC Merced, and RESISC45. It achieves up to 93.2% zero-shot accuracy on the binary Buildings vs. No Buildings task on SpaceNet v7. For complex multi-class classification tasks (UC Merced, RESISC45), we implemented a recursive LLM-driven clustering to form meta-classes at successive depths, followed by hierarchical classification-first resolving coarse groups, then finer distinctions-to deliver competitive zero-shot performance. GVL is open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/geo-vision-labeler to catalyze adoption in real-world geospatial workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of information, making them powerful yet raising privacy and safety concerns when selective knowledge removal is required. Existing unlearning strategies, ranging from gradient-based fine-tuning and model editing to sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, either lack interpretability or fail to provide a robust defense against adversarial prompts. We propose SAE-Guided Subspace Projection Unlearning (SSPU), a novel framework that leverages SAE features to drive targeted updates in the model's parameter space, enabling precise, interpretable, and robust unlearning. SSPU's three-stage pipeline performs data-driven layer and feature selection, subspace construction via QR decomposition, and constrained optimization that controls activations into an "irrelevant" subspace while preserving retained knowledge. Overall, we use SAE features to construct a subspace that supervises unlearning, refining the loss and adding a regularization term to guide interpretable parameter updates. In experiments on the WMDP-Cyber forget set and three utility benchmarks (MMLU, TruthfulQA, GSM8K), SSPU reduces harmful knowledge accuracy by 3.22% compared to the strongest baseline. It also improves adversarial robustness, lowering malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts compared to baselines. Our findings expose the limitations of prior unlearning methods and demonstrate how interpretable subspace-guided optimization can achieve robust, controllable model behavior.

Abstract: Oceanographic forecasting impacts various sectors of society by supporting environmental conservation and economic activities. Based on global circulation models, traditional forecasting methods are computationally expensive and slow, limiting their ability to provide rapid forecasts. Recent advances in deep learning offer faster and more accurate predictions, although these data-driven models are often trained with global data from numerical simulations, which may not reflect reality. The emergence of such models presents great potential for improving ocean prediction at a subregional domain. However, their ability to predict fine-scale ocean processes, like mesoscale structures, remains largely unknown. This work aims to adapt a graph neural network initially developed for global weather forecasting to improve subregional ocean prediction, specifically focusing on the Canary Current upwelling system. The model is trained with satellite data and compared to state-of-the-art physical ocean models to assess its performance in capturing ocean dynamics. Our results show that the deep learning model surpasses traditional methods in precision despite some challenges in upwelling areas. It demonstrated superior performance in reducing RMSE errors compared to ConvLSTM and the GLORYS reanalysis, particularly in regions with complex oceanic dynamics such as Cape Ghir, Cape Bojador, and Cape Blanc. The model achieved improvements of up to 26.5% relative to ConvLSTM and error reductions of up to 76% in 5-day forecasts compared to the GLORYS reanalysis at these critical locations, highlighting its enhanced capability to capture spatial variability and improve predictive accuracy in complex areas. These findings suggest the viability of adapting meteorological data-driven models for improving subregional medium-term ocean forecasting.

<title>Diversify and Conquer: Open-set Disagreement for Robust Semi-supervised Learning with Outliers</title>

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) ideally assumes that labeled and unlabeled data share an identical class distribution, however in practice, this assumption is easily violated, as unlabeled data often includes unknown class data, i.e., outliers. The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the context of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that existing open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers and outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be easily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In contrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models that are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables robust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through a single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently biased towards outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we exploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown concepts.

Abstract: We consider a standard distributed optimization problem in which networked nodes collaboratively minimize the sum of their locally known convex costs. For this setting, we address for the first time the fundamental problem of design and analysis of distributed methods to solve the above problem when inter-node communication is subject to \emph{heavy-tailed} noise. Heavy-tailed noise is highly relevant and frequently arises in densely deployed wireless sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we design a distributed gradient-type method that features a carefully balanced mixed time-scale time-varying consensus and gradient contribution step sizes and a bounded nonlinear operator on the consensus update to limit the effect of heavy-tailed noise. Assuming heterogeneous strongly convex local costs with mutually different minimizers that are arbitrarily far apart, we show that the proposed method converges to a neighborhood of the network-wide problem solution in the mean squared error (MSE) sense, and we also characterize the corresponding convergence rate. We further show that the asymptotic MSE can be made arbitrarily small through consensus step-size tuning, possibly at the cost of slowing down the transient error decay. Numerical experiments corroborate our findings and demonstrate the resilience of the proposed method to heavy-tailed (and infinite variance) communication noise. They also show that existing distributed methods, designed for finite-communication-noise-variance settings, fail in the presence of infinite variance noise.

Abstract: Machine translation systems fail when processing code-mixed inputs for low-resource languages. We address this challenge by curating VietMix, a parallel corpus of naturally occurring code-mixed Vietnamese text paired with expert English translations. Augmenting this resource, we developed a complementary synthetic data generation pipeline. This pipeline incorporates filtering mechanisms to ensure syntactic plausibility and pragmatic appropriateness in code-mixing patterns. Experimental validation shows our naturalistic and complementary synthetic data boost models' performance, measured by translation quality estimation scores, of up to 71.84 on COMETkiwi and 81.77 on XCOMET. Triangulating positive results with LLM-based assessments, augmented models are favored over seed fine-tuned counterparts in approximately 49% of judgments (54-56% excluding ties). VietMix and our augmentation methodology advance ecological validity in neural MT evaluations and establish a framework for addressing code-mixed translation challenges across other low-resource pairs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform education, but the research community lacks a robust, general benchmark to evaluate AI models for learning. To assess state-of-the-art support for educational use cases, we ran an "arena for learning" where educators and pedagogy experts conduct blind, head-to-head, multi-turn comparisons of leading AI models. In particular, $N = 189$ educators drew from their experience to role-play realistic learning use cases, interacting with two models sequentially, after which $N = 206$ experts judged which model better supported the user's learning goals. The arena evaluated a slate of state-of-the-art models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and OpenAI o3. Excluding ties, experts preferred Gemini 2.5 Pro in 73.2% of these match-ups -- ranking it first overall in the arena. Gemini 2.5 Pro also demonstrated markedly higher performance across key principles of good pedagogy. Altogether, these results position Gemini 2.5 Pro as a leading model for learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate code-integrated reasoning, where models generate code when necessary and integrate feedback by executing it through a code interpreter. To acquire this capability, models must learn when and how to use external code tools effectively, which is supported by tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) through interactive learning. Despite its benefits, tool-augmented RL can still suffer from potential instability in the learning dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to improving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive experiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and effect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as the extension of model's capability boundaries and the simultaneous improvement of reasoning efficiency through code integration.

<title>Rehearsal with Auxiliary-Informed Sampling for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>

Abstract: The performance of existing audio deepfake detection frameworks degrades when confronted with new deepfake attacks. Rehearsal-based continual learning (CL), which updates models using a limited set of old data samples, helps preserve prior knowledge while incorporating new information. However, existing rehearsal techniques don't effectively capture the diversity of audio characteristics, introducing bias and increasing the risk of forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose Rehearsal with Auxiliary-Informed Sampling (RAIS), a rehearsal-based CL approach for audio deepfake detection. RAIS employs a label generation network to produce auxiliary labels, guiding diverse sample selection for the memory buffer. Extensive experiments show RAIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.953 % across five experiences. The code is available at: https://github.com/falihgoz/RAIS.

Abstract: Developing a general-purpose wearable real-time fall-detection system is still a challenging task, especially for healthy and strong subjects, such as industrial workers that work in harsh environments. In this work, we present a hybrid approach for fall detection and prevention, which uses the dynamic model of an inverted pendulum to generate simulations of falling that are then fed to a deep learning framework. The output is a signal to activate a fall mitigation mechanism when the subject is at risk of harm. The advantage of this approach is that abstracted models can be used to efficiently generate training data for thousands of different subjects with different falling initial conditions, something that is practically impossible with real experiments. This approach is suitable for a specific type of fall, where the subjects fall without changing their initial configuration significantly, and it is the first step toward a general-purpose wearable device, with the aim of reducing fall-associated injuries in industrial environments, which can improve the safety of workers.

<title>Optimal Density Functions for Weighted Convolution in Learning Models</title>

Abstract: The paper introduces the weighted convolution, a novel approach to the convolution for signals defined on regular grids (e.g., 2D images) through the application of an optimal density function to scale the contribution of neighbouring pixels based on their distance from the central pixel. This choice differs from the traditional uniform convolution, which treats all neighbouring pixels equally. Our weighted convolution can be applied to convolutional neural network problems to improve the approximation accuracy. Given a convolutional network, we define a framework to compute the optimal density function through a minimisation model. The framework separates the optimisation of the convolutional kernel weights (using stochastic gradient descent) from the optimisation of the density function (using DIRECT-L). Experimental results on a learning model for an image-to-image task (e.g., image denoising) show that the weighted convolution significantly reduces the loss (up to 53% improvement) and increases the test accuracy compared to standard convolution. While this method increases execution time by 11%, it is robust across several hyperparameters of the learning model. Future work will apply the weighted convolution to real-case 2D and 3D image convolutional learning problems.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale, pre-trained AI systems that have revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision, and are now advancing geospatial analysis and Earth Observation (EO). They promise improved generalization across tasks, scalability, and efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data. However, despite the rapid proliferation of geospatial FMs, their real-world utility and alignment with global sustainability goals remain underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a comprehensive benchmarking framework grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with extremely diverse tasks ranging from asset wealth prediction to environmental hazard detection. This study provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and offers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our findings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform traditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs should go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and energy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable scalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex sustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from model-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics such as energy efficiency, robustness to domain shifts, and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible framework to predict spatially distributed variables with uncertainty. But the use of nonstationary priors, often necessary for capturing complex spatial patterns, makes sampling from the predictive posterior distribution (PPD) computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach based on diffusion generative models (DGMs) to mimic PPDs associated with non-stationary GP priors: we replace the GP prior by a DGM surrogate, and leverage recent advances on training-free guidance algorithms for DGMs to sample from the desired posterior distribution. We apply our approach to a rich non-stationary GP prior from which exact posterior sampling is untractable and validate that the issuing distributions are close to their GP counterpart using several statistical metrics. We also demonstrate how one can fine-tune the trained DGMs to target specific parts of the GP prior. Finally we apply the proposed approach to solve inverse problems arising in environmental sciences, thus yielding state-of-the-art predictions.

Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mixtral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation, late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement" framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness.

Abstract: Objective: Heart failure (HF) patients present with diverse phenotypes affecting treatment and prognosis. This study evaluates models for phenotyping HF patients based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, using structured and unstructured data, assessing performance and interpretability.
  Materials and Methods: The study analyzes all HF hospitalizations at both Amsterdam UMC hospitals (AMC and VUmc) from 2015 to 2023 (33,105 hospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training, and from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included tabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF classes were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results, and textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for testing. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box) models were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured data. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge letters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF classification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from black-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models.
  Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone, achieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for Aug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear explanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc explanations on black-box models.
  Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for phenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while providing clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in transparent clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Predicting startup success requires models that are both accurate and interpretable. We present a lightweight ensemble framework that combines YES/NO questions generated by large language models (LLMs), forming a transparent decision-making system. Each question acts as a weak heuristic, and by filtering, ranking, and aggregating them through a threshold-based voting mechanism, we construct a strong ensemble predictor. On a test set where 10% of startups are classified as successful, our approach achieves a precision rate of 50%, representing a 5x improvement over random selection, while remaining fully transparent. When we incorporate expert-guided heuristics into the generation process, performance improves further to 54% precision. These results highlight the value of combining LLM reasoning with human insight and demonstrate that simple, interpretable ensembles can support high-stakes decisions in domains such as venture capital (VC).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a spectrum of tasks in financial services, including report generation, chatbots, sentiment analysis, regulatory compliance, investment advisory, financial knowledge retrieval, and summarization. However, their intrinsic complexity and lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly regulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and accountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the first application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the inner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the pressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic interpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM behavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the activations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how specific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not only to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore the theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its practical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments, including applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and hallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic interpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs increases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain ethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations. In this paper, we have put special emphasis on how these techniques can help unlock interpretability requirements for regulatory and compliance purposes - addressing both current needs and anticipating future expectations from financial regulators globally.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction models are essential for identifying high-risk individuals and guiding preventive actions. However, existing models struggle with the challenges of real-world clinical practice as they oversimplify patient profiles, rely on rigid input schemas, and are sensitive to distribution shifts. We developed AdaCVD, an adaptable CVD risk prediction framework built on large language models extensively fine-tuned on over half a million participants from the UK Biobank. In benchmark comparisons, AdaCVD surpasses established risk scores and standard machine learning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, for the first time, it addresses key clinical challenges across three dimensions: it flexibly incorporates comprehensive yet variable patient information; it seamlessly integrates both structured data and unstructured text; and it rapidly adapts to new patient populations using minimal additional data. In stratified analyses, it demonstrates robust performance across demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical subgroups, including underrepresented cohorts. AdaCVD offers a promising path toward more flexible, AI-driven clinical decision support tools suited to the realities of heterogeneous and dynamic healthcare environments.

<title>Impact of Bottleneck Layers and Skip Connections on the Generalization of Linear Denoising Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit strong generalization even in highly overparameterized regimes. Significant progress has been made to understand this phenomenon in the context of supervised learning, but for unsupervised tasks such as denoising, several open questions remain. While some recent works have successfully characterized the test error of the linear denoising problem, they are limited to linear models (one-layer network). In this work, we focus on two-layer linear denoising autoencoders trained under gradient flow, incorporating two key ingredients of modern deep learning architectures: A low-dimensional bottleneck layer that effectively enforces a rank constraint on the learned solution, as well as the possibility of a skip connection that bypasses the bottleneck. We derive closed-form expressions for all critical points of this model under product regularization, and in particular describe its global minimizer under the minimum-norm principle. From there, we derive the test risk formula in the overparameterized regime, both for models with and without skip connections. Our analysis reveals two interesting phenomena: Firstly, the bottleneck layer introduces an additional complexity measure akin to the classical bias-variance trade-off -- increasing the bottleneck width reduces bias but introduces variance, and vice versa. Secondly, skip connection can mitigate the variance in denoising autoencoders -- especially when the model is mildly overparameterized. We further analyze the impact of skip connections in denoising autoencoder using random matrix theory and support our claims with numerical evidence.

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have enabled vast improvements in computer vision technologies. Nevertheless, these models are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks which catastrophically impair performance. The physically realizable nature of these attacks calls for certifiable defenses, which feature provable guarantees on robustness. While certifiable defenses have been successfully applied to single-label classification, limited work has been done for multi-label classification. In this work, we present PatchDEMUX, a certifiably robust framework for multi-label classifiers against adversarial patches. Our approach is a generalizable method which can extend any existing certifiable defense for single-label classification; this is done by considering the multi-label classification task as a series of isolated binary classification problems to provably guarantee robustness. Furthermore, in the scenario where an attacker is limited to a single patch we propose an additional certification procedure that can provide tighter robustness bounds. Using the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-label certifiable defense PatchCleanser as a backbone, we find that PatchDEMUX can achieve non-trivial robustness on the MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets while maintaining high clean performance

Abstract: Kernel method-based intensity estimators, formulated within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), and classical kernel intensity estimators (KIEs) have been among the most easy-to-implement and feasible methods for estimating the intensity functions of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. While both approaches share the term "kernel", they are founded on distinct theoretical principles, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized kernel method for Poisson processes based on the least squares loss and show that the resulting intensity estimator involves a specialized variant of the representer theorem: it has the dual coefficient of unity and coincides with classical KIEs. This result provides new theoretical insights into the connection between classical KIEs and kernel method-based intensity estimators, while enabling us to develop an efficient KIE by leveraging advanced techniques from RKHS theory. We refer to the proposed model as the kernel method-based kernel intensity estimator (K$^2$IE). Through experiments on synthetic datasets, we show that K$^2$IE achieves comparable predictive performance while significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimator in computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Knockoff-guided compressive sensing framework, referred to as \TheName{}, which enhances signal recovery by leveraging precise false discovery rate (FDR) control during the support identification phase. Unlike LASSO, which jointly performs support selection and signal estimation without explicit error control, our method guarantees FDR control in finite samples, enabling more reliable identification of the true signal support. By separating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical Knockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction, especially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures recovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\ell_1$-based compressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based method consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art compressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves F1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false discovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also consistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further validate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream predictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often narrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed signals. These results establish \TheName{} as a robust and practical alternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection.

Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn (MESH) technique to refine the OT plan. It begins by selecting genes with high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to capture the most informative features, from which a cost matrix is constructed using cosine distances between cell-type centroids. Importantly, the MESH procedure iteratively refines the cost matrix, leading to a transport plan with significantly enhanced sparsity and interpretability of the resulting correspondence matrices. Applied to retinal bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque, OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus, our framework offers a principled, scalable, symmetric, and interpretable solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into cellular specialization and conservation across species.

Abstract: Diffusion models trained on finite datasets with $N$ samples from a target distribution exhibit a transition from memorisation, where the model reproduces training examples, to generalisation, where it produces novel samples that reflect the underlying data distribution. Understanding this transition is key to characterising the sample efficiency and reliability of generative models, but our theoretical understanding of this transition is incomplete. Here, we analytically study the memorisation-to-generalisation transition in a simple model using linear denoisers, which allow explicit computation of test errors, sampling distributions, and Kullback-Leibler divergences between samples and target distribution. Using these measures, we predict that this transition occurs roughly when $N \asymp d$, the dimension of the inputs. When $N$ is smaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of relevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we demonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent overfitting. For $N > d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalisation in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models and provides insight into the training dynamics of linear denoisers.

<title>Efficient Estimation of Regularized Tyler's M-Estimator Using Approximate LOOCV</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator (RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function; namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an $O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.

<title>AXIOM: Learning to Play Games in Minutes with Expanding Object-Centric Models</title>

Abstract: Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Robot manipulation, especially bimanual manipulation, often requires setting up multiple cameras on multiple robot manipulators. Before robot manipulators can generate motion or even build representations of their environments, the cameras rigidly mounted to the robot need to be calibrated. Camera calibration is a cumbersome process involving collecting a set of images, with each capturing a pre-determined marker. In this work, we introduce the Bi-Manual Joint Calibration and Representation Framework (Bi-JCR). Bi-JCR enables multiple robot manipulators, each with cameras mounted, to circumvent taking images of calibration markers. By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense, marker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the extrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the inter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified, scale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same captured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images captured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame and supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate downstream bimanual coordination tasks. We empirically evaluate the robustness of Bi-JCR on a variety of tabletop environments, and demonstrate its applicability on a variety of downstream tasks.

<title>Vision LLMs Are Bad at Hierarchical Visual Understanding, and LLMs Are the Bottleneck</title>

Abstract: This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy knowledge.

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world, including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset, containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality. Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism. Code, model, and data will be public.

<title>Statistical mechanics of extensive-width Bayesian neural networks near interpolation</title>

Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g., perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms, possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.

Abstract: On-device learning at the edge enables low-latency, private personalization with improved long-term robustness and reduced maintenance costs. Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way 5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots), while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.

Abstract: We study the problem of functional retargeting: learning dexterous manipulation policies to track object states from human hand-object demonstrations. We focus on long-horizon, bimanual tasks with articulated objects, which is challenging due to large action space, spatiotemporal discontinuities, and embodiment gap between human and robot hands. We propose DexMachina, a novel curriculum-based algorithm: the key idea is to use virtual object controllers with decaying strength: an object is first driven automatically towards its target states, such that the policy can gradually learn to take over under motion and contact guidance. We release a simulation benchmark with a diverse set of tasks and dexterous hands, and show that DexMachina significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our algorithm and benchmark enable a functional comparison for hardware designs, and we present key findings informed by quantitative and qualitative results. With the recent surge in dexterous hand development, we hope this work will provide a useful platform for identifying desirable hardware capabilities and lower the barrier for contributing to future research.

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs, benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that $\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged by humans.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Abstract: CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225 CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth, which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance, 93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more robust multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Leveraging sparse networks to connect successive layers in deep neural networks has recently been shown to provide benefits to large-scale state-of-the-art models. However, network connectivity also plays a significant role in the learning performance of shallow networks, such as the classic Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). Efficiently finding sparse connectivity patterns that improve the learning performance of shallow networks is a fundamental problem. While recent principled approaches explicitly include network connections as model parameters that must be optimized, they often rely on explicit penalization or network sparsity as a hyperparameter. This work presents the Network Connectivity Gradients (NCG), an optimization method to find optimal connectivity patterns for RBMs. NCG leverages the idea of network gradients: given a specific connection pattern, it determines the gradient of every possible connection and uses the gradient to drive a continuous connection strength parameter that in turn is used to determine the connection pattern. Thus, learning RBM parameters and learning network connections is truly jointly performed, albeit with different learning rates, and without changes to the model's classic energy-based objective function. The proposed method is applied to the MNIST and other data sets showing that better RBM models are found for the benchmark tasks of sample generation and classification. Results also show that NCG is robust to network initialization and is capable of both adding and removing network connections while learning.

Abstract: Despite dropout's ubiquity in machine learning, its effectiveness as a form of data augmentation remains under-explored. We address two key questions: (i) When is dropout effective as an augmentation strategy? (ii) Is dropout uniquely effective under these conditions? To explore these questions, we propose Deep Augmentation, a network- and modality-agnostic method that applies dropout or PCA transformations to targeted layers in neural networks. Through extensive experiments on contrastive learning tasks in NLP, computer vision, and graph learning, we find that uniformly applying dropout across layers does not consistently improve performance. Instead, dropout proves most beneficial in deeper layers and can be matched by alternative augmentations (e.g., PCA). We also show that a stop-gradient operation is critical for ensuring dropout functions effectively as an augmentation, and that performance trends invert when moving from contrastive tasks to supervised tasks. Our analysis suggests that Deep Augmentation helps mitigate inter-layer co-adaptation -- a notable issue in self-supervised learning due to the absence of labeled data. Drawing on these insights, we outline a procedure for selecting the optimal augmentation layer and demonstrate that Deep Augmentation can outperform traditional input-level augmentations. This simple yet powerful approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of architectures and modalities, yielding notable gains in both performance and generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models are learning pattern-learning systems to model and sample from data distributions with three functional components namely the forward process, the reverse process, and the sampling process. The components of diffusion models have gained significant attention with many design factors being considered in common practice. Existing reviews have primarily focused on higher-level solutions, covering less on the design fundamentals of components. This study seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive and coherent review of seminal designable factors within each functional component of diffusion models. This provides a finer-grained perspective of diffusion models, benefiting future studies in the analysis of individual components, the design factors for different purposes, and the implementation of diffusion models.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) is fundamental to several real-world applications, from logistics and scheduling to hardware design and resource allocation. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown significant benefits in solving CO problems, reducing reliance on domain expertise and improving computational efficiency. However, the absence of a unified benchmarking framework leads to inconsistent evaluations, limits reproducibility, and increases engineering overhead, raising barriers to adoption for new researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce RL4CO, a unified and extensive benchmark with in-depth library coverage of 27 CO problem environments and 23 state-of-the-art baselines. Built on efficient software libraries and best practices in implementation, RL4CO features modularized implementation and flexible configurations of diverse environments, policy architectures, RL algorithms, and utilities with extensive documentation. RL4CO helps researchers build on existing successes while exploring and developing their own designs, facilitating the entire research process by decoupling science from heavy engineering. We finally provide extensive benchmark studies to inspire new insights and future work. RL4CO has already attracted numerous researchers in the community and is open-sourced at https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co.

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains.

Abstract: Handling class imbalance remains a central challenge in machine learning, particularly in pattern recognition tasks where rare but critical events-such as fraudulent transactions or medical anomalies-must be identified accurately. Traditional generative models offer a potential remedy through data augmentation but often treat generation and classification as independent processes, leading to distribution mismatch and limited classifier benefit. To address these shortcomings, we propose Causal Cooperative Networks (CCNETS), a modular learning framework that integrates generation, inference, and reconstruction within a unified causal paradigm. CCNETS comprises three cooperative modules: an Explainer for latent feature abstraction, a Reasoner for label prediction, and a Producer for context-aware data generation. These components interact through a causal feedback loop, where classification results guide targeted sample synthesis. A key innovation, the Zoint mechanism, enables adaptive fusion of latent and observable features, enhancing semantic richness and enabling robust decision-making under uncertainty. We evaluate CCNETS on a real-world credit card fraud detection dataset with extreme imbalance (fraud cases < 0.2%). Across three experimental setups-including synthetic training, amplified generation, and direct classifier comparison-CCNETS outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher F1 scores, precision, and recall. Models trained on CCNETS-generated data also demonstrate superior generalization under limited data conditions. These results establish CCNETS as a scalable, interpretable, and hybrid soft computing framework. By causally aligning synthetic data with classifier objectives, CCNETS advances imbalanced pattern recognition and opens new directions for robust, modular learning in real-world applications.

Abstract: Label smoothing loss is a widely adopted technique to mitigate overfitting in deep neural networks. This paper studies label smoothing from the perspective of Neural Collapse (NC), a powerful empirical and theoretical framework which characterizes model behavior during the terminal phase of training. We first show empirically that models trained with label smoothing converge faster to neural collapse solutions and attain a stronger level of neural collapse. Additionally, we show that at the same level of NC1, models under label smoothing loss exhibit intensified NC2. These findings provide valuable insights into the performance benefits and enhanced model calibration under label smoothing loss. We then leverage the unconstrained feature model to derive closed-form solutions for the global minimizers for both loss functions and further demonstrate that models under label smoothing have a lower conditioning number and, therefore, theoretically converge faster. Our study, combining empirical evidence and theoretical results, not only provides nuanced insights into the differences between label smoothing and cross-entropy losses, but also serves as an example of how the powerful neural collapse framework can be used to improve our understanding of DNNs.

Abstract: Geometric graphs are a special kind of graph with geometric features, which are vital to model many scientific problems. Unlike generic graphs, geometric graphs often exhibit physical symmetries of translations, rotations, and reflections, making them ineffectively processed by current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address this issue, researchers proposed a variety of geometric GNNs equipped with invariant/equivariant properties to better characterize the geometry and topology of geometric graphs. Given the current progress in this field, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive survey of data structures, models, and applications related to geometric GNNs. In this paper, based on the necessary but concise mathematical preliminaries, we formalize geometric graph as the data structure, on top of which we provide a unified view of existing models from the geometric message passing perspective. Additionally, we summarize the applications as well as the related datasets to facilitate later research for methodology development and experimental evaluation. We also discuss the challenges and future potential directions of geometric GNNs at the end of this survey.

Abstract: Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for the widespread adoption of advanced driver assistance system. To match up with each user's preference, the online evolution capability is a must. However, conventional evolution methods learn from naturalistic driving data, which requires a lot computing power and cannot be applied online. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lesson learning approach: learning from driver's takeover interventions. By leveraging online takeover data, the driving zone is generated to ensure perceived safety using Gaussian discriminant analysis. Real-time corrections to trajectory planning rewards are enacted through apprenticeship learning. Guided by the objective of optimizing rewards within the constraints of the driving zone, this approach employs model predictive control for trajectory planning. This lesson learning framework is highlighted for its faster evolution capability, adeptness at experience accumulating, assurance of perceived safety, and computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system consistently achieves a successful customization without further takeover interventions. Accumulated experience yields a 24% enhancement in evolution efficiency. The average number of learning iterations is only 13.8. The average computation time is 0.08 seconds.

Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms (ML) impact virtually every aspect of human lives and have found use across diverse sectors including healthcare, finance, and education. Often, ML algorithms have been found to exacerbate societal biases present in datasets leading to adversarial impacts on subsets/groups of individuals and in many cases on minority groups. To effectively mitigate these untoward effects, it is crucial that disparities/biases are identified early in a ML pipeline. This proactive approach facilitates timely interventions to prevent bias amplification and reduce complexity at later stages of model development. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in usable information theory to introduce DispaRisk, a novel framework designed to proactively assess the potential risks of disparities in datasets during the initial stages of the ML pipeline. We evaluate DispaRisk's effectiveness by benchmarking it against commonly used datasets in fairness research. Our findings demonstrate DispaRisk's capabilities to identify datasets with a high risk of discrimination, detect model families prone to biases within an ML pipeline, and enhance the explainability of these bias risks. This work contributes to the development of fairer ML systems by providing a robust tool for early bias detection and mitigation.

Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear state space models (SSMs) is a challenging task. Existing assimilation methodologies predominantly assume Gaussian posteriors on physical space, where true posteriors become inevitably non-Gaussian. We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear SSMs. DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ in addition to the original physical variables $z_t$ and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on the new latent space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $r(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors remain Gaussian. Notably, the structured design of test distributions enables an analytical formula for the recursive computation, eliminating the accumulation of Monte Carlo sampling errors across time steps. DBF trains the Gaussian inverse observation operators $r(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments demonstrate that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in tasks where the true posterior distribution on physical space is significantly non-Gaussian.

Abstract: We propose a novel deep symbolic regression approach to enhance the robustness and interpretability of data-driven mathematical expression discovery. Our work is aligned with the popular DSR framework which focuses on learning a data-specific expression generator, without relying on pretrained models or additional search or planning procedures. Despite the success of existing DSR methods, they are built on recurrent neural networks, solely guided by data fitness, and potentially meet tail barriers that can zero out the policy gradient, causing inefficient model updates. To overcome these limitations, we design a decoder-only architecture that performs attention in the frequency domain and introduce a dual-indexed position encoding to conduct layer-wise generation. Second, we propose a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based reward function that can automatically adjust the trade-off between expression complexity and data fitness, without the need for explicit manual tuning. Third, we develop a ranking-based weighted policy update method that eliminates the tail barriers and enhances training effectiveness. Extensive benchmarks and systematic experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

<title>A Flexible, Equivariant Framework for Subgraph GNNs via Graph Products and Graph Coarsening</title>

Abstract: Subgraph GNNs enhance message-passing GNNs expressivity by representing graphs as sets of subgraphs, demonstrating impressive performance across various tasks. However, their scalability is hindered by the need to process large numbers of subgraphs. While previous approaches attempted to generate smaller subsets of subgraphs through random or learnable sampling, these methods often yielded suboptimal selections or were limited to small subset sizes, ultimately compromising their effectiveness. This paper introduces a new Subgraph GNN framework to address these issues. Our approach diverges from most previous methods by associating subgraphs with node clusters rather than with individual nodes. We show that the resulting collection of subgraphs can be viewed as the product of coarsened and original graphs, unveiling a new connectivity structure on which we perform generalized message passing.
  Crucially, controlling the coarsening function enables meaningful selection of any number of subgraphs. In addition, we reveal novel permutation symmetries in the resulting node feature tensor, characterize associated linear equivariant layers, and integrate them into our Subgraph GNN. We also introduce novel node marking strategies and provide a theoretical analysis of their expressive power and other key aspects of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple graph learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, as it can seamlessly handle any number of subgraphs, while consistently outperforming baseline approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/Efficient-Subgraph-GNNs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in learning from network-like data but often lack interpretability, making their application challenging in domains requiring transparent decision-making. We propose the Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (GKAN), a novel GNN model leveraging spline-based activation functions on edges to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that GKAN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks. In addition to the improved accuracy, GKAN's design inherently provides clear insights into the model's decision-making process, eliminating the need for post-hoc explainability techniques. This paper discusses the methodology, performance, and interpretability of GKAN, highlighting its potential for applications in domains where interpretability is crucial.

Abstract: Density-based distances (DBDs) provide a principled approach to metric learning by defining distances in terms of the underlying data distribution. By employing a Riemannian metric that increases in regions of low probability density, shortest paths naturally follow the data manifold. Fermat distances, a specific type of DBD, have attractive properties, but existing estimators based on nearest neighbor graphs suffer from poor convergence due to inaccurate density estimates. Moreover, graph-based methods scale poorly to high dimensions, as the proposed geodesics are often insufficiently smooth. We address these challenges in two key ways. First, we learn densities using normalizing flows. Second, we refine geodesics through relaxation, guided by a learned score model. Additionally, we introduce a dimension-adapted Fermat distance that scales intuitively to high dimensions and improves numerical stability. Our work paves the way for the practical use of density-based distances, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: Machine unlearning methods aim to remove sensitive or unwanted content from trained models, but typically demand extensive model updates at significant computational cost while potentially degrading model performance on both related and unrelated tasks. We propose Single Layer Unlearning Gradient (SLUG) as an efficient method to unlearn targeted information by updating a single critical layer using a one-time gradient computation. SLUG uses layer importance and gradient alignment metrics to identify the optimal layer for targeted information removal while preserving the model utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SLUG for CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and vision-language models (VLMs) in removing concrete (e.g., identities and objects) and abstract concepts (e.g., artistic styles). On the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SLUG achieves comparable unlearning performance to existing methods while requiring significantly less computational resources. Our proposed approach offers a practical solution for targeted unlearning that is computationally efficient and precise. Our code is available at https://github.com/CSIPlab/SLUG.

Abstract: Planning is essential for solving complex tasks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying planning in neural networks remain poorly understood. Building on prior work, we analyze a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on Sokoban, a challenging puzzle requiring sequential, irreversible decisions. We find that the RNN has a causal plan representation which predicts its future actions about 50 steps in advance. The quality and length of the represented plan increases over the first few steps. We uncover a surprising behavior: the RNN "paces" in cycles to give itself extra computation at the start of a level, and show that this behavior is incentivized by training. Leveraging these insights, we extend the trained RNN to significantly larger, out-of-distribution Sokoban puzzles, demonstrating robust representations beyond the training regime. We open-source our model and code, and believe the neural network's interesting behavior makes it an excellent model organism to deepen our understanding of learned planning.

Abstract: Transformer-based models excel in various tasks but their generalization capabilities, especially in arithmetic reasoning, remain incompletely understood. Arithmetic tasks provide a controlled framework to explore these capabilities, yet performance anomalies persist, such as inconsistent effectiveness in multiplication and erratic generalization in modular addition (e.g., modulo 100 vs. 101). This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for understanding the generalization behaviors of transformers in arithmetic tasks, focusing on length generalization. Through detailed analysis of addition, multiplication, and modular operations, we reveal that translation invariance in addition aligns with relative positional encoding for robust generalization, while base mismatch in modular operations disrupts this alignment. Experiments across GPT-family models validate our framework, confirming its ability to predict generalization behaviors. Our work highlights the importance of task structure and training data distribution for achieving data-efficient and structure-aware training, providing a systematic approach to understanding of length generalization in transformers.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been a pivotal paradigm for collaborative training of machine learning models across distributed datasets. In heterogeneous settings, it has been observed that a single shared FL model can lead to low local accuracy, motivating personalized FL algorithms. In parallel, fair FL algorithms have been proposed to enforce group fairness on the global models. Again, in heterogeneous settings, global and local fairness do not necessarily align, motivating the recent literature on locally fair FL. In this paper, we propose new FL algorithms for heterogeneous settings, spanning the space between personalized and locally fair FL. Building on existing clustering-based personalized FL methods, we incorporate a new fairness metric into cluster assignment, enabling a tunable balance between local accuracy and fairness. Our methods match or exceed the performance of existing locally fair FL approaches, without explicit fairness intervention. We further demonstrate (numerically and analytically) that personalization alone can improve local fairness and that our methods exploit this alignment when present.

Abstract: Conventional task-specific electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis models require large annotated datasets to train. Foundation models mitigate this burden by leveraging self-supervised pretraining; however, the scarcity of open-weight ECG foundation models hinders adoption and cross-study comparability. We present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a study using a dataset of 1.5 million ECGs. ECG-FM is a transformer-based model pretrained using a hybrid contrastive and generative self-supervised learning approach. Our downstream tasks include predicting reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ECG interpretation labels, where we release a benchmark task on the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset. We affirm that ECG-FM is robust, label-efficient, and functionally discriminative by showcasing data scaling experiments, performing a latent space analysis, and generating saliency maps. ECG-FM markedly outperforms task-specific models in the small-to-medium-scale data regime and demonstrates cross-dataset generalizability, achieving high AUROC on many clinically salient labels such as atrial fibrillation (0.996) and LVEF<=40% (0.929). We release our code, model weights, and benchmark task at https://github.com/bowang-lab/ECG-FM/.

Abstract: Modeling high-order feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, and traditional approaches often predefine a maximum interaction order and rely on exhaustive enumeration of feature combinations up to this predefined order. This framework heavily relies on prior domain knowledge to define interaction scope and entails high computational costs from enumeration. Conventional CTR models face a trade-off between improving representation through complex high-order feature interactions and reducing computational inefficiencies associated with these processes. To address this dual challenge, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented Sparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein). Drawing inspiration from the learnable activation mechanism in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), KarSein leverages this mechanism to adaptively transform low-order basic features into high-order feature interactions, offering a novel approach to feature interaction modeling. KarSein extends the capabilities of KAN by introducing a more efficient architecture that significantly reduces computational costs while accommodating two-dimensional embedding vectors as feature inputs. Furthermore, it overcomes the limitation of KAN's its inability to spontaneously capture multiplicative relationships among features.
  Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of KarSein, demonstrating its ability to surpass not only the vanilla implementation of KAN in CTR predictio but also other baseline methods. Remarkably, KarSein achieves exceptional predictive accuracy while maintaining a highly compact parameter size and minimal computational overhead. As the first attempt to apply KAN in the CTR domain, this work introduces KarSein as a novel solution for modeling complex feature interactions, underscoring its transformative potential in advancing CTR prediction task.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art for training on-device language models for mobile keyboard applications combines federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP) via the DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) algorithm. Two variants of DP-FTRL are used in practice, tree aggregation and matrix factorization. However, tree aggregation suffers from significantly suboptimal privacy/utility tradeoffs, while matrix mechanisms require expensive optimization parameterized by hard-to-estimate-in-advance constants, and high runtime memory costs. This paper extends the recently introduced Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) mechanism to multi-participation scenarios. Our BLT-DP-FTRL maintains the ease-of-use advantages of tree aggregation, while essentially matching matrix factorization in terms of utility and privacy. We evaluate BLT-DP-FTRL on the StackOverflow dataset, serving as a re-producible simulation benchmark, and across four on-device language model tasks in a production FL system. Our empirical results highlight the advantages of the BLT mechanism and elevate the practicality and effectiveness of DP in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Hallucination issues continue to affect multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with existing research mainly addressing object-level or attribute-level hallucinations, neglecting the more complex relation hallucinations that require advanced reasoning. Current benchmarks for relation hallucinations lack detailed evaluation and effective mitigation, and their datasets often suffer from biases due to systematic annotation processes. To address these challenges, we introduce Reefknot, a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples. We provide a systematic definition of relation hallucinations, integrating perceptive and cognitive perspectives, and construct a relation-based corpus using the Visual Genome scene graph dataset. Our comparative evaluation reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs' ability to handle relation hallucinations. Additionally, we propose a novel confidence-based mitigation strategy, which reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 9.75% across three datasets, including Reefknot. Our work offers valuable insights for achieving trustworthy multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proved a promising alternative for conventional local heuristics in score-based approaches to learning directed acyclic causal graphs (DAGs) from observational data. However, the intricate acyclicity constraint still challenges the efficient exploration of the vast space of DAGs in existing methods. In this study, we introduce ALIAS (reinforced dAg Learning wIthout Acyclicity conStraints), a novel approach to causal discovery powered by the RL machinery. Our method features an efficient policy for generating DAGs in just a single step with an optimal quadratic complexity, fueled by a novel parametrization of DAGs that directly translates a continuous space to the space of all DAGs, bypassing the need for explicitly enforcing acyclicity constraints. This approach enables us to navigate the search space more effectively by utilizing policy gradient methods and established scoring functions. In addition, we provide compelling empirical evidence for the strong performance of ALIAS in comparison with state-of-the-arts in causal discovery over increasingly difficult experiment conditions on both synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is automatically improved through additional fine-tuning using extra similar data generated by the service LLM. This multi-turn process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments. Extensive experiments with leading-edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various downstream tasks. Our pipeline implementation is available at https://github.com/deep-diver/llamaduo.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed neural network pruning techniques to reduce the size of a network while preserving robustness against adversarial examples, i.e., well-crafted inputs inducing a misclassification. These methods, which we refer to as adversarial pruning methods, involve complex and articulated designs, making it difficult to analyze the differences and establish a fair and accurate comparison. In this work, we overcome these issues by surveying current adversarial pruning methods and proposing a novel taxonomy to categorize them based on two main dimensions: the pipeline, defining when to prune; and the specifics, defining how to prune. We then highlight the limitations of current empirical analyses and propose a novel, fair evaluation benchmark to address them. We finally conduct an empirical re-evaluation of current adversarial pruning methods and discuss the results, highlighting the shared traits of top-performing adversarial pruning methods, as well as common issues. We welcome contributions in our publicly-available benchmark at https://github.com/pralab/AdversarialPruningBenchmark

Abstract: We establish a unified theoretical framework addressing the stability, consistency, and convergence of neural networks under realistic training conditions, specifically, in the presence of non-IID data, geometric constraints, and embedded physical laws. For standard supervised learning with dependent data, we derive uniform stability bounds for gradient-based methods using mixing coefficients and dynamic learning rates. In federated learning with heterogeneous data and non-Euclidean parameter spaces, we quantify model inconsistency via curvature-aware aggregation and information-theoretic divergence. For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we rigorously prove perturbation stability, residual consistency, Sobolev convergence, energy stability for conservation laws, and convergence under adaptive multi-domain refinements. Each result is grounded in variational analysis, compactness arguments, and universal approximation theorems in Sobolev spaces. Our theoretical guarantees are validated across parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic PDEs, confirming that residual minimization aligns with physical solution accuracy. This work offers a mathematically principled basis for designing robust, generalizable, and physically coherent neural architectures across diverse learning environments.

Abstract: Identifying variables responsible for changes to a biological system enables applications in drug target discovery and cell engineering. Given a pair of observational and interventional datasets, the goal is to isolate the subset of observed variables that were the targets of the intervention. Directly applying causal discovery algorithms is challenging: the data may contain thousands of variables with as few as tens of samples per intervention, and biological systems do not adhere to classical causality assumptions. We propose a causality-inspired approach to address this practical setting. First, we infer noisy causal graphs from the observational and interventional data. Then, we learn to map the differences between these graphs, along with additional statistical features, to sets of variables that were intervened upon. Both modules are jointly trained in a supervised framework, on simulated and real data that reflect the nature of biological interventions. This approach consistently outperforms baselines for perturbation modeling on seven single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We also demonstrate significant improvements over current causal discovery methods for predicting soft and hard intervention targets across a variety of synthetic data.

Abstract: Adapting a pre-trained foundation model on downstream tasks should ensure robustness against distribution shifts without the need to retrain the whole model. Although existing weight interpolation methods are simple yet effective, we argue that their static nature limits downstream performance while achieving efficiency. In this work, we propose DaWin, a training-free dynamic weight interpolation method that leverages the entropy of individual models over each unlabeled test sample to assess model expertise, and compute per-sample interpolation coefficients dynamically. Unlike previous works that typically rely on additional training to learn such coefficients, our approach requires no training. Then, we propose a mixture modeling approach that greatly reduces inference overhead raised by dynamic interpolation. We validate DaWin on the large-scale visual recognition benchmarks, spanning 14 tasks across robust fine-tuning -- ImageNet and derived five distribution shift benchmarks -- and multi-task learning with eight classification tasks. Results demonstrate that DaWin achieves significant performance gain in considered settings, with minimal computational overhead. We further discuss DaWin's analytic behavior to explain its empirical success.

<title>A Generalization Result for Convergence in Learning-to-Optimize</title>

Abstract: Learning-to-optimize leverages machine learning to accelerate optimization algorithms. While empirical results show tremendous improvements compared to classical optimization algorithms, theoretical guarantees are mostly lacking, such that the outcome cannot be reliably assured. Especially, convergence is hardly studied in learning-to-optimize, because conventional convergence guarantees in optimization are based on geometric arguments, which cannot be applied easily to learned algorithms. Thus, we develop a probabilistic framework that resembles classical optimization and allows for transferring geometric arguments into learning-to-optimize. Based on our new proof-strategy, our main theorem is a generalization result for parametric classes of potentially non-smooth, non-convex loss functions and establishes the convergence of learned optimization algorithms to critical points with high probability. This effectively generalizes the results of a worst-case analysis into a probabilistic framework, and frees the design of the learned algorithm from using safeguards.

<title>An Interpretable N-gram Perplexity Threat Model for Large Language Model Jailbreaks</title>

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this, we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

Abstract: The ever-increasing size of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) renders local deployment impractical for individual users. Decentralized computing has emerged as a cost-effective solution, allowing individuals and small companies to perform LLM inference for users using surplus computational power. However, a computing provider may stealthily substitute the requested LLM with a smaller, less capable model without consent from users, thereby benefiting from cost savings. We introduce SVIP, a secret-based verifiable LLM inference protocol. Unlike existing solutions based on cryptographic or game-theoretic techniques, our method is computationally effective and does not rest on strong assumptions. Our protocol requires the computing provider to return both the generated text and processed hidden representations from LLMs. We then train a proxy task on these representations, effectively transforming them into a unique model identifier. With our protocol, users can reliably verify whether the computing provider is acting honestly. A carefully integrated secret mechanism further strengthens its security. We thoroughly analyze our protocol under multiple strong and adaptive adversarial scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SVIP is accurate, generalizable, computationally efficient, and resistant to various attacks. Notably, SVIP achieves false negative rates below 5% and false positive rates below 3%, while requiring less than 0.01 seconds per prompt query for verification.

<title>One-Step is Enough: Sparse Autoencoders for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs) faces significant challenges due to the heavy communication overhead of transmitting large model updates. Although Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed as a solution, yet its application in federated learning is complicated by discordance in aggregation. Existing methods addressing this discordance often suffer from performance degradation at low ranks in heterogeneous data settings. In response, we introduce LoRA-A$^2$ (Low Rank Adaptation with Alternating freeze and Adaptive rank selection), which demonstrates robustness in challenging settings with low ranks and high data heterogeneity. Our experimental findings reveal that LoRA-A$^2$ maintains performance even under extreme heterogeneity and low rank conditions, achieving up to a significant reduction in uploaded parameters compared to full fine-tuning without compromising performance. This adaptive mechanism increases robustness and communication efficiency in federated fine-tuning, enabling the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Quantization is a powerful tool for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, but the accuracy-performance trade-offs across different formats remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct the most comprehensive empirical study to date, evaluating FP8, INT8, and INT4 quantization across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Through over 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1) FP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned INT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\%) accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit quantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for different deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular vLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16 is the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in asynchronous continuous batching. For mixed workloads, the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Our findings offer practical, data-driven guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs at scale -- ensuring the best balance between speed, efficiency, and accuracy.

Abstract: Natural policy gradient (NPG) is a common policy optimization algorithm and can be viewed as mirror ascent in the space of probabilities. Recently, Vaswani et al. [2021] introduced a policy gradient method that corresponds to mirror ascent in the dual space of logits. We refine this algorithm, removing its need for a normalization across actions and analyze the resulting method (referred to as SPMA). For tabular MDPs, we prove that SPMA with a constant step-size matches the linear convergence of NPG and achieves a faster convergence than constant step-size (accelerated) softmax policy gradient. To handle large state-action spaces, we extend SPMA to use a log-linear policy parameterization. Unlike that for NPG, generalizing SPMA to the linear function approximation (FA) setting does not require compatible function approximation. Unlike MDPO, a practical generalization of NPG, SPMA with linear FA only requires solving convex softmax classification problems. We prove that SPMA achieves linear convergence to the neighbourhood of the optimal value function. We extend SPMA to handle non-linear FA and evaluate its empirical performance on the MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that SPMA consistently achieves similar or better performance compared to MDPO, PPO and TRPO.

Abstract: In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/LancelotXWX/SWIFT.

<title>Fixing the Double Penalty in Data-Driven Weather Forecasting Through a Modified Spherical Harmonic Loss Function</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in data-driven weather forecasting models have delivered deterministic models that outperform the leading operational forecast systems based on traditional, physics-based models. However, these data-driven models are typically trained with a mean squared error loss function, which causes smoothing of fine scales through a "double penalty" effect. We develop a simple, parameter-free modification to this loss function that avoids this problem by separating the loss attributable to decorrelation from the loss attributable to spectral amplitude errors. Fine-tuning the GraphCast model with this new loss function results in sharp deterministic weather forecasts, an increase of the model's effective resolution from 1,250km to 160km, improvements to ensemble spread, and improvements to predictions of tropical cyclone strength and surface wind extremes.

Abstract: We introduce Sundial, a family of native, flexible, and scalable time series foundation models. To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative forecasting capability can improve model reliability in real-world decision-making. Code is available at: https://github.com/thuml/Sundial.

Abstract: In principle, explanations are intended as a way to increase trust in machine learning models and are often obligated by regulations. However, many circumstances where these are demanded are adversarial in nature, meaning the involved parties have misaligned interests and are incentivized to manipulate explanations for their purpose. As a result, explainability methods fail to be operational in such settings despite the demand \cite{bordt2022post}. In this paper, we take a step towards operationalizing explanations in adversarial scenarios with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic primitive. Specifically we explore ZKP-amenable versions of the popular explainability algorithm LIME and evaluate their performance on Neural Networks and Random Forests. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/emlaufer/ExpProof.

Abstract: Training safe LLMs remains a critical challenge. The most widely used method, Refusal Training (RT), struggles to generalize against various Out-of-Distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. Although various advanced methods have been proposed to address this issue, we instead question whether OOD attacks inherently surpass the capability of vanilla RT. Evaluations using Best-of-N (BoN) reveal significant safety improvements as N increases, indicating models possess adequate latent safety knowledge but RT fails to consistently elicit it under OOD scenarios. Further domain adaptation analysis reveals that direct RT causes reliance on superficial shortcuts, resulting in non-generalizable representation mappings. Inspired by our findings, we propose training model to perform safety reasoning for each query. Specifically, we synthesize reasoning supervision aligned with specified guidelines that reflect diverse perspectives on safety knowledge. This encourages model to engage in deeper reasoning, explicitly eliciting and utilizing latent safety knowledge for each query. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves model generalization against OOD attacks.

Abstract: Emerging AI accelerators increasingly adopt wafer-scale manufacturing technologies, integrating hundreds of thousands of AI cores in a mesh architecture with large distributed on-chip memory (tens of GB in total) and ultra-high on-chip memory bandwidth (tens of PB/s). However, current LLM inference systems, optimized for shared memory architectures like GPUs, fail to exploit these accelerators fully.
  We introduce WaferLLM, the first wafer-scale LLM inference system. WaferLLM is guided by a novel PLMR model (pronounced as "Plummer") that captures the unique hardware characteristics of wafer-scale architectures. Leveraging this model, WaferLLM pioneers wafer-scale LLM parallelism, optimizing the utilization of hundreds of thousands of on-chip cores. It also introduces MeshGEMM and MeshGEMV, the first GEMM and GEMV implementations designed to scale effectively on wafer-scale accelerators.
  Evaluations show that WaferLLM achieves up to 200$\times$ higher accelerator utilization than state-of-the-art methods. Leveraging a wafer-scale accelerator (Cerebras WSE2), WaferLLM delivers GEMV operations 606$\times$ faster and 16$\times$ more energy-efficient than on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. For full LLM inference, WaferLLM achieves 10-20$\times$ speedups over A100 GPU clusters running SGLang and vLLM. These advantages are expected to grow as wafer-scale AI models, software, and hardware continue to mature. WaferLLM is open-sourced at https://github.com/MeshInfra/WaferLLM.

Abstract: Model merging integrates the weights of multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model. Despite recent interest in the problem, a significant performance gap between the combined and single-task models remains. In this paper, we investigate the key characteristics of task matrices -- weight update matrices applied to a pre-trained model -- that enable effective merging. We show that alignment between singular components of task-specific and merged matrices strongly correlates with performance improvement over the pre-trained model. Based on this, we propose an isotropic merging framework that flattens the singular value spectrum of task matrices, enhances alignment, and reduces the performance gap. Additionally, we incorporate both common and task-specific subspaces to further improve alignment and performance. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision and language tasks across various sets of tasks and model scales. This work advances the understanding of model merging dynamics, offering an effective methodology to merge models without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated PDE-based, inverse problems is a central task in engineering and physics, yet existing neural operator methods struggle with high-dimensional, discontinuous inputs and require large amounts of {\em labeled} training data. We propose the Deep Generative Neural Operator (DGenNO), a physics-aware framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a deep, generative, probabilistic model in combination with a set of lower-dimensional, latent variables that simultaneously encode PDE-inputs and PDE-outputs. This formulation can make use of unlabeled data and significantly improves inverse problem-solving, particularly for discontinuous or discrete-valued input functions. DGenNO enforces physics constraints without labeled data by incorporating as virtual observables, weak-form residuals based on compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs). These relax regularity constraints and eliminate higher-order derivatives from the objective function. We also introduce MultiONet, a novel neural operator architecture, which is a more expressive generalization of the popular DeepONet that significantly enhances the approximating power of the proposed model. These innovations make DGenNO particularly effective for challenging forward and inverse, PDE-based problems, such as those involving multi-phase media. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DGenNO achieves higher accuracy across multiple benchmarks while exhibiting robustness to noise and strong generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Its adaptability, and the ability to handle sparse, noisy data while providing probabilistic estimates, make DGenNO a powerful tool for scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Minority samples are underrepresented instances located in low-density regions of a data manifold, and are valuable in many generative AI applications, such as data augmentation, creative content generation, etc. Unfortunately, existing diffusion-based minority generators often rely on computationally expensive guidance dedicated for minority generation. To address this, here we present a simple yet powerful guidance-free approach called Boost-and-Skip for generating minority samples using diffusion models. The key advantage of our framework requires only two minimal changes to standard generative processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii) timestep skipping. We highlight that these seemingly-trivial modifications are supported by solid theoretical and empirical evidence, thereby effectively promoting emergence of underrepresented minority features. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip greatly enhances the capability of generating minority samples, even rivaling guidance-based state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer computations.

To showcase our framework, we pose these queries to a range of models trained on a range of classification and regression tasks, and receive answers in the form of generated data.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) enhances policies through direct interactions with the environment, but faces challenges related to sample efficiency. In contrast, offline RL leverages extensive pre-collected data to learn policies, but often produces suboptimal results due to limited data coverage. Recent efforts integrate offline and online RL in order to harness the advantages of both approaches. However, effectively combining online and offline RL remains challenging due to issues that include catastrophic forgetting, lack of robustness to data quality and limited sample efficiency in data utilization. In an effort to address these challenges, we introduce A3RL, which incorporates a novel confidence aware Active Advantage Aligned (A3) sampling strategy that dynamically prioritizes data aligned with the policy's evolving needs from both online and offline sources, optimizing policy improvement. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness of our active sampling strategy and conduct diverse empirical experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating that our method outperforms competing online RL techniques that leverage offline data. Our code will be publicly available at:https://github.com/xuefeng-cs/A3RL.

Abstract: Physical reasoning is a remarkable human ability that enables rapid learning and generalization from limited experience. Current AI models, despite extensive training, still struggle to achieve similar generalization, especially in Out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This limitation stems from their inability to abstract core physical principles from observations. A key challenge is developing representations that can efficiently learn and generalize physical dynamics from minimal data. Here we present Neural Force Field (NFF), a framework extending Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to learn complex object interactions through force field representations, which can be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on discrete latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as gravity, support, and collision in continuous explicit force fields. Experiments on three challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF, trained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen scenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient forward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement. Our work suggests that incorporating physics-inspired representations into learning systems can help bridge the gap between artificial and human physical reasoning capabilities.

<title>Can Classic GNNs Be Strong Baselines for Graph-level Tasks? Simple Architectures Meet Excellence</title>

Abstract: Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various domains, with recent advancements in challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, solving reasoning tasks often requires an LLM to generate long sequences, incurring $O(N)$ time and memory complexities per token, where $N$ is the current sequence length. To reduce complexities, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose to retain Key-Value (KV) vectors, the intermediate representations of only the most critical tokens. However, these algorithms struggle with the "impossible trinity" of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art algorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with $O(L)$ time but $O(N)$ memory ($L$ is the cache budget, $L \ll N$). To address the "impossible trinity", in this paper, we identify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks, where milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are utilized, and then become unimportant afterward. Based on this pattern, we propose a new algorithm RaaS that identifies milestone tokens and retains their KV vectors until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time and $O(L)$ memory complexities.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success, but their core components, Transformer layers, are largely heuristics-driven and engineered from the bottom up, calling for a prototypical model with high interpretability and practical competence. To this end, we conceptualize a principled, top-down approach grounded in energy-based interpretation. Specifically, we formalize token dynamics as a joint maximum likelihood estimation on the hypersphere, featuring two properties: semantic alignment in the high-dimensional space and distributional uniformity in the low-dimensional space. By quantifying them with extended Hopfield energy functions, we instantiate this idea as a constrained energy minimization problem, which enables designs of symmetric attention and feedforward modules with RMS normalization. We further present \textit{Hyper-Spherical Energy Transformer} (Hyper-SET), a recurrent-depth alternative to vanilla Transformers naturally emerging from iterative energy optimization on the hypersphere. With shared parameters across layers, Hyper-SET can scale to arbitrary depth with fewer parameters. Theoretically grounded and compact, it achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse tasks, including Sudoku solving, image classification, and masked image modeling. We also design novel variations under the proposed general principle, such as linear attention and gated feedforward layer. Moreover, we showcase its scalability with depth-wise LoRA. Our results highlight Hyper-SET as a step toward interpretable and principled Transformer design.

Abstract: We introduce SWE-Lancer, a benchmark of over 1,400 freelance software engineering tasks from Upwork, valued at \$1 million USD total in real-world payouts. SWE-Lancer encompasses both independent engineering tasks--ranging from \$50 bug fixes to \$32,000 feature implementations--and managerial tasks, where models choose between technical implementation proposals. Independent tasks are graded with end-to-end tests triple-verified by experienced software engineers, while managerial decisions are assessed against the choices of the original hired engineering managers. We evaluate model performance and find that frontier models are still unable to solve the majority of tasks. To facilitate future research, we open-source a unified Docker image and a public evaluation split, SWE-Lancer Diamond (https://github.com/openai/SWELancer-Benchmark). By mapping model performance to monetary value, we hope SWE-Lancer enables greater research into the economic impact of AI model development.

Abstract: We present a novel reasoning approach called Flow-of-Options (FoO), designed to address intrinsic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). Flow-of-Options enables LLMs to systematically explore a diverse range of possibilities in their reasoning, as demonstrated by an FoO-based agentic framework developed for autonomously solving Machine Learning (ML) tasks. FoO enforces diversity in LLM solutions through compressed and interpretable task representations, resulting in improvements of 38.2% - 69.2% on standard data science tasks, and 37.4% - 47.9% on therapeutic chemistry tasks, as compared to state-of-the-art baselines. With an overall operation cost under $1 per task, our framework is well-suited for cost-sensitive applications. Going beyond tabular classification and regression, we show the broader applicability of our FoO-based agentic system to tasks such as reinforcement learning and image generation. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flagshippioneering/Flow-of-Options.

Abstract: Understanding how effectively large vision language models (VLMs) compare visual inputs is crucial across numerous applications, yet this fundamental capability remains insufficiently assessed. While VLMs are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring comparative judgment, including automated evaluation, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation, no systematic framework exists to measure their performance in these scenarios. We present PairBench, a simple framework that evaluates VLMs as customizable similarity tools using widely available image datasets. Our approach introduces four key metrics for reliable comparison: alignment with human annotations, consistency across pair ordering, distribution smoothness, and controllability through prompting. Our analysis reveals that no model consistently excels across all metrics, with each demonstrating distinct strengths and weaknesses. Most concerning is the widespread inability of VLMs to maintain symmetric similarity scores. Interestingly, we demonstrate that performance on our benchmark strongly correlates with popular benchmarks used for more complex tasks, while providing additional metrics into controllability, smoothness and ordering. This makes PairBench a unique and comprehensive framework to evaluate the performance of VLMs for automatic evaluation depending on the task.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models still fall short of human visual cognition. In an effort to improve visual cognition and align models with human behavior, we introduce visual stimuli and human judgments on visual cognition tasks, allowing us to systematically evaluate performance across cognitive domains under a consistent environment. We fine-tune models on ground truth data for intuitive physics and causal reasoning and find that this improves model performance in the respective fine-tuning domain. Furthermore, it can improve model alignment with human behavior. However, we find that task-specific fine-tuning does not contribute to robust human-like generalization to data with other visual characteristics or to tasks in other cognitive domains.

<title>Adaptive Conformal Guidance: A Framework for Multi-Domain Learning under Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning domains. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose $\underline{Ada}$ptive $\underline{Con}$formal $\underline{G}$uidance (AdaConG), a universal, plug-and-play framework that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse domains and tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a simple yet effective solution for multi-domain learning under uncertainty.

Abstract: A tenet of reinforcement learning is that the agent always observes rewards. However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer may not always be available to provide rewards, sensors may be limited or malfunctioning, or rewards may be inaccessible during deployment. Monitored Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed to model such settings. However, existing Mon-MDP algorithms have several limitations: they do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot leverage a known monitor, lack worst-case guarantees for 'unsolvable' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm employs two instances of model-based interval estimation: one to ensure that observable rewards are reliably captured, and another to learn the minimax-optimal policy. Second, we empirically demonstrate the advantages. We show faster convergence than prior algorithms in over four dozen benchmarks, and even more dramatic improvement when the monitoring process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance. We show convergence to a minimax-optimal policy even when some rewards are never observable.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the necessity of traceability for accurate learning in stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under $\ell_p$ geometries. Informally, we say a learning algorithm is $m$-traceable if, by analyzing its output, it is possible to identify at least $m$ of its training samples. Our main results uncover a fundamental tradeoff between traceability and excess risk in SCO. For every $p\in [1,\infty)$, we establish the existence of an excess risk threshold below which every sample-efficient learner is traceable with the number of samples which is a constant fraction of its training sample. For $p\in [1,2]$, this threshold coincides with the best excess risk of differentially private (DP) algorithms, i.e., above this threshold, there exist algorithms that are not traceable, which corresponds to a sharp phase transition. For $p \in (2,\infty)$, this threshold instead gives novel lower bounds for DP learning, partially closing an open problem in this setup. En route to establishing these results, we prove a sparse variant of the fingerprinting lemma, which is of independent interest to the community.

<title>Recurrent Knowledge Identification and Fusion for Language Model Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) in dynamic real-world environments without costly retraining. While recent model ensemble and model merging methods guided by parameter importance have gained popularity, they often struggle to balance knowledge transfer and forgetting, mainly due to the reliance on static importance estimates during sequential training. In this paper, we present Recurrent-KIF, a novel CL framework for Recurrent Knowledge Identification and Fusion, which enables dynamic estimation of parameter importance distributions to enhance knowledge transfer. Inspired by human continual learning, Recurrent-KIF employs an inner loop that rapidly adapts to new tasks while identifying important parameters, coupled with an outer loop that globally manages the fusion of new and historical knowledge through redundant knowledge pruning and key knowledge merging. These inner-outer loops iteratively perform multiple rounds of fusion, allowing Recurrent-KIF to leverage intermediate training information and adaptively adjust fusion strategies based on evolving importance distributions. Extensive experiments on two CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that Recurrent-KIF effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances knowledge transfer.

Abstract: In this study, we propose an innovative dynamic classification algorithm aimed at achieving zero missed detections and minimal false positives,acritical in safety-critical domains (e.g., medical diagnostics) where undetected cases risk severe outcomes. The algorithm partitions data in a self-supervised learning-generated way, which allows the model to learn from the training set to understand the data distribution and thereby divides training set and test set into N different subareas. The training and test subsets in the same subarea will have nearly the same boundary. For each subarea, there will be the same type of model, such as linear or random forest model, to predict the results of that subareas. In addition, the algorithm uses subareas boundary to refine predictions results and filter out substandard results without requiring additional models. This approach allows each model to operate within a smaller data range and remove the inaccurate prediction results, thereby improving overall accuracy. Experimental results show that, with minimal data partitioning errors, the algorithm achieves exceptional performance with zero missed detections and minimal false positives, outperforming existing ensembles like XGBoost or LGBM model. Even with larger classification errors, it remains comparable to that of state-of-the-art models.
  Key innovations include self-supervised classification learning, small-range subset predictions, and optimizing the prediction results and eliminate the unqualified ones without the need for additional model support. Although the algorithm still has room for improvement in automatic parameter tuning and efficiency, it demonstrates outstanding performance across multiple datasets. Future work will focus on optimizing the classification components to enhance robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that conduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal insider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate rich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year financial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We analyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two pronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy) non-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in Graph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large percentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden fraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and compromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage Learning (${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to mitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations. The proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness against hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the importance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$ over a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: This paper introduces the SOAR framework for imitation learning. SOAR is an algorithmic template that learns a policy from expert demonstrations with a primal dual style algorithm that alternates cost and policy updates. Within the policy updates, the SOAR framework uses an actor critic method with multiple critics to estimate the critic uncertainty and build an optimistic critic fundamental to drive exploration. When instantiated in the tabular setting, we get a provable algorithm with guarantees that matches the best known results in $\epsilon$. Practically, the SOAR template is shown to boost consistently the performance of imitation learning algorithms based on Soft Actor Critic such as f-IRL, ML-IRL and CSIL in several MuJoCo environments. Overall, thanks to SOAR, the required number of episodes to achieve the same performance is reduced by half.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: This paper poses two critical issues in evaluating base models (without post-training): (1) Unstable evaluation during training: in the early stages of pre-training, the models lack the capability to answer questions as required, leading to unstable evaluation results. This instability makes it difficult to provide solid conclusions to guide the training, especially for key experiments such as data ablation and scaling law. (2) Inconsistency between base and instruct models: base models generally exhibit poorer evaluation performance compared to corresponding instruct models. This gap poses a challenge for assessing whether a base model with better evaluation can truly lead to a better instruct model. To address these issues, we propose Base model Oriented Systematic Evaluation (BOSE), a method specifically designed to optimize the evaluation of base models. Specifically, BOSE introduces two key innovations: In-Context Light-instruction Prompt (ICLiP) for open-ended tasks and Blank-ppl for multi-choice tasks with candidate options, which transforms the standard perplexity (ppl) metric into a fill-in-the-blank format to mitigate early-stage evaluation fluctuations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose Kendall's rank correlation to quantitatively measure the evaluation stability and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that BOSE significantly enhances both the stability of evaluations during pre-training and the consistency between base and instruct models, thereby providing more reliable guidance for the LLMs' training.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can predict energy, force, and stress of materials and enable a wide range of downstream discovery tasks. A key design choice in MLIPs involves the trade-off between invariant and equivariant architectures. Invariant models offer computational efficiency but may not perform as well, especially when predicting high-order outputs. In contrast, equivariant models can capture high-order symmetries, but are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose HIENet, a hybrid invariant-equivariant materials interatomic potential model that integrates both invariant and equivariant message passing layers, while provably satisfying key physical constraints. HIENet achieves state-of-the-art performance with considerable computational speedups over prior models. Experimental results on both common benchmarks and downstream materials discovery tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HIENet.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, while maintaining long-term coverage and achieving sub-linear regret. IM-OCP features closed-form updates with minimal memory complexity, and is designed to operate under potentially intermittent feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content, posing significant challenges for applications where factuality is crucial. While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sentence-level sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35.5% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only a 10.6% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content. Additionally, we contribute a new dataset for evaluating sampling-based methods - FavaMultiSamples.

Abstract: Many high-impact machine learning tasks involve multi-dimensional data such as images, volumetric medical scans, and multivariate time-series. Yet, most neural architectures flatten these inputs, discarding critical cross-dimension information. We introduce $\textbf{NdLinear}$, a novel linear transformation that circumvents this destructive flattening by operating directly on tensors. NdLinear applies transformations separately along each data dimension, thereby preserving the native data structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity to significantly enhance representational power, achieve dramatic parameter reductions (often by orders of magnitude), and maintain a favorable computational profile. For instance, when applied to Large Language Model finetuning, our $\textbf{NdLinear-LoRA}$ delivers comparable or improved accuracy on reasoning tasks using up to $9\times$ fewer trainable parameters than standard LoRA. These broad advantages of NdLinear are consistently validated across diverse neural architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, MLPs) and data domains, including vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks. As a versatile, drop-in replacement for standard linear layers, NdLinear processes data in its original N-dimensional form, offering a foundational component for developing more efficient and powerful next-generation neural architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability in solving mathematical problems. However, existing approaches primarily focus on improving the quality of correct training data, e.g., distilling high-quality correct solutions from advanced models, neglecting the value contained in error data, potentially hindering the model's reflective ability. Though some studies attempt to leverage error data, they often involve complex mechanisms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore error nodes. In this work, we propose to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability by Learning from Errors for Mathematical Advancement (LEMMA). LEMMA constructs data consisting of an incorrect solution with an erroneous step and a reflection connection to a correct solution for fine-tuning. Specifically, we systematically analyze the model-generated error types and introduce an error-type grounded mistake augmentation method to collect diverse and representative errors. Correct solutions are either from fixing the errors or generating a fresh start. Through a model-aware smooth reflection connection, the erroneous solution is transferred to the correct one. By fine-tuning on the constructed dataset, the model is able to self-correct errors autonomously within the generation process without relying on external critique models. Experimental results demonstrate that LEMMA achieves significant performance improvements over other strong baselines.

Abstract: Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's representations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are introduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to interpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that learns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent directions in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how concepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed concepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that these model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning. However, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training loss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these issues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In experiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the standard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these insights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it substantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and highly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar techniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of chat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective, representing concepts such as $\textit{false information}$ and $\textit{personal question}$, along with multiple refusal-related latents that show nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work advances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing and demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning modifies model behavior.

Abstract: Modelling bounded rational decision-making through information constrained processing provides a principled approach for representing departures from rationality within a reinforcement learning framework, while still treating decision-making as an optimization process. However, existing approaches are generally based on Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or Mutual Information. In this work, we highlight issues with these approaches when dealing with ordinal action spaces. Specifically, entropy assumes uniform prior beliefs, missing the impact of a priori biases on decision-makings. KL-Divergence addresses this, however, has no notion of "nearness" of actions, and additionally, has several well known potentially undesirable properties such as the lack of symmetry, and furthermore, requires the distributions to have the same support (e.g. positive probability for all actions). Mutual information is often difficult to estimate. Here, we propose an alternative approach for modeling bounded rational RL agents utilising Wasserstein distances. This approach overcomes the aforementioned issues. Crucially, this approach accounts for the nearness of ordinal actions, modeling "stickiness" in agent decisions and unlikeliness of rapidly switching to far away actions, while also supporting low probability actions, zero-support prior distributions, and is simple to calculate directly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.

<title>Analysis of Pseudo-Labeling for Online Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: A domain (distribution) shift between training and test data often hinders the real-world performance of deep neural networks, necessitating unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to bridge this gap. Online source-free UDA has emerged as a solution for practical scenarios where access to source data is restricted and target data is received as a continuous stream. However, the open-world nature of many real-world applications additionally introduces category shifts meaning that the source and target label spaces may differ. Online source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing methods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship between pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled experiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into pseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap between the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved with perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables effective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a cross-entropy (CE) loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves superior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection. Lastly, our findings indicate that pseudo-label accuracy is in general more crucial than quantity, suggesting that prioritizing fewer but high-confidence pseudo-labels is beneficial. Overall, our study highlights the critical role of pseudo-labeling in (online) SF-UniDA and provides actionable insights to drive future advancements in the field.

Abstract: We study the robustness of Transformer language models under semantic out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, where training and test data lie in disjoint latent spaces. Using Wasserstein-1 distance and Gevrey-class smoothness, we derive sub-exponential upper bounds on prediction error. Our theoretical framework explains how smoothness governs generalization under distributional drift. We validate these findings through controlled experiments on arithmetic and Chain-of-Thought tasks with latent permutations and scalings. Results show empirical degradation aligns with our bounds, highlighting the geometric and functional principles underlying OOD generalization in Transformers.

Abstract: We introduce softpick, a rectified, not sum-to-one, drop-in replacement for softmax in transformer attention mechanisms that eliminates attention sink and massive activations. Our experiments with 340M and 1.8B parameter models demonstrate that softpick achieves 0\% sink rate consistently. The softpick transformers produce hidden states with significantly lower kurtosis and creates sparse attention maps. Quantized models using softpick outperform softmax on standard benchmarks, with a particularly pronounced advantage at lower bit precisions. Our analysis and discussion shows how softpick has the potential to open new possibilities for quantization, low-precision training, sparsity optimization, pruning, and interpretability.

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We investigate Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a partial information setting where examples in a training set are grouped into bags, and only aggregate label values in each bag are available. Despite the partial observability, the goal is still to achieve small regret at the level of individual examples. We give results on the sample complexity of LLP under square loss, showing that our sample complexity is essentially optimal. From an algorithmic viewpoint, we rely on carefully designed variants of Empirical Risk Minimization, and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, combined with ad hoc variance reduction techniques. On one hand, our theoretical results improve in important ways on the existing literature on LLP, specifically in the way the sample complexity depends on the bag size. On the other hand, we validate our algorithmic solutions on several datasets, demonstrating improved empirical performance (better accuracy for less samples) against recent baselines.

Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.

<title>Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?</title>

Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/Little0o0/Quaff.git.

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts. Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: De novo peptide sequencing is a critical task in proteomics. However, the performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs a list-wise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (Peptide Mass Deviation) and RMD (residual Mass Deviation), which offer delicate supervision by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only surpasses its base models used to generate training candidates for reranking pre-training, but also sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Moreover, RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen models whose generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and potential as a universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work presents a novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo sequencing. Our source code is provided on GitHub.

Abstract: In an increasing number of applications designers have access to multiple computer models which typically have different levels of fidelity and cost. Traditionally, designers calibrate these models one at a time against some high-fidelity data (e.g., experiments). In this paper, we question this tradition and assess the potential of calibrating multiple computer models at the same time. To this end, we develop a probabilistic framework that is founded on customized neural networks (NNs) that are designed to calibrate an arbitrary number of computer models. In our approach, we (1) consider the fact that most computer models are multi-response and that the number and nature of calibration parameters may change across the models, and (2) learn a unique probability distribution for each calibration parameter of each computer model, (3) develop a loss function that enables our NN to emulate all data sources while calibrating the computer models, and (4) aim to learn a visualizable latent space where model-form errors can be identified. We test the performance of our approach on analytic and engineering problems to understand the potential advantages and pitfalls in simultaneous calibration of multiple computer models. Our method can improve predictive accuracy, however, it is prone to non-identifiability issues in higher-dimensional input spaces that are normally constrained by underlying physics.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA (HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0 absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12 benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.

Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

Abstract: Several causal parameters in short panel data models are functionals of a nested nonparametric instrumental variable regression (nested NPIV). Recent examples include mediated, time varying, and long term treatment effects identified using proxy variables. In econometrics, examples arise in triangular simultaneous equations and hedonic price systems. However, it appears that explicit mean square convergence rates for nested NPIV are unknown, preventing inference on some of these parameters with generic machine learning. A major challenge is compounding ill posedness due to the nested inverse problems. To limit how ill posedness compounds, we introduce two techniques: relative well posedness, and multiple robustness to ill posedness. With these techniques, we provide explicit mean square rates for nested NPIV and efficient inference for recently identified causal parameters. Our nonasymptotic analysis accommodates neural networks, random forests, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. It extends to causal functions, e.g. heterogeneous long term treatment effects.

Abstract: Many peer-review venues are using algorithms to assign submissions to reviewers. The crux of such automated approaches is the notion of the "similarity score" -- a numerical estimate of the expertise of a reviewer in reviewing a paper -- and many algorithms have been proposed to compute these scores. However, these algorithms have not been subjected to a principled comparison, making it difficult for stakeholders to choose the algorithm in an evidence-based manner. The key challenge in comparing existing algorithms and developing better algorithms is the lack of publicly available gold-standard data. We address this challenge by collecting a novel dataset of similarity scores that we release to the research community. Our dataset consists of 477 self-reported expertise scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their expertise in reviewing papers they have read previously.
  Using our dataset, we compare several widely used similarity algorithms and offer key insights. First, all algorithms exhibit significant error, with misranking rates between 12%-30% in easier cases and 36%-43% in harder ones. Second, most specialized algorithms are designed to work with titles and abstracts of papers, and in this regime the SPECTER2 algorithm performs best. Interestingly, classical TF-IDF matches SPECTER2 in accuracy when given access to full submission texts. In contrast, off-the-shelf LLMs lag behind specialized approaches.

<title>Near-Optimal Nonconvex-Strongly-Convex Bilevel Optimization with Fully First-Order Oracles</title>

Abstract: In this work, we consider bilevel optimization when the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent works show that with a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle, one can provably find an $\epsilon$-stationary point within ${\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls. However, the HVP oracle may be inaccessible or expensive in practice. Kwon et al. (ICML 2023) addressed this issue by proposing a first-order method that can achieve the same goal at a slower rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$. In this paper, we incorporate a two-time-scale update to improve their method to achieve the near-optimal $\tilde {\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ first-order oracle complexity. Our analysis is highly extensible. In the stochastic setting, our algorithm can achieve the stochastic first-order oracle complexity of $\tilde {\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ and $\tilde {\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ when the stochastic noises are only in the upper-level objective and in both level objectives, respectively. When the objectives have higher-order smoothness conditions, our deterministic method can escape saddle points by injecting noise, and can be accelerated to achieve a faster rate of $\tilde {\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.75})$ using Nesterov's momentum.

<title>Nonparametric Additive Value Functions: Interpretable Reinforcement Learning with an Application to Surgical Recovery</title>

Abstract: We propose a nonparametric additive model for estimating interpretable value functions in reinforcement learning, with an application in optimizing postoperative recovery through personalized, adaptive recommendations. While reinforcement learning has achieved significant success in various domains, recent methods often rely on black-box approaches such as neural networks, which hinder the examination of individual feature contributions to a decision-making policy. Our novel method offers a flexible technique for estimating action-value functions without explicit parametric assumptions, overcoming the limitations of the linearity assumption of classical algorithms. By incorporating local kernel regression and basis expansion, we obtain a sparse, additive representation of the action-value function, enabling local approximation and retrieval of nonlinear, independent contributions of select state features and the interactions between joint feature pairs. We validate our approach through a simulation study and apply it to spine disease recovery, uncovering recommendations aligned with clinical knowledge. This method bridges the gap between flexible machine learning techniques and the interpretability required in healthcare applications, paving the way for more personalized interventions.

<title>From the Pursuit of Universal AGI Architecture to Systematic Approach to Heterogenous AGI: Addressing Alignment, Energy, &amp; AGI Grand Challenges</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) faces a trifecta of grand challenges: the Energy Wall, the Alignment Problem and the Leap from Narrow AI to AGI. We present SAGI, a Systematic Approach to AGI that utilizes system design principles to overcome the energy wall and alignment challenges. This paper asserts that AGI can be realized through multiplicity of design specific pathways and customized through system design rather than a singular overarching architecture. AGI systems may exhibit diver architectural configurations and capabilities, contingent upon their intended use cases. Alignment, a challenge broadly recognized as AIs most formidable, is the one that depends most critically on system design and serves as its primary driving force as a foundational criterion for AGI. Capturing the complexities of human morality for alignment requires architectural support to represent the intricacies of moral decision-making and the pervasive ethical processing at every level, with performance reliability exceeding that of human moral judgment. Hence, requiring a more robust architecture towards safety and alignment goals, without replicating or resembling the human brain.
  We argue that system design (such as feedback loops, energy and performance optimization) on learning substrates (capable of learning its system architecture) is more fundamental to achieving AGI goals and guarantees, superseding classical symbolic, emergentist and hybrid approaches. Through learning of the system architecture itself, the resulting AGI is not a product of spontaneous emergence but of systematic design and deliberate engineering, with core features, including an integrated moral architecture, deeply embedded within its architecture. The approach aims to guarantee design goals such as alignment, efficiency by self-learning system architecture.

<title>GNNBleed: Inference Attacks to Unveil Private Edges in Graphs with Realistic Access to GNN Models</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become indispensable tools for learning from graph structured data, catering to various applications such as social network analysis and fraud detection for financial services. At the heart of these networks are the edges, which are crucial in guiding GNN models' predictions. In many scenarios, these edges represent sensitive information, such as personal associations or financial dealings, which require privacy assurance. However, their contributions to GNN model predictions may, in turn, be exploited by the adversary to compromise their privacy. Motivated by these conflicting requirements, this paper investigates edge privacy in contexts where adversaries possess only black-box access to the target GNN model, restricted further by access controls, preventing direct insights into arbitrary node outputs. Moreover, we are the first to extensively examine situations where the target graph continuously evolves, a common trait of many real-world graphs. In this setting, we present a range of attacks that leverage the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our attacks using nine real-world datasets, encompassing both static and dynamic graphs, across four different GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing methods across various GNN architectures, consistently achieving an F1 score of at least 0.8 in static scenarios. Furthermore, our attack retains robustness in dynamic graph scenarios, maintaining F1 scores up to 0.8, unlike previous methods that only achieve F1 scores around 0.2.

arXiv:2312.02849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of finite-dimensional polyhedral subsets over the Wasserstein space and optimization of functionals over them via first-order methods. Our main application is to the problem of mean-field variational inference, which seeks to approximate a distribution $\pi$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a product measure $\pi^\star$. When $\pi$ is strongly log-concave and log-smooth, we provide (1) approximation rates certifying that $\pi^\star$ is close to the minimizer $\pi^\star_\diamond$ of the KL divergence over a \emph{polyhedral} set $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$, and (2) an algorithm for minimizing $\text{KL}(\cdot\|\pi)$ over $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$ based on accelerated gradient descent over $\R^d$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first end-to-end analysis for gradient-based algorithms for MFVI.

<title>(Accelerated) Noise-adaptive Stochastic Heavy-Ball Momentum</title>

Abstract: Stochastic heavy ball momentum (SHB) is commonly used to train machine learning models, and often provides empirical improvements over stochastic gradient descent. By primarily focusing on strongly-convex quadratics, we aim to better understand the theoretical advantage of SHB and subsequently improve the method. For strongly-convex quadratics, Kidambi et al. (2018) show that SHB (with a mini-batch of size $1$) cannot attain accelerated convergence, and hence has no theoretical benefit over SGD. They conjecture that the practical gain of SHB is a by-product of using larger mini-batches. We first substantiate this claim by showing that SHB can attain an accelerated rate when the mini-batch size is larger than a threshold $b^*$ that depends on the condition number $\kappa$. Specifically, we prove that with the same step-size and momentum parameters as in the deterministic setting, SHB with a sufficiently large mini-batch size results in an $O\left(\exp(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}}) + \sigma \right)$ convergence when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the $\ell_2$ norm, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $\sigma^2$ is the variance in the stochastic gradients. We prove a lower-bound which demonstrates that a $\kappa$ dependence in $b^*$ is necessary. To ensure convergence to the minimizer, we design a noise-adaptive multi-stage algorithm that results in an $O\left(\exp\left(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}}\right) + \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{T}}\right)$ rate when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the $\ell_2$ norm. We also consider the general smooth, strongly-convex setting and propose the first noise-adaptive SHB variant that converges to the minimizer at an $O(\exp(-\frac{T}{\kappa}) + \frac{\sigma^2}{T})$ rate when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the squared $\ell_2$ norm. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: The generation of toxic content by large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge for the safe deployment of language technology. We propose a novel framework for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text generation by fine-tuning LLMs with a prototype-based contrastive perplexity objective. Central to our method is the construction of hard negatives - toxic outputs that are generated through adversarial paraphrasing to be semantically similar and model probability to their non-toxic counterparts. By training on these challenging and realistic pairs, our approach ensures robust and stable contrastive optimization. Experimental results in the domain of detoxification demonstrate that our method significantly reduces toxic generation while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks such as commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of exploiting hard negatives for attribute-aware fine-tuning.

Abstract: In today's data-driven world, the proliferation of publicly available information raises security concerns due to the information leakage (IL) problem. IL involves unintentionally exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties via observable system information. Conventional statistical approaches rely on estimating mutual information (MI) between observable and secret information for detecting ILs, face challenges of the curse of dimensionality, convergence, computational complexity, and MI misestimation. Though effective, emerging supervised machine learning based approaches to detect ILs are limited to binary system sensitive information and lack a comprehensive framework. To address these limitations, we establish a theoretical framework using statistical learning theory and information theory to quantify and detect IL accurately. Using automated machine learning, we demonstrate that MI can be accurately estimated by approximating the typically unknown Bayes predictor's log-loss and accuracy. Based on this, we show how MI can effectively be estimated to detect ILs. Our method performs superior to state-of-the-art baselines in an empirical study considering synthetic and real-world OpenSSL TLS server datasets.

Abstract: Softmax distributions are widely used in machine learning, including Large Language Models (LLMs), where the attention unit uses softmax distributions. We abstract the attention unit as the softmax model, where given a vector input, the model produces an output drawn from the softmax distribution (which depends on the vector input). We consider the fundamental problem of binary hypothesis testing in the setting of softmax models. That is, given an unknown softmax model, which is known to be one of the two given softmax models, how many queries are needed to determine which one is the truth? We show that the sample complexity is asymptotically $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ where $\epsilon$ is a certain distance between the parameters of the models. Furthermore, we draw an analogy between the softmax model and the leverage score model, an important tool for algorithm design in linear algebra and graph theory. The leverage score model, on a high level, is a model which, given a vector input, produces an output drawn from a distribution dependent on the input. We obtain similar results for the binary hypothesis testing problem for leverage score models.

arXiv:2405.08719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by steady progress in deep generative modeling, simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as the workhorse for inferring the parameters of stochastic simulators. However, recent work has demonstrated that model misspecification can compromise the reliability of SBI, preventing its adoption in important applications where only misspecified simulators are available. This work introduces robust posterior estimation~(RoPE), a framework that overcomes model misspecification with a small real-world calibration set of ground-truth parameter measurements. We formalize the misspecification gap as the solution of an optimal transport~(OT) problem between learned representations of real-world and simulated observations, allowing RoPE to learn a model of the misspecification without placing additional assumptions on its nature. RoPE demonstrates how OT and a calibration set provide a controllable balance between calibrated uncertainty and informative inference, even under severely misspecified simulators. Results on four synthetic tasks and two real-world problems with ground-truth labels demonstrate that RoPE outperforms baselines and consistently returns informative and calibrated credible intervals.

<title>Compress then Serve: Serving Thousands of LoRA Adapters with Little Overhead</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for the joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are amenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA collections. Our experiments with up to 1000 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.

Abstract: Insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention with recent advancements in DNA storage technology. However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in the realistic DNA storage channel.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been empirically shown to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts. Given a query, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q\&amp;A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning various Q\&amp;A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently achieves excellent detection rates in nearly all cases.

Abstract: Illegitimate reproduction, distribution and derivation of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models can inflict economic loss, reputation damage and even privacy infringement. Passive DNN intellectual property (IP) protection methods such as watermarking and fingerprinting attempt to prove the ownership upon IP violation, but they are often too late to stop catastrophic damage of IP abuse and too feeble against strong adversaries. In this paper, we propose IDEA, an Inverse Domain Expert Adaptation based proactive DNN IP protection method featuring active authorization and source traceability. IDEA generalizes active authorization as an inverse problem of domain adaptation. The multi-adaptive optimization is solved by a mixture-of-experts model with one real and two fake experts. The real expert re-optimizes the source model to correctly classify test images with a unique model user key steganographically embedded. The fake experts are trained to output random prediction on test images without or with incorrect user key embedded by minimizing their mutual information (MI) with the real expert. The MoE model is knowledge distilled into a unified protected model to avoid leaking the expert model features by maximizing their MI with additional multi-layer attention and contrastive representation loss optimization. IDEA not only prevents unauthorized users without the valid key to access the functional model, but also enable the model owner to validate the deployed model and trace the source of IP infringement. We extensively evaluate IDEA on five datasets and four DNN models to demonstrate its effectiveness in authorization control, culprit tracing success rate, and robustness against various attacks.

Abstract: Understanding how neuronal networks reorganize in response to external stimuli and give rise to behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods often fail to capture the evolving structure of neural connectivity in ways that capture its relationship to behavior, especially in dynamic, uncertain, or high-dimensional settings with sufficient resolution or interpretability. We introduce the Temporal Attention-enhanced Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Network (TAVRNN), a novel framework that models time-varying neuronal connectivity by integrating probabilistic graph learning with temporal attention mechanisms. TAVRNN learns latent dynamics at the single-unit level while maintaining interpretable population-level representations, to identify key connectivity patterns linked to behavior. TAVRNN generalizes across diverse neural systems and modalities, demonstrating state-of-the-art classification and clustering performance. We validate TAVRNN on three diverse datasets: (1) electrophysiological data from a freely behaving rat, (2) primate somatosensory cortex recordings during a reaching task, and (3) biological neurons in the DishBrain platform interacting with a virtual game environment. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic embedding techniques, revealing previously unreported relationships between adaptive behavior and the evolving topological organization of neural networks. These findings demonstrate that TAVRNN offers a powerful and generalizable approach for modeling neural dynamics across experimental and synthetic biological systems. Its architecture is modality-agnostic and scalable, making it applicable across a wide range of neural recording platforms and behavioral paradigms.

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of LLMs, the field of human motion understanding has increasingly shifted toward developing large motion models. Despite some progress, current efforts remain far from achieving truly generalist models, primarily due to the lack of massive high-quality data. To address this gap, we present MotionLib, the first million-level dataset for motion generation, which is at least 15$\times$ larger than existing counterparts and enriched with hierarchical text descriptions. Using MotionLib, we train a large motion model named \projname, demonstrating robust performance across a wide range of human activities, including unseen ones. Through systematic investigation, for the first time, we highlight the importance of scaling both data and model size for advancing motion generation, along with key insights to achieve this goal. To better integrate the motion modality, we propose Motionbook, an innovative motion encoding approach including (1) a compact yet lossless feature to represent motions; (2) a novel 2D lookup-free motion tokenizer that preserves fine-grained motion details while expanding codebook capacity, significantly enhancing the representational power of motion tokens. We believe this work lays the groundwork for developing more versatile and powerful motion generation models in the future. For further details, visit https://beingbeyond.github.io/Being-M0/.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning (ICL) excel in many tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, demonstration selection and ordering greatly impact ICL effectiveness. To address this, we propose DemoShapley and Beta-DemoShapley, inspired by Data Shapley and Beta Shapley, to assess the influence of individual demonstrations. DemoShapley captures how each example influences performance in different contexts, unlike other influence-based methods that rely on a fixed number of demonstrations. Beta-DemoShapley further enhances this framework by incorporating the Beta distribution, allowing users to assign higher weights to smaller cardinalities, which aligns with ICL's prompt length and computational constraints. Our findings show that the proposed algorithms improve model performance by selecting quality demonstrations, and enhancing generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. It also identifies noise-compromised data and promotes fairness in LLMs, protecting model performance and ensuring robustness across various scenarios.

Abstract: Many court systems are overwhelmed all over the world, leading to huge backlogs of pending cases. Effective triage systems, like those in emergency rooms, could ensure proper prioritization of open cases, optimizing time and resource allocation in the court system. In this work, we introduce the Criticality Prediction dataset, a novel resource for evaluating case prioritization. Our dataset features a two-tier labeling system: (1) the binary LD-Label, identifying cases published as Leading Decisions (LD), and (2) the more granular Citation-Label, ranking cases by their citation frequency and recency, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation. Unlike existing approaches that rely on resource-intensive manual annotations, we algorithmically derive labels leading to a much larger dataset than otherwise possible. We evaluate several multilingual models, including both smaller fine-tuned models and large language models in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that the fine-tuned models consistently outperform their larger counterparts, thanks to our large training set. Our results highlight that for highly domain-specific tasks like ours, large training sets are still valuable.

Abstract: Gradient-based dimension reduction decreases the cost of Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling by identifying maximally informative (and informed) low-dimensional projections of the data and parameters, allowing high-dimensional problems to be reformulated as cheaper low-dimensional problems. A broad family of such techniques identify these projections and provide error bounds on the resulting posterior approximations, via eigendecompositions of certain diagnostic matrices. Yet these matrices require gradients or even Hessians of the log-likelihood, excluding the purely data-driven setting and many problems of simulation-based inference. We propose a framework, derived from score-matching, to extend gradient-based dimension reduction to problems where gradients are unavailable. Specifically, we formulate an objective function to directly learn the score ratio function needed to compute the diagnostic matrices, propose a tailored parameterization for the score ratio network, and introduce regularization methods that capitalize on the hypothesized low-dimensional structure. We also introduce a novel algorithm to iteratively identify the low-dimensional reduced basis vectors more accurately with limited data based on eigenvalue deflation methods. We show that our approach outperforms standard score-matching for problems with low-dimensional structure, and demonstrate its effectiveness for PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems and conditional generative modeling.

Abstract: We are motivated by the problem of autonomous vehicle performance validation. A key challenge is that an autonomous vehicle requires testing in every kind of driving scenario it could encounter, including rare events, to provide a strong case for safety and show there is no edge-case pathological behavior. Autonomous vehicle companies rely on potentially millions of miles driven in realistic simulation to expose the driving stack to enough miles to estimate rates and severity of collisions. To address scalability and coverage, we propose the use of a behavior foundation model, specifically a masked autoencoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct driving scenarios. We leverage the foundation model in two complementary ways: we (i) use the learned embedding space to group qualitatively similar scenarios together and (ii) fine-tune the model to label scenario difficulty based on the likelihood of a collision upon simulation. We use the difficulty scoring as importance weighting for the groups of scenarios. The result is an approach which can more rapidly estimate the rates and severity of collisions by prioritizing hard scenarios while ensuring exposure to every kind of driving scenario.

Abstract: Text emotion detection constitutes a crucial foundation for advancing artificial intelligence from basic comprehension to the exploration of emotional reasoning. Most existing emotion detection datasets rely on manual annotations, which are associated with high costs, substantial subjectivity, and severe label imbalances. This is particularly evident in the inadequate annotation of micro-emotions and the absence of emotional intensity representation, which fail to capture the rich emotions embedded in sentences and adversely affect the quality of downstream task completion. By proposing an all-labels and training-set label regression method, we map label values to energy intensity levels, thereby fully leveraging the learning capabilities of machine models and the interdependencies among labels to uncover multiple emotions within samples. This led to the establishment of the Emotion Quantization Network (EQN) framework for micro-emotion detection and annotation. Using five commonly employed sentiment datasets, we conducted comparative experiments with various models, validating the broad applicability of our framework within NLP machine learning models. Based on the EQN framework, emotion detection and annotation are conducted on the GoEmotions dataset. A comprehensive comparison with the results from Google literature demonstrates that the EQN framework possesses a high capability for automatic detection and annotation of micro-emotions. The EQN framework is the first to achieve automatic micro-emotion annotation with energy-level scores, providing strong support for further emotion detection analysis and the quantitative research of emotion computing.

Abstract: Model merging is an emerging technique that integrates multiple models fine-tuned on different tasks to create a versatile model that excels in multiple domains. This scheme, in the meantime, may open up backdoor attack opportunities where one single malicious model can jeopardize the integrity of the merged model. Existing works try to demonstrate the risk of such attacks by assuming substantial computational resources, focusing on cases where the attacker can fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. Such an assumption, however, may not be feasible given the increasing size of machine learning models. In practice where resources are limited and the attacker can only employ techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to produce the malicious model, it remains unclear whether the attack can still work and pose threats. In this work, we first identify that the attack efficacy is significantly diminished when using LoRA for fine-tuning. Then, we propose LoBAM, a method that yields high attack success rate with minimal training resources. The key idea of LoBAM is to amplify the malicious weights in an intelligent way that effectively enhances the attack efficacy. We demonstrate that our design can lead to improved attack success rate through extensive empirical experiments across various model merging scenarios. Moreover, we show that our method is highly stealthy and is difficult to detect and defend against.

Abstract: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enabled dialogue systems have become one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, which bring about vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from $\textit{Prelude}$ through $\textit{Interlocution}$ to $\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the dialogue stages to frame benchmark construction that covers comprehensive dialogue elements. This hinders the precise modeling, generation and assessment of LLMs-based dialogue systems. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task--$\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and SigLIP, have found remarkable success in classification, retrieval, and generative tasks. For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.

Abstract: This paper explores image modeling from the frequency space and introduces DCTdiff, an end-to-end diffusion generative paradigm that efficiently models images in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) space. We investigate the design space of DCTdiff and reveal the key design factors. Experiments on different frameworks (UViT, DiT), generation tasks, and various diffusion samplers demonstrate that DCTdiff outperforms pixel-based diffusion models regarding generative quality and training efficiency. Remarkably, DCTdiff can seamlessly scale up to 512$\times$512 resolution without using the latent diffusion paradigm and beats latent diffusion (using SD-VAE) with only 1/4 training cost. Finally, we illustrate several intriguing properties of DCT image modeling. For example, we provide a theoretical proof of why 'image diffusion can be seen as spectral autoregression', bridging the gap between diffusion and autoregressive models. The effectiveness of DCTdiff and the introduced properties suggest a promising direction for image modeling in the frequency space. The code is https://github.com/forever208/DCTdiff.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the matching recovery problem between a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices with a latent vertex correspondence. We are particularly interested in a robust version of this problem such that our observation is a perturbed input $(A+E,B+F)$ where $(A,B)$ is a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices and $E,F$ are adversarially chosen matrices supported on an unknown $\epsilon n * \epsilon n$ principle minor of $A,B$, respectively. We propose a vector approximate message passing (vector AMP) algorithm that succeeds in polynomial time as long as the correlation $\rho$ between $(A,B)$ is a non-vanishing constant and $\epsilon = o\big( \tfrac{1}{(\log n)^{20}} \big)$.
  The main methodological inputs for our result are the iterative random graph matching algorithm proposed in \cite{DL22+, DL23+} and the spectral cleaning procedure proposed in \cite{IS24+}. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient random graph matching type algorithm that is robust under any adversarial perturbations of $n^{1-o(1)}$ size.

Abstract: The ongoing revolution in language modeling has led to various novel applications, some of which rely on the emerging social abilities of large language models (LLMs). Already, many turn to the new cyber friends for advice during the pivotal moments of their lives and trust them with the deepest secrets, implying that accurate shaping of the LLM's personality is paramount. To this end, state-of-the-art approaches exploit a vast variety of training data, and prompt the model to adopt a particular personality. We ask (i) if personality-prompted models behave (i.e., make decisions when presented with a social situation) in line with the ascribed personality (ii) if their behavior can be finely controlled. We use classic psychological experiments, the Milgram experiment and the Ultimatum Game, as social interaction testbeds and apply personality prompting to open- and closed-source LLMs from 4 different vendors. Our experiments reveal failure modes of the prompt-based modulation of the models' behavior that are shared across all models tested and persist under prompt perturbations. These findings challenge the optimistic sentiment toward personality prompting generally held in the community.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose a statistical framework that incorporates key advancements to address specific challenges in pairwise comparison analysis. First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties -- an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons -- significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release leaderbot, an open-source Python package implementing our models and analyses.

Abstract: Understanding the causal interactions in some brain tasks, such as face processing, remains a challenging and ambiguous process for researchers. In this study, we address this issue by employing a novel causal discovery method -Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity (DAGMA)- to investigate the causal structure of the brain's face-selective network and gain deeper insights into its mechanism. Using fMRI data of natural movie stimuli, we extract causal network of face-selective regions and analyze how frames containing faces influence this network. Specifically, our findings reveal that the presence of faces in the stimuli, causally affects the number of identified connections within the network. Additionally, our results highlight the crucial role of subcortical regions in satisfying causal sufficiency, emphasizing it's importance in causal studies of brain. This study provides a new perspective on understanding the causal architecture of the face-selective network of the brain, motivating further research on neural causality.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models mostly use a router to assign tokens to specific expert modules, activating only partial parameters and often outperforming dense models. We argue that the separation between the router's decision-making and the experts' execution is a critical yet overlooked issue, leading to suboptimal expert selection and ineffective learning. To address this, we propose Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE), a novel MoE paradigm in which experts autonomously select themselves to process inputs. AoE is based on the insight that an expert is aware of its own capacity to effectively process a token, an awareness reflected in the scale of its internal activations. In AoE, routers are removed; instead, experts pre-compute internal activations for inputs and are ranked based on their activation norms. Only the top-ranking experts proceed with the forward pass, while the others abort. The overhead of pre-computing activations is reduced through a low-rank weight factorization. This self-evaluating-then-partner-comparing approach ensures improved expert selection and effective learning. We pre-train language models having 700M up to 4B parameters, demonstrating that AoE outperforms traditional MoE models with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: We provide a new online learning algorithm for tackling the Multinomial Logit Bandit (MNL-Bandit) problem. Despite the challenges posed by the combinatorial nature of the MNL model, we develop a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based method that achieves Pareto optimality by balancing regret minimization and estimation error of the assortment revenues and the MNL parameters. We develop theoretical guarantees characterizing the tradeoff between regret and estimation error for the MNL-Bandit problem through information-theoretic bounds, and propose a modified UCB algorithm that incorporates forced exploration to improve parameter estimation accuracy while maintaining low regret. Our analysis sheds critical insights into how to optimally balance the collected revenues and the treatment estimation in dynamic assortment optimization.

Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction aims to map labeled data to a low-dimensional feature space while maximizing class discriminability. Directly computing discriminability is often impractical, so an alternative approach is to learn features that maximize a distance or dissimilarity measure between classes. The Fisher-Rao distance is an important information geometry distance in statistical manifolds. It is induced by the Fisher information metric, a tool widely used for understanding neural representations. Despite its theoretical and pratical appeal, Fisher-Rao distances between classes have not been used as a maximization objective in supervised feature learning. Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a linear dimensionality reduction method that maximizes Fisher-Rao distances between class distributions, by exploiting the information geometry of the symmetric positive definite manifold. SQFA maximizes distances using first- and second-order statistics, and its features allow for quadratic discriminability (i.e. QDA performance) matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. We theoretically motivate Fisher-Rao distances as a proxy for quadratic discriminability, and compare its performance to other popular distances (e.g. Wasserstein distances). SQFA provides a flexible state-of-the-art method for dimensionality reduction. Its successful use of Fisher-Rao distances between classes motivates future research directions.

arXiv:2502.02017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness for high-resolution image synthesis. However, the properties of the latent space from tokenizer for better learning and generation of diffusion models remain under-explored. Theoretically and empirically, we find that improved generation quality is closely tied to the latent distributions with better structure, such as the ones with fewer Gaussian Mixture modes and more discriminative features. Motivated by these insights, we propose MAETok, an autoencoder (AE) leveraging mask modeling to learn semantically rich latent space while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments validate our analysis, demonstrating that the variational form of autoencoders is not necessary, and a discriminative latent space from AE alone enables state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation using only 128 tokens. MAETok achieves significant practical improvements, enabling a gFID of 1.69 with 76x faster training and 31x higher inference throughput for 512x512 generation. Our findings show that the structure of the latent space, rather than variational constraints, is crucial for effective diffusion models. Code and trained models are released.

Abstract: We examine limits of in-context learning (ICL) in transformer models trained from scratch, focusing on function approximation tasks as a controlled setting to uncover fundamental behaviors. While we show empirically that transformer models can generalize, approximating unseen classes of polynomial (non linear) functions, they cannot generalize beyond certain values. We provide both empirical and mathematical arguments explaining that these limitations stem from architectural components, namely layer normalization and the attention scoring function, softmax. Together, our findings reveal structural constraints on ICL that are often masked in more complex NLP tasks but that need to be understood to improve robustness and interpretability in transformer-based models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks through in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the demonstrations selected from annotated datasets. However, these datasets often exhibit long-tailed class distributions in real-world scenarios, leading to biased demonstration selection. In this work, we show that such class imbalances significantly degrade the ICL performance across various tasks, regardless of selection methods. Moreover, classical rebalancing methods, which focus solely on class weights, yield poor performance due to neglecting condition bias--skewed feature distributions within classes. To address this, we propose Reweighting with Conditional Bias (dubbed RCB), a simple and complementary approach to enhance ICL performance under class imbalance. In particular, RCB estimates conditional bias using a balanced subset and re-weights demonstration scores based on both class weight and conditional bias. In effect, RCB prevents over-selection from dominant classes while preserving the efficacy of current selection methods. Extensive experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average accuracy of current selection methods by up to 5.42%.

Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques including SFT and RLHF face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become untenable when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) \textit{Critique of critique can be easier than critique itself}, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) \textit{This difficulty relationship is recursively held}, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. We further conduct Human-AI and AI-AI experiments to investigate the potential of utilizing recursive self-critiquing for AI supervision. Our results highlight recursive critique as a promising approach for scalable AI oversight.

Abstract: While there has been plenty of work on generating tests from existing code, there has been limited work on generating tests from issues. A correct test must validate the code patch that resolves the issue. This paper focuses on the scenario where that code patch does not yet exist. Doing so supports two major use-cases. First, it supports TDD (test-driven development), the discipline of "test first, write code later" that has well-documented benefits for human software engineers. Second, it also validates SWE (software engineering) agents, which generate code patches for resolving issues. This paper introduces TDD-Bench-Verified, a benchmark for generating tests from issues, and Otter, an LLM-based solution for this task. Otter augments LLMs with rule-based analysis to check and repair their outputs, and introduces a novel self-reflective action planner. Experiments show Otter outperforming state-of-the-art systems for generating tests from issues, in addition to enhancing systems that generate patches from issues. We hope that Otter helps make developers more productive at resolving issues and leads to more robust, well-tested code.

Abstract: Effective deepfake detection tools are becoming increasingly essential to the growing usage of deepfakes in unethical practices. There exists a wide range of deepfake generation techniques, which makes it challenging to develop an accurate universal detection mechanism. The 2025 IEEE Signal Processing Cup (\textit{DFWild-Cup} competition) provided a diverse dataset of deepfake images containing significant class imbalance. The images in the dataset are generated from multiple deepfake image generators, for training machine learning model(s) to emphasize the generalization of deepfake detection. To this end, we proposed a disjoint set-based multistage training method to address the class imbalance and devised an ensemble-based architecture \emph{CAE-Net}. Our architecture consists of a convolution- and attention-based ensemble network, and employs three different neural network architectures: EfficientNet, Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and ConvNeXt with wavelet transform to capture both local and global features of deepfakes. We visualize the specific regions that these models focus on for classification using Grad-CAM, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in grouping real and fake images into cohesive clusters using t-SNE plots. Individually, the EfficientNet B0 architecture has achieved 90.79\% accuracy, whereas the ConvNeXt and the DeiT architecture have achieved 89.49\% and 89.32\% accuracy, respectively. With these networks, our weighted ensemble model achieves an excellent accuracy of 94.63\% on the validation dataset of the SP Cup 2025 competition. The equal error rate of 4.72\% and the Area Under the ROC curve of 97.37\% further confirm the stability of our proposed method. Finally, the robustness of our proposed model against adversarial perturbation attacks is tested as well, showing the inherent defensive properties of the ensemble approach.

Abstract: Tool use has turned large language models (LLMs) into powerful agents that can perform complex multi-step tasks by dynamically utilising external software components. However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains demanding large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, an agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a GitHub URL and short task description, ToolMaker autonomously installs dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism for debugging. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 complex computational tasks spanning various domains with over 100 unit tests to assess correctness and robustness. Our method correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents. ToolMaker therefore is a step towards fully autonomous agent-based scientific workflows. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/KatherLab/ToolMaker.

<title>BaxBench: Can LLMs Generate Correct and Secure Backends?</title>

Abstract: Automatic program generation has long been a fundamental challenge in computer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 62% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on around half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.

Abstract: Scaling up executable code data is significant for improving language models' software engineering capability. The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.

Abstract: Deep latent variable models learn condensed representations of data that, hopefully, reflect the inner workings of the studied phenomena. Unfortunately, these latent representations are not statistically identifiable, meaning they cannot be uniquely determined. Domain experts, therefore, need to tread carefully when interpreting these. Current solutions limit the lack of identifiability through additional constraints on the latent variable model, e.g. by requiring labeled training data, or by restricting the expressivity of the model. We change the goal: instead of identifying the latent variables, we identify relationships between them such as meaningful distances, angles, and volumes. We prove this is feasible under very mild model conditions and without additional labeled data. We empirically demonstrate that our theory results in more reliable latent distances, offering a principled path forward in extracting trustworthy conclusions from deep latent variable models.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a crucial technique for improving the performance of machine learning applications across domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and perception systems. However, in certain scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments, some modalities available during training may be absent during inference. While existing frameworks effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they are primarily designed for single-agent settings. This poses a critical limitation in dynamic environments such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. Conversely, some works explore multi-agent collaboration but without addressing missing modality at test time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning (CAML), a novel multi-modal multi-agent framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multi-modal data during training, while allowing inference with reduced modalities during testing. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that CAML achieves up to a ${\bf 58.1}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate CAML on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.6}\%$ improvement in mIoU.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.

Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.

Abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in distributed or federated environments are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, particularly availability attacks -adding imperceptible perturbations to training data, thereby rendering the trained model unavailable. Prior research in distributed machine learning has demonstrated such adversarial effects through the injection of gradients or data poisoning. In this study, we aim to enhance comprehension of the potential of weaker (and more probable) adversaries by posing the following inquiry: Can availability attacks be inflicted solely through the flipping of a subset of training labels, without altering features, and under a strict flipping budget? We analyze the extent of damage caused by constrained label flipping attacks. Focusing on a distributed classification problem, (1) we propose a novel formalization of label flipping attacks on logistic regression models and derive a greedy algorithm that is provably optimal at each training step. (2) To demonstrate that availability attacks can be approached by label flipping alone, we show that a budget of only $0.1\%$ of labels at each training step can reduce the accuracy of the model by $6\%$, and that some models can perform worse than random guessing when up to $25\%$ of labels are flipped. (3) We shed light on an interesting interplay between what the attacker gains from more write-access versus what they gain from more flipping budget. (4) we define and compare the power of targeted label flipping attack to that of an untargeted label flipping attack.

Abstract: In Switzerland legal translation is uniquely important due to the country's four official languages and requirements for multilingual legal documentation. However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators -- creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Additionally, we present SwiLTra-Judge, a specialized LLM evaluation system that aligns best with human expert assessments.

Abstract: Large language models have recently pushed open domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retriever-reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose EmbQA, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Specifically, we refine query representations via lightweight linear layers under an unsupervised contrastive learning objective, thereby reordering retrieved passages to highlight those most likely to contain correct answers. Additionally, we introduce an exploratory embedding that broadens the model's latent semantic space to diversify candidate generation and employs an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most confident answer automatically. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect HelpSteer3 data to train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.

Abstract: Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models. To address this, we propose DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach that simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses by harnessing this synergy. Our extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions. These findings highlight the potential of a contrastive approach to enhance the efficacy of LLM distillation by effectively aligning teacher and student models across varied data types.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence reveal the limits of purely predictive systems and call for a shift toward causal and collaborative reasoning. Drawing inspiration from the revolution of Grothendieck in mathematics, we introduce the relativity of causal knowledge, which posits structural causal models (SCMs) are inherently imperfect, subjective representations embedded within networks of relationships. By leveraging category theory, we arrange SCMs into a functor category and show that their observational and interventional probability measures naturally form convex structures. This result allows us to encode non-intervened SCMs with convex spaces of probability measures. Next, using sheaf theory, we construct the network sheaf and cosheaf of causal knowledge. These structures enable the transfer of causal knowledge across the network while incorporating interventional consistency and the perspective of the subjects, ultimately leading to the formal, mathematical definition of relative causal knowledge.

Abstract: Robust alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based -- training a reward model on preference pairs and optimizing with reinforcement learning (RL) -- or reward-free -- directly fine-tuning on ranked outputs. Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain the most robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two key challenges remain: (i) imbalanced safety datasets that over-represent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (ii) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DR-IRL}, which dynamically adjusts rewards through inverse reinforcement learning. We first construct a balanced safety dataset of seven harmful categories using Chain-of-Draft (CoD) template prompts, which reduce token usage and generation time compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We then train category-specific reward models on this dataset via IRL. Finally, to align the LLM, we introduce \textbf{GRPO-S} (Group Relative Policy Optimization--Scaling), a variant of GRPO that scales the reward during optimization to task difficulty -- data-level hardness measured by CLIP similarity and model-level responsiveness measured by reward gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baselines in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for automating various tasks in software development. This paper evaluates the capabilities of the Llama 2-70B model in automating these tasks for scientific applications written in commonly used programming languages. Using representative test problems, we assess the model's capacity to generate code, documentation, and unit tests, as well as its ability to translate existing code between commonly used programming languages. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the compilation, runtime behavior, and correctness of the generated and translated code. Additionally, we assess the quality of automatically generated code, documentation and unit tests. Our results indicate that while Llama 2-70B frequently generates syntactically correct and functional code for simpler numerical tasks, it encounters substantial difficulties with more complex, parallelized, or distributed computations, requiring considerable manual corrections. We identify key limitations and suggest areas for future improvements to better leverage AI-driven automation in scientific computing workflows.

<title>HSTU-BLaIR: Lightweight Contrastive Text Embedding for Generative Recommender</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems have underscored the complementary strengths of generative modeling and pretrained language models. We propose HSTU-BLaIR, a hybrid framework that augments the Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit (HSTU)-based generative recommender with BLaIR, a lightweight contrastive text embedding model. This integration enriches item representations with semantic signals from textual metadata while preserving HSTU's powerful sequence modeling capabilities.
  We evaluate HSTU-BLaIR on two e-commerce datasets: three subsets from the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset and the Steam dataset. We compare its performance against both the original HSTU-based recommender and a variant augmented with embeddings from OpenAI's state-of-the-art \texttt{text-embedding-3-large} model. Despite the latter being trained on a substantially larger corpus with significantly more parameters, our lightweight BLaIR-enhanced approach -- pretrained on domain-specific data -- achieves better performance in nearly all cases. Specifically, HSTU-BLaIR outperforms the OpenAI embedding-based variant on all but one metric, where it is marginally lower, and matches it on another. These findings highlight the effectiveness of contrastive text embeddings in compute-efficient recommendation settings.

Abstract: This study estimates cognitive effort (CE) based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and performance scores using a hybrid deep learning model. The estimation of CE enables educators to modify material to enhance learning effectiveness and student engagement. Relative neural efficiency (RNE) and relative neural involvement (RNI) are two metrics that have been used to represent CE. To estimate RNE and RNI we need hemodynamic response in the brain and the performance score of a task.We collected oxygenated hemoglobin ($\Delta \mathrm{HbO}$). Sixteen participants answered 16 questions in a unity-based educational game, each with a 30-second response time. We used deep learning models to predict the performance score and estimate RNE and RNI to understand CE. The study compares traditional machine learning techniques with deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and a hybrid CNN-GRU to determine which approach provides better accuracy in predicting performance scores. The result shows that the hybrid CNN-GRU gives better performance with 78.36\% training accuracy and 73.08\% test accuracy than other models. We performed XGBoost on the extracted GRU feature and got the highest accuracy (69.23\%). This suggests that the features learned from this hybrid model generalize better even in traditional machine learning algorithms. We used the $\Delta \mathrm{HbO}$ and predicted score to calculate RNE and RNI to observe cognitive effort in our four test cases. Our result shows that even with moderate accuracy, the predicted RNE and RNI closely follows the actual trends. we also observed that when participants were in a state of high CE, introducing rest led decrease of CE. These findings can be helpful to design and improve learning environments and provide valuable insights in learning materials.

Abstract: Prompt engineering for large language models is challenging, as even small prompt perturbations or model changes can significantly impact the generated output texts. Existing evaluation methods of LLM outputs, either automated metrics or human evaluation, have limitations, such as providing limited insights or being labor-intensive. We propose Spotlight, a new approach that combines both automation and human analysis. Based on data mining techniques, we automatically distinguish between random (decoding) variations and systematic differences in language model outputs. This process provides token patterns that describe the systematic differences and guide the user in manually analyzing the effects of their prompts and changes in models efficiently. We create three benchmarks to quantitatively test the reliability of token pattern extraction methods and demonstrate that our approach provides new insights into established prompt data. From a human-centric perspective, through demonstration studies and a user study, we show that our token pattern approach helps users understand the systematic differences of language model outputs. We are further able to discover relevant differences caused by prompt and model changes (e.g. related to gender or culture), thus supporting the prompt engineering process and human-centric model behavior research.

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

<title>X-Transfer Attacks: Towards Super Transferable Adversarial Attacks on CLIP</title>

Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Abstract: This study formalizes a computational model to simulate classical Persian poets' dynamics of influence through constructing a multi-dimensional similarity network. Using a rigorously curated dataset based on Ganjoor's corpus, we draw upon semantic, lexical, stylistic, thematic, and metrical features to demarcate each poet's corpus. Each is contained within weighted similarity matrices, which are then appended to generate an aggregate graph showing poet-to-poet influence. Further network investigation is carried out to identify key poets, style hubs, and bridging poets by calculating degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures. Further, for typological insight, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm to demarcate clusters of poets sharing both style and theme coherence, which correspond closely to acknowledged schools of literature like Sabk-e Hindi, Sabk-e Khorasani, and the Bazgasht-e Adabi phenomenon. Our findings provide a new data-driven view of Persian literature distinguished between canonical significance and interextual influence, thus highlighting relatively lesser-known figures who hold great structural significance. Combining computational linguistics with literary study, this paper produces an interpretable and scalable model for poetic tradition, enabling retrospective reflection as well as forward-looking research within digital humanities.

Abstract: Recent Foundation Model-enabled robotics (FMRs) display greatly improved general-purpose skills, enabling more adaptable automation than conventional robotics. Their ability to handle diverse tasks thus creates new opportunities to replace human labor. However, unlike general foundation models, FMRs interact with the physical world, where their actions directly affect the safety of humans and surrounding objects, requiring careful deployment and control. Based on this proposition, our survey comprehensively summarizes robot control approaches to mitigate physical risks by covering all the lifespan of FMRs ranging from pre-deployment to post-accident stage. Specifically, we broadly divide the timeline into the following three phases: (1) pre-deployment phase, (2) pre-incident phase, and (3) post-incident phase. Throughout this survey, we find that there is much room to study (i) pre-incident risk mitigation strategies, (ii) research that assumes physical interaction with humans, and (iii) essential issues of foundation models themselves. We hope that this survey will be a milestone in providing a high-resolution analysis of the physical risks of FMRs and their control, contributing to the realization of a good human-robot relationship.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms, particularly within Transformer architectures and large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized sequence modeling in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. To compute attention for increasingly long sequences, specialized accelerators have been proposed to execute key attention steps directly in hardware. Among the various recently proposed architectures, those based on variants of the FlashAttention algorithm, originally designed for GPUs, stand out due to their optimized computation, tiling capabilities, and reduced memory traffic. In this work, we focus on optimizing the kernel of floating-point-based FlashAttention using new hardware operators that fuse the computation of exponentials and vector multiplications, e.g., e^x, V. The proposed ExpMul hardware operators significantly reduce the area and power costs of FlashAttention-based hardware accelerators. When implemented in a 28nm ASIC technology, they achieve improvements of 28.8% in area and 17.6% in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art hardware architectures with separate exponentials and vector multiplications hardware operators.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

<title>Safety Alignment Can Be Not Superficial With Explicit Safety Signals</title>

arXiv:2505.17072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) have revealed that existing approaches often operate superficially, leaving models vulnerable to various adversarial attacks. Despite their significance, these studies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation for achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often presume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during the alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the learned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading models to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when confronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly introducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its signals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity and allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize that, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess the safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each necessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial attacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems.

Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare, yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.

<title>Robust Distributed Estimation: Extending Gossip Algorithms to Ranking and Trimmed Means</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized, relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank estimation and an $\mathcal{O}(\log(t)/t)$ rate for trimmed mean estimation, where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data distributions and contamination schemes.

Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations, and limited multilingual capability. While prior reviews have addressed these issues, they often focus on individual limitations or consider them within the broader context of evaluating overall model performance. This survey addresses the gap by presenting a data-driven, semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLMs (LLLMs) from 2022 to 2025, using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers, we extract 14,648 relevant limitation papers using keyword filtering and LLM-based classification, validated against expert labels. Using topic clustering (via two approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM), we identify between 7 and 15 prominent types of limitations discussed in recent LLM research across the ACL and arXiv datasets. We find that LLM-related research increases nearly sixfold in ACL and nearly fifteenfold in arXiv between 2022 and 2025, while LLLMs research grows even faster, by a factor of over 12 in ACL and nearly 28 in arXiv. Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization, hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations, knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2025. We offer a quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research and release a dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, available at: https://github.com/a-kostikova/LLLMs-Survey.

Abstract: Learning unknown dynamics under environmental (or external) constraints is fundamental to many fields (e.g., modern robotics), particularly challenging when constraint information is only locally available and uncertain. Existing approaches requiring global constraints or using probabilistic filtering fail to fully exploit the geometric structure inherent in local measurements (by using, e.g., sensors) and constraints. This paper presents a geometric framework unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning through a fiber bundle structure over the state space. This naturally induced geometric structure enables measurement-aware Control Barrier Functions that adapt to local sensing (or measurement) conditions. By integrating Neural ODEs, our framework learns continuous-time dynamics while preserving geometric constraints, with theoretical guarantees of learning convergence and constraint satisfaction dependent on sensing quality. The geometric framework not only enables efficient dynamics learning but also suggests promising directions for integration with reinforcement learning approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant improvements in both learning efficiency and constraint satisfaction over traditional methods, especially under limited and uncertain sensing conditions.

Abstract: Perceptual voice quality assessment is essential for diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluations of vocal function. Traditionally, expert raters use standard scales such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS). However, these metrics are subjective and prone to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated, objective assessment methods. This study proposes Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to extract high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and interpretability, we also introduce VOQANet+, which integrates low-level speech descriptors such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings into a hybrid representation. Unlike prior studies focused only on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A subset) of the Perceptual Voice Quality Dataset (PVQD), we evaluate our models on both vowel-based and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S subset) to improve generalizability. Results show that sentence-based input outperforms vowel-based input, especially at the patient level, underscoring the value of longer utterances for capturing perceptual voice attributes. VOQANet consistently surpasses baseline methods in root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving even better performance. Additional experiments under noisy conditions show that VOQANet+ maintains high prediction accuracy and robustness, supporting its potential for real-world and telehealth deployment.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the paradigm of scientific discovery, establishing AI-for-Science (AI4Science) as a dynamic and evolving field. However, there is still a lack of an effective framework for the overall assessment of AI4Science, particularly from a holistic perspective on data quality and model capability. Therefore, in this study, we propose SciHorizon, a comprehensive assessment framework designed to benchmark the readiness of AI4Science from both scientific data and LLM perspectives. First, we introduce a generalizable framework for assessing AI-ready scientific data, encompassing four key dimensions: Quality, FAIRness, Explainability, and Compliance-which are subdivided into 15 sub-dimensions. Drawing on data resource papers published between 2018 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals, we present recommendation lists of AI-ready datasets for Earth, Life, and Materials Sciences, making a novel and original contribution to the field. Concurrently, to assess the capabilities of LLMs across multiple scientific disciplines, we establish 16 assessment dimensions based on five core indicators Knowledge, Understanding, Reasoning, Multimodality, and Values spanning Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Life Sciences, and Earth and Space Sciences. Using the developed benchmark datasets, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of over 50 representative open-source and closed source LLMs. All the results are publicly available and can be accessed online at www.scihorizon.cn/en.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel framework for transfer reinforcement learning that addresses challenges such as the lack of performance guarantees and the risk of negative transfer. The framework is based on the pessimism principle and constructs a conservative estimation of the target domain's performance. This approach ensures safe and reliable decision-making while also avoiding negative transfer when multiple source domains are involved. Two types of conservative estimations are developed, and their effectiveness is rigorously characterized. Efficient distributed algorithms with convergence guarantees are proposed. The framework provides a theoretically sound and practically robust solution for transfer learning in reinforcement learning. <div>

Abstract: Transfer reinforcement learning aims to derive a near-optimal policy for a target environment with limited data by leveraging abundant data from related source domains. However, it faces two key challenges: the lack of performance guarantees for the transferred policy, which can lead to undesired actions, and the risk of negative transfer when multiple source domains are involved. We propose a novel framework based on the pessimism principle, which constructs and optimizes a conservative estimation of the target domain's performance. Our framework effectively addresses the two challenges by providing an optimized lower bound on target performance, ensuring safe and reliable decisions, and by exhibiting monotonic improvement with respect to the quality of the source domains, thereby avoiding negative transfer. We construct two types of conservative estimations, rigorously characterize their effectiveness, and develop efficient distributed algorithms with convergence guarantees. Our framework provides a theoretically sound and practically robust solution for transfer learning in reinforcement learning.

The dataset comprises 70k verified code pairs across host and device, addressing a critical gap in low-level GPU code portability. Leveraging this resource, we train the CASS family of domain-specific language models, achieving 95% source translation accuracy and 37.5% assembly translation accuracy, substantially outperforming commercial baselines such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Hipify. Our generated code matches native performance in over 85% of test cases, preserving runtime and memory behavior. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce CASS-Bench, a curated benchmark spanning 16 GPU domains with ground-truth execution. All data, models, and evaluation tools are released as open source to foster progress in GPU compiler tooling, binary compatibility, and LLM-guided hardware translation.

Summary: 
The article proposes a novel spatial FDR control method, fcHMRF-LIS, for voxel-wise multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis. By integrating the LIS-based testing procedure with a fully connected hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF), the method effectively captures complex spatial dependencies. It addresses three key challenges in neuroimaging applications: maintaining low variability in false discovery proportion and false non-discovery proportion, achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data, and accurately controlling FDR while reducing false non-discovery rates. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, as demonstrated through extensive simulations and application to an Alzheimer's disease dataset from the ADNI. The efficient expectation-maximization algorithm and innovative techniques such as CRF-RNN and permutohedral lattice filtering contribute to the method's success in accurately identifying neurobiologically relevant brain regions. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: False discovery rate (FDR) control methods are essential for voxel-wise multiple testing in neuroimaging data analysis, where hundreds of thousands or even millions of tests are conducted to detect brain regions associated with disease-related changes. Classical FDR control methods (e.g., BH, q-value, and LocalFDR) assume independence among tests and often lead to high false non-discovery rates (FNR). Although various spatial FDR control methods have been developed to improve power, they still fall short of jointly addressing three major challenges in neuroimaging applications: capturing complex spatial dependencies, maintaining low variability in both false discovery proportion (FDP) and false non-discovery proportion (FNP) across replications, and achieving computational scalability for high-resolution data. To address these challenges, we propose fcHMRF-LIS, a powerful, stable, and scalable spatial FDR control method for voxel-wise multiple testing. It integrates the local index of significance (LIS)-based testing procedure with a novel fully connected hidden Markov random field (fcHMRF) designed to model complex spatial structures using a parsimonious parameterization. We develop an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm incorporating mean-field approximation, the Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) technique, and permutohedral lattice filtering, reducing the time complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of tests. Extensive simulations demonstrate that fcHMRF-LIS achieves accurate FDR control, lower FNR, reduced variability in FDP and FNP, and a higher number of true positives compared to existing methods. Applied to an FDG-PET dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, fcHMRF-LIS identifies neurobiologically relevant brain regions and offers notable advantages in computational efficiency.

Summary:
- The study investigates the encoding of auscultation in self-supervised acoustic representation foundation models (FMs) for vital sign analysis.
- Six FMs, including HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM, Whisper, CLAP, and an in-house CLAP model, are evaluated using a phonocardiogram dataset and heart rate estimation model.
- Results show that FMs offer comparable performance to a baseline method relying on acoustic features for heart rate estimation.
- The in-house CLAP model's audio encoder outperforms the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error despite domain mismatch.
- This research demonstrates the potential of pre-trained FMs in enhancing heart sound analysis and vital sign monitoring. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.20745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auscultation, particularly heart sound, is a non-invasive technique that provides essential vital sign information. Recently, self-supervised acoustic representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM, Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024 (which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.

Summary:<br />
Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is essential for biodiversity conservation but faces challenges like limited annotated data, sparse events, and species diversity. This study introduces the mismatch-first farthest-traversal (MFFT) method for efficient model development with limited labeling budget. The method combines committee voting disagreement and diversity analysis and achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 68% in cold-start scenarios and 71% in warm-start scenarios with only 2.3% of annotations. This performance is close to fully-supervised results. MFFT excels in detecting rare species, crucial for monitoring endangered species. The study also refines a BioSED dataset for active learning algorithm evaluation, highlighting MFFT's practical value in BioSED tasks. <div>

Abstract: Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is crucial for biodiversity conservation but faces practical challenges during model development and training: limited amounts of annotated data, sparse events, species diversity, and class imbalance. To address these challenges efficiently with a limited labeling budget, we apply the mismatch-first farthest-traversal (MFFT), an active learning method integrating committee voting disagreement and diversity analysis. We also refine an existing BioSED dataset specifically for evaluating active learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MFFT achieves a mAP of 68% when cold-starting and 71% when warm-starting (which is close to the fully-supervised mAP of 75%) while using only 2.3% of the annotations. Notably, MFFT excels in cold-start scenarios and with rare species, which are critical for monitoring endangered species, demonstrating its practical value.

Summary: The research introduces DeSocial, a decentralized social network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum local development chain. It gives users the ability to choose algorithms for personalized social predictions in a blockchain environment. Users can evaluate multiple backbone models on their local subgraph, select the most suitable backbone for personalized prediction, and aggregate prediction results through majority voting from validation nodes. The framework shows significant improvement compared to centralized models, emphasizing user empowerment in blockchain-based decentralized social networks. Multi-node validation and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain play a key role in enhancing social predictions in a decentralized setting. The implementation of the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Web 2.0 social platforms are inherently centralized, with user data and algorithmic decisions controlled by the platform. However, users can only passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/agiresearch/DeSocial.

arXiv:2505.22686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is crucial for managing risks and economic planning, particularly in tropical Africa, where extreme events severely impact livelihoods. Yet, existing forecasting methods often struggle with the region's complex, non-linear weather patterns. This study benchmarks deep recurrent neural networks such as $\texttt{LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU}$, and Kolmogorov-Arnold-based models $(\texttt{KAN} and \texttt{TKAN})$ for daily forecasting of temperature, precipitation, and pressure in two tropical cities: Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Kigali (Rwanda). We further introduce two customized variants of $ \texttt{TKAN}$ that replace its original $\texttt{SiLU}$ activation function with $ \texttt{GeLU}$ and \texttt{MiSH}, respectively. Using station-level meteorological data spanning from 2010 to 2024, we evaluate all the models on standard regression metrics. $\texttt{KAN}$ achieves temperature prediction ($R^2=0.9986$ in Abidjan, $0.9998$ in Kigali, $\texttt{MSE} < 0.0014~^\circ C ^2$), while $\texttt{TKAN}$ variants minimize absolute errors for precipitation forecasting in low-rainfall regimes. The customized $\texttt{TKAN}$ models demonstrate improvements over the standard $\texttt{TKAN}$ across both datasets. Classical \texttt{RNNs} remain highly competitive for atmospheric pressure ($R^2 \approx 0.83{-}0.86$), outperforming $\texttt{KAN}$-based models in this task. These results highlight the potential of spline-based neural architectures for efficient and data-efficient forecasting.

Summary: 
- Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but computationally expensive, limiting their deployment.
- Structured pruning is an effective way to compress LLM parameters, but determining importance and minimizing performance loss are key challenges.
- SlimLLM is a new structured pruning method for LLMs that evaluates importance based on entire channels or attention heads.

- A linear regression strategy for the output matrix enables quick performance recovery and a layer-based importance ratio determines the pruning ratio for each layer.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have garnered significant attention and demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications. However, due to their enormous computational costs, the deployment and application of LLMs are often severely limited. To address this issue, structured pruning is an effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the importance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are critical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In this paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named SlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we evaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely aggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This approach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among elements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear regression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance. We also propose layer-based importance ratio to determine the pruning ratio for each layer. Based on the LLaMA benchmark results, our SlimLLM outperforms other methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:
In this study, the authors propose a novel approach, Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE), for multi-task Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). MoRE aligns different ranks of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules with different tasks, creating low-rank experts, and utilizes an adaptive rank selector to choose the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training these experts, MoRE enhances the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. Extensive experiments on various multi-task benchmarks with different LLMs show that MoRE outperforms traditional LoRA and its variants in multi-task settings without increasing inference cost. The released model and code aim to benefit the research community by facilitating further exploration of efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and incurs no additional inference cost. We also release the model and code to facilitate the community.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face significant challenges in optimizing order dispatching and driver repositioning operations in dynamic urban environments. Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness, interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1) Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2) Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning, which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language models within intelligent transportation systems.

Neuroevolution (NE) is investigated for its transfer learning capabilities, with two benchmarks introduced: stepping gates and ecorobot. Stepping gates task neural networks with emulating logic circuits, while ecorobot extends the Brax physics engine with obstacles and different robotic morphologies. A curriculum is present in both benchmarks to evaluate skill transfer across tasks of increasing complexity.

These findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for building adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE to complex, real-world problems.

arXiv:2505.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima. In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE to complex, real-world problems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining. This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model, often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads. Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without relying on a single training step or datapoint.

Summary: Many trustworthy ML problems involve minimizing model error while meeting prediction rate constraints on selected marginals, such as group fairness constraints. This study explores constrained minimization under differential privacy (DP). The RaCO-DP algorithm, a DP adaptation of Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA), tackles rate constraint problems by solving their Lagrangian formulation. The algorithm's privacy cost is equivalent to privately estimating a histogram for the mini-batch at each optimization step. Convergence is proven through an innovative analysis leveraging the dual parameter's linear structure. Empirical tests on learning under group fairness constraints reveal that RaCO-DP outperforms existing private learning methods in fairness-utility trade-offs. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.22703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems in trustworthy ML can be formulated as minimization of the model error under constraints on the prediction rates of the model for suitably-chosen marginals, including most group fairness constraints (demographic parity, equality of odds, etc.). In this work, we study such constrained minimization problems under differential privacy (DP). Standard DP optimization techniques like DP-SGD rely on the loss function's decomposability into per-sample contributions. However, rate constraints introduce inter-sample dependencies, violating the decomposability requirement. To address this, we develop RaCO-DP, a DP variant of the Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA) algorithm which solves the Lagrangian formulation of rate constraint problems. We demonstrate that the additional privacy cost of incorporating these constraints reduces to privately estimating a histogram over the mini-batch at each optimization step. We prove the convergence of our algorithm through a novel analysis of SGDA that leverages the linear structure of the dual parameter. Finally, empirical results on learning under group fairness constraints demonstrate that our method Pareto-dominates existing private learning approaches in fairness-utility trade-offs.

Summary:
FlashFormer is a new kernel designed to accelerate single-batch inference for transformer-based large language models. The kernel aims to optimize performance for low-batch inference scenarios, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch overheads are key factors. Compared to existing state-of-the-art inference kernels, FlashFormer demonstrates significant speedups across various model sizes and quantization settings. This specialized kernel is particularly useful for applications such as edge deployment and latency-sensitive tasks, where low-batch inference is crucial. The size and compute characteristics of modern language models have driven the need for tailored kernels, and FlashFormer addresses the specific challenges of single-batch inference, providing efficient solutions for improving performance and efficiency in this context. <div>

Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for training and inference. Existing kernels primarily optimize for compute utilization, targeting the large-batch training and inference settings. However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch overheads contribute are significant factors, remains important for many applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, a proof-of-concept kernel for accelerating single-batch inference for transformer-based large language models.

<div> test-time augmentation, conformal classifier, predicted classes, probabilistic guarantee, inductive biases

Summary: 
Test-time augmentation (TTA) is shown to reduce the size of predicted classes produced by conformal classifiers while providing probabilistic guarantees. The approach is flexible, computationally efficient, and requires no model retraining. It can be combined with any conformal score and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. An evaluation across three datasets, three models, two conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and distribution shifts demonstrates the effectiveness of TTA in enhancing the conformal pipeline. <div>

Abstract: A conformal classifier produces a set of predicted classes and provides a probabilistic guarantee that the set includes the true class. Unfortunately, it is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models, two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

Summary:
- The paper discusses value-aware model learning and the popular MuZero loss used in model-based reinforcement learning.
- It highlights that the MuZero loss, along with similar losses, are uncalibrated surrogate losses, leading to incorrect model and value function recovery.
- The authors propose corrections to address this issue and improve model and value function predictions.
- The study explores the relationship between loss calibration, latent model architectures, and auxiliary losses in training MuZero-style agents.
- The findings suggest that while deterministic models can predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models remains beneficial. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of value-aware model learning, that models should produce accurate value estimates, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning. The MuZero loss, which penalizes a model's value function prediction compared to the ground-truth value function, has been utilized in several prominent empirical works in the literature. However, theoretical investigation into its strengths and weaknesses is limited. In this paper, we analyze the family of value-aware model learning losses, which includes the popular MuZero loss. We show that these losses, as normally used, are uncalibrated surrogate losses, which means that they do not always recover the correct model and value function. Building on this insight, we propose corrections to solve this issue. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between the loss calibration, latent model architectures, and auxiliary losses that are commonly employed when training MuZero-style agents. We show that while deterministic models can be sufficient to predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models is still advantageous.

Summary: 
Machine Learning models are widely available online, offering exciting opportunities for non-experts. However, the open ecosystem also poses risks, such as the potential for malicious attacks or vulnerabilities in the models. Sigstore, a solution for open-source software supply chains, could be used to enhance transparency in open ML models. By enabling model publishers to sign their models and verify properties of the datasets used, Sigstore could mitigate the risks associated with the current ecosystem. This approach would help prevent attackers from substituting models with harmful content, ensure models are trained on secure frameworks, and validate the integrity of the data used. Through transparency and verification mechanisms, Sigstore could establish trust and enhance the security of open ML models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful machine learning (ML) models are now readily available online, which creates exciting possibilities for users who lack the deep technical expertise or substantial computing resources needed to develop them. On the other hand, this type of open ecosystem comes with many risks. In this paper, we argue that the current ecosystem for open ML models contains significant supply-chain risks, some of which have been exploited already in real attacks. These include an attacker replacing a model with something malicious (e.g., malware), or a model being trained using a vulnerable version of a framework or on restricted or poisoned data. We then explore how Sigstore, a solution designed to bring transparency to open-source software supply chains, can be used to bring transparency to open ML models, in terms of enabling model publishers to sign their models and prove properties about the datasets they use.

<div> latent space, autoencoder models, neural networks, dynamical systems, vector field

Summary:
Neural networks can be viewed as dynamical systems that operate on a latent manifold, creating a vector field through the encoding-decoding map of autoencoder models. Training neural models introduces biases leading to attractor points in this vector field. This representation allows for analyzing generalization and memorization during training, extracting prior knowledge from network parameters encoded in attractors, and identifying out-of-distribution samples based on their trajectories. The approach is validated on vision foundation models, demonstrating its practicality. <div>
arXiv:2505.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space. In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold, derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i) analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii) identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

Summary: <br />
The article focuses on the need for effective neural network certification in safety- and security-critical applications, specifically against "patch attacks" that obscure parts of images. It introduces improvements to the PREMAP algorithm for preimage approximation, including tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and enhanced branching heuristics.

arXiv:2505.22798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence in safety- and security-critical applications demands effective neural network certification. A challenging real-world use case is certification against ``patch attacks'', where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for example traffic signs. One approach to certification, which also gives quantitative coverage estimates, utilizes preimages of neural networks, i.e., the set of inputs that lead to a specified output. However, these preimage approximation methods, including the state-of-the-art PREMAP algorithm, struggle with scalability. This paper presents novel algorithmic improvements to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved branching heuristics. We demonstrate efficiency improvements of at least an order of magnitude on reinforcement learning control benchmarks, and show that our method scales to convolutional neural networks that were previously infeasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of preimage approximation methodology for reliability and robustness certification.

Summary:
CLUE (Calibration via Learning Uncertainty-Error Alignment) introduces a novel approach for reliable uncertainty estimation in neural networks. It focuses on aligning predicted uncertainty with observed error during training, leading to well-calibrated models with accurate uncertainty estimates. The method optimizes predictive performance and calibration simultaneously using summary statistics of uncertainty and loss. CLUE is fully differentiable, domain-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates into standard training pipelines. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that CLUE achieves superior calibration quality and competitive predictive performance compared to existing techniques, even in out-of-distribution and domain-shift scenarios. The approach does not incur significant computational overhead, making it practical for real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2505.22803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is critical for deploying neural networks (NNs) in real-world applications. While existing calibration techniques often rely on post-hoc adjustments or coarse-grained binning methods, they remain limited in scalability, differentiability, and generalization across domains. In this work, we introduce CLUE (Calibration via Learning Uncertainty-Error Alignment), a novel approach that explicitly aligns predicted uncertainty with observed error during training, grounded in the principle that well-calibrated models should produce uncertainty estimates that match their empirical loss. CLUE adopts a novel loss function that jointly optimizes predictive performance and calibration, using summary statistics of uncertainty and loss as proxies. The proposed method is fully differentiable, domain-agnostic, and compatible with standard training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on vision, regression, and language modeling tasks, including out-of-distribution and domain-shift scenarios, we demonstrate that CLUE achieves superior calibration quality and competitive predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches without imposing significant computational overhead.

<div> dataset quality, machine learning classifiers, model architecture, dataset size, class balance

Summary:
Quality of datasets is an intrinsic factor that significantly influences the performance of machine learning classifiers, independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance. Through experimentation with thousands of controlled datasets and various classifier architectures, a strong correlation was found between classifier performance and dataset quality. This correlation suggests that dataset quality is a fundamental property linked to the quality of the constituent classes within the datasets. The study highlights dataset quality as a separate target for optimizing machine-learning-based classification, alongside size, class balance, and model architecture. This research provides valuable insights for enhancing the performance of machine learning classifiers by considering and improving dataset quality as a key factor. <div>
arXiv:2505.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the universal quest to optimize machine-learning classifiers, three factors -- model architecture, dataset size, and class balance -- have been shown to influence test-time performance but do not fully account for it. Previously, evidence was presented for an additional factor that can be referred to as dataset quality, but it was unclear whether this was actually a joint property of the dataset and the model architecture, or an intrinsic property of the dataset itself. If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the same datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other factors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each controlled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a wide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to deep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by subset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic property of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model architecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an emergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets' constituent classes. Thus, quality joins size, class balance, and model architecture as an independent correlate of performance and a separate target for optimizing machine-learning-based classification.

Summary:
This paper introduces a method to incorporate response time data into human preference learning frameworks, enhancing reward model elicitation. By integrating the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion model, the study utilizes response time information to capture preference strength. The proposed Neyman-orthogonal loss functions ensure optimal convergence rates for reward model learning compared to traditional preference learning approaches. The theoretical analysis reveals exponential error scaling in conventional methods for linear reward functions, which is significantly reduced to polynomial scaling through the response time-augmented approach. The study extends its findings to non-parametric reward function spaces, demonstrating convergence properties for more complex reward models. Extensive experiments in image preference learning validate the theoretical conclusions. <div>
arXiv:2505.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation. While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

arXiv:2505.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.

Summary: This paper explores the intersection of distribution shift and AI safety by analyzing their conceptual and methodological connections.

<div> randomness, compression, diffusion models, adversarial robustness, purification

Summary:
Diffusion models have been found to enhance adversarial robustness empirically, but the precise mechanisms behind this improvement have been unclear. Contrary to intuition, the models actually increase the distance to clean samples rather than decreasing it. The purified images are heavily influenced by the internal randomness of the diffusion models, leading to a compression effect within each randomness configuration. When evaluating robustness under fixed randomness, the improvement drops to 24% on CIFAR-10, much lower than previous reports. The remaining robustness gain is strongly correlated with the model's ability to compress the input space, making the compression rate a reliable indicator of robustness without requiring gradient-based analysis. These findings shed light on how diffusion-based purification works and provide insights for developing more effective adversarial purification systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed, the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly increase, rather than decrease, the $\ell_p$ distance to clean samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.

<div> diffusion models, generative sampling, regularization, memorization, variance control  
Summary:  
Diffusion models are now the standard in high-fidelity generative sampling but can be prone to memorization. The empirical score can overfit the dataset, leading to reverse-time SDE samples being mostly training points. Introducing a kernel-smoothed empirical score can help reduce noise variance and improve generalization by balancing bias and variance. Regularization on the score or increasing the size of the training dataset can prevent memorization. The spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better variance control under certain conditions. Reverse diffusion with a kernel-smoothed empirical score can be seen as a gradient descent towards a Log-Exponential Double-Kernel Density Estimator, highlighting the regularization mechanisms in denoising diffusions. Even simple regularization without learning can mitigate memorization and enhance generalization. Experimental results on synthetic and MNIST datasets support these findings. <div>
arXiv:2505.22841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling, yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization. Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic and MNIST datasets.

Abstract: Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies, including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We find that Causal-PIK remains competitive on tasks that are very challenging, even for human problem-solvers.

Summary: 
Offline reinforcement learning faces challenges in applying diffusion and flow models due to their iterative noise sampling processes. The paper introduces Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning (SORL), which utilizes shortcut models to scale training and inference efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. SORL's policy can handle complex data distributions and achieves strong performance in various offline RL tasks. At test time, SORL utilizes the learned Q-function for sequential and parallel inference scaling. The algorithm shows positive scaling behavior with increased test-time compute.

arXiv:2505.22866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have emerged as powerful generative approaches capable of modeling diverse and multimodal behavior. However, applying these models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning (SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased test-time compute. We release the code at nico-espinosadice.github.io/projects/sorl.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO) with inequality constraints influenced by uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning model. The contextual uncertainty sets are constructed using methods like conformal prediction to handle the uncertainty in constraints. A new loss function called "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) is introduced, which is feasibility-sensitive and measures the decision error of predicted objective parameters. A convex surrogate called SPO-RC+ is also introduced, and its Fisher consistency with SPO-RC is proven. Training on truncated datasets and correcting sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques are proposed to enhance performance. Experimental results on fractional knapsack and alloy production problems demonstrate the effectiveness of SPO-RC+ in handling uncertain constraints and the improvement in performance by combining truncation with importance reweighting. <div>

Abstract: We study an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO) that, in contrast to most of the existing literature, involves inequality constraints that depend on uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning model. To handle the constraint uncertainty, we use contextual uncertainty sets constructed via methods like conformal prediction. Given a contextual uncertainty set method, we introduce the "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) loss, a feasibility-sensitive adaptation of the SPO loss that measures decision error of predicted objective parameters. We also introduce a convex surrogate, SPO-RC+, and prove Fisher consistency with SPO-RC. To enhance performance, we train on truncated datasets where true constraint parameters lie within the uncertainty sets, and we correct the induced sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques. Through experiments on fractional knapsack and alloy production problem instances, we demonstrate that SPO-RC+ effectively handles uncertainty in constraints and that combining truncation with importance reweighting can further improve performance.

Summary: <br />
This article revisits the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic regret guarantees. It highlights that FTRL can produce "agile" iterates and recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic composition of future costs and linearization of past costs. By comparing FTRL against dynamic comparators, it provides a way to interpolate between greedy and agile updates, offering refined control over regret terms and optimism without cyclic dependence. The analysis shows that it is not the lazy projection style of FTRL hindering dynamic regret, but the decoupling of the algorithm's state from its iterates. Pruning is introduced to synchronize the state and iterates when necessary, allowing for minimal recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. <div>

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However, building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not the lazy projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates, allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two when necessary.

arXiv:2505.22904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational science.

<div> Keywords: unstructured sparsity, KV cache compression, pruning strategies, custom attention kernel, decode performance

Summary:
The study demonstrates that unstructured sparsity significantly enhances KV cache compression for Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving up to 70% sparsity without sacrificing accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. Per-token magnitude-based pruning proves highly effective for both Key and Value caches, surpassing previous structured pruning methods. The Key cache benefits from outlier elements, while the Value cache benefits from simple magnitude-based pruning. KV cache size is a bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead, addressed by a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel. This allows for compressing and computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations. The custom attention kernel and bitmap-based format enable significant compression of KV cache, leading to longer context lengths and increased tokens/sec throughput compared to dense inference. The pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel are accessible at https://github.com/dhjoo98/mustafar<br /><br />Summary: The study highlights the efficacy of unstructured sparsity in improving KV cache compression for LLMs, utilizing per-token magnitude-based pruning for Key and Value caches.

Abstract: We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to dense inference. Our pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel is available at https://github.com/dhjoo98/mustafar.

<br />
Summary: 
This article explores methods for making large language models more memory and parameter efficient during pre-training. It discusses the challenges posed by the increasing size of LLMs and the computational resources required for training and fine-tuning. The study surveys state-of-the-art approaches for efficient pre-training and evaluates several memory efficient methods to determine their performance across various model sizes. The researchers find that full-rank training performs best with the right optimizer and hyperparameters, and that incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches can enhance their performance. Additionally, they propose two practical techniques, weight refactorization and momentum reset, to improve efficient pre-training methods. Applying these techniques to a low-rank model results in lower perplexity than popular memory efficient algorithms while using less memory. <div>
arXiv:2505.22922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets. Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using about 25% less memory.

Summary: <br />
This study questions the necessity of explicit noise-level conditioning in Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) by investigating whether denoisers can infer noise levels implicitly from corrupted graph structures. The research focuses on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extends to more complex scenarios involving structure-attribute noise. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world graph datasets, using models like GDSS and DiGress, show that unconditional GDMs can achieve comparable or better performance than conditioned models. Additionally, unconditional models require fewer parameters (4-6% reduction) and less computation time (8-10% decrease). The results suggest that the inherent high-dimensional nature of graph data may contain enough information for the denoising process, paving the way for simpler and more efficient GDM architectures. <div>
arXiv:2505.22935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler, more efficient GDM architectures.

Summary:
Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are commonly used in various applications such as electronic circuits and neural architectures. While there are effective encoders for DAGs, decoding them poses a challenge due to the multiple topological orders of nodes. This work introduces a grammar-based approach to create a sequential representation of a DAG in a principled and compact manner. The graph is seen as derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique sequence of production rules, enabling lossless compression of the data. This representation has diverse applications, including constructing generative models for graph generation, learning latent spaces for property prediction, and using sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured data. The code for this approach is available on GitHub for further exploration.

arXiv:2505.22949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks, and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured data.

MermaidFlow is a framework that aims to improve the robustness and executability of workflow generation in autonomous agents by redefining the search space through safety-constrained graph evolution. Workflows are represented using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable graph language, to ensure verifiability. Domain-aware evolutionary operators such as crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion are formulated to maintain semantic correctness while enhancing structural diversity. The framework consistently achieves better success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on agent reasoning benchmarks without changing task settings or evaluation protocols. The experimental results highlight the scalability and interpretability of safety-constrained graph evolution in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. <div>
arXiv:2505.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e., crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

Summary: 
The article introduces Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion as a novel approach to enhance reconstructions in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. These solvers utilize a likelihood term to generate data consistent with the posterior distribution. EquiReg improves reconstructions by penalizing diffusion trajectories that deviate from the data manifold, leading to more stable and consistent results compared to current methods relying on isotropic Gaussian approximations. The framework defines a distribution-dependent equivariance error, identifies functions with low error for on-manifold samples, and utilizes these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to various solvers, EquiReg demonstrates superior performance in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations. <div>
arXiv:2505.22973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.

Summary:

- A two-stage optimization approach is proposed to improve the fairness of K-means clustering.
- Two efficient algorithms are developed to identify data points that impact fairness, focusing on nearest outside data points and highly mixed data points.
- Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement in fairness without compromising clustering quality.
- The proposed algorithms can be easily applied to various clustering algorithms and fairness metrics.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.22984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering algorithms or fairness metrics.

Summary: 
PatchEchoClassifier is introduced as an energy-efficient classifier for time-series data, specifically for human activity recognition using sensor signals. The model utilizes an Echo State Network mechanism and a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. It incorporates a knowledge distillation framework to transfer knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight reservoir-based student model. Experimental results show that PatchEchoClassifier achieves over 80% accuracy while reducing computational cost significantly, requiring only a fraction of the FLOPS compared to DeepConvLSTM. These findings highlight PatchEchoClassifier as a promising solution for real-time and energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments. <div>

Abstract: This paper aims to develop an energy-efficient classifier for time-series data by introducing PatchEchoClassifier, a novel model that leverages a reservoir-based mechanism known as the Echo State Network (ESN). The model is designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.

<div> quantization, post-training, linear layers, Hessian, algorithm  
Summary:  
The article introduces a new post-training quantization algorithm, named YAQA, that aims to produce a compressed model with an output distribution close to the original model. Unlike existing methods that focus on minimizing activation error in linear layers independently, YAQA considers the impact of subsequent layers by using Kronecker-factored approximations of each layer's Hessian with respect to the full model KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components: computation of tractable sketches of the full layerwise Hessian and a quantizer-independent rounding algorithm with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The main goal of post-training quantization (PTQ) is to produced a compressed model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as possible. To do this tractably, almost all LLM PTQ algorithms quantize linear layers by independently minimizing the immediate activation error. However, this localized objective ignores the effect of subsequent layers, so reducing it does not necessarily give a closer model. In this work, we introduce Yet Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that uses Kronecker-factored approximations of each linear layer's Hessian with respect to the \textit{full model} KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components: Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical guarantees. Across a wide range of models and quantizers, YAQA empirically reduces the KL divergence to the original model by $\approx 30\%$ while achieving state of the art performance on downstream tasks.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on determining the correct number of clusters in unlabeled datasets using regularized k-means algorithms. The research derives rigorous bounds for the hyperparameter lambda, assuming clusters to be ideal spheres to mimic k-means clusters. It explores both additive and multiplicative regularization functions to reduce ambiguity in finding multiple solutions. Consensus among solutions helps alleviate the issue in certain scenarios. Experiments showcase the algorithm's performance as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach in practical situations where ideal conditions may not hold. The analysis provides valuable insights into hyperparameter selection and the impact of regularizations on clustering outcomes.  <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.22991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and $\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper, we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}. Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions. Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases. We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

<div> neuromodulation, artificial neural networks, conditioning, manifold optimization, generalization<br />
Summary:<br />
The article explores a novel approach inspired by neuromodulation to efficiently learn a range of similar tasks in artificial neural networks. Instead of conditioning a network upon task context by injecting context as input, the proposed method involves learning weights that are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables. This approach optimizes a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology, allowing for improved generalization across tasks. By training manifolds with various topologies and using conditioning to select points on the manifold during inference, the method outperforms traditional conditioning techniques and better generalizes to out-of-distribution samples. This strategy offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning in artificial neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2505.22994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables. Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages. First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks. Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g. noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples. These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) in realistic bargaining scenarios. It presents a benchmark dataset called BargainArena with six complex scenarios to improve strategy modeling. The evaluation metrics are human-aligned and economically grounded, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power to promote opponent-aware reasoning. A structured feedback mechanism allows LLMs to refine their bargaining strategies iteratively and collaborate with in-context learning prompts. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit misaligned negotiation strategies with human preferences, but the structured feedback mechanism improves their performance significantly, fostering deeper strategic reasoning and opponent-awareness. This framework aims to address the challenges LLMs face in understanding and adapting to complex human factors in bargaining interactions.

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that remain effective despite uncertainties in its environment, which frequently arise in real-world applications due to variations in environment dynamics. The robust RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training, but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO, the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these challenges. HYDRO utilizes an online simulator to complement the limited amount of offline datasets in the non-trivial context of robust RL. By measuring and minimizing performance gaps between the simulator and the worst-case models in the uncertainty set, HYDRO employs novel uncertainty filtering and prioritized sampling to select the most relevant and reliable simulator samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate HYDRO's superior performance over existing methods across various tasks, underscoring its potential to improve sample efficiency in offline robust RL.

Summary:
QLIP is introduced as a drop-in replacement for the CLIP vision encoder in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing limitations such as fixed input resolutions and inability to produce separated embeddings for dissimilar images. Two key factors, mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias, are identified as underlying these limitations. QLIP integrates seamlessly with existing MLLMs, enhancing both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding without requiring retraining. It introduces an image quadtree with content-aware patchification to improve visual question answering accuracy in LLaVA v1.5 models, achieving up to a 13.6 percent increase in detailed understanding performance on challenging benchmarks like $V^{\ast}.Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encode images into visual tokens, aligning visual and textual signals within a shared latent space to facilitate crossmodal representation learning. The CLIP model is a widely adopted foundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical role in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision encoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only handling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings for dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model typically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often necessitates retraining the entire model pipeline.
  In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the CLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias. To address these issues, we propose QLIP, a drop-in replacement for CLIP that can be seamlessly integrated with existing MLLMs with only a few lines of code and can enhance both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding, without re-training. QLIP is designed around an image quadtree which replaces the standard uniform grid patches with a novel content aware patchification. Our experimental results demonstrate that QLIP improves the general visual question answering accuracy of the LLaVA v1.5 model series across various model sizes--without requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the full MLLM. Notably, QLIP boosts detailed understanding performance on the challenging $V^{\ast}$ benchmark by up to 13.6 percent.

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions. Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation, making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645 diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems, such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval, demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences. Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment and a high correlation with human preferences.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on enhancing the generalizability of large language models (LLMs) by controlling model complexity through adjustments in initialization rate and weight decay coefficient. The researchers demonstrate that by effectively managing model complexity, LLMs show improved scaling laws across various model sizes and data sizes. Comparing benchmark performances of LLMs pretrained on 1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters, the study highlights the benefits of constant initialization rates for faster scaling law descent. This approach suggests that complexity control is a promising avenue for advancing LLM capabilities in a more reliable manner. <div>
arXiv:2505.23013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly advancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches that can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on 1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes. These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the continual advancement of LLMs.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a novel approach to graph neural networks by formulating message passing as a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs). By mapping node representations into a solution space spanned by eigenvectors describing the topological structure of graphs, the system allows for the decomposition of node features into a superposition of these eigenvectors, enhancing interpretability and extracting fundamental characteristics of the topology. The use of hyperbolic PDEs also establishes a connection with spectral graph neural networks, improving their performance across various graph tasks. Additionally, the introduction of polynomials to approximate filter functions enhances flexibility and further boosts the effectiveness of spectral GNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the strong performance and flexibility of this hyperbolic PDE paradigm in improving spectral GNNs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) leverage message passing mechanisms to learn the topological features of graph data. Traditional GNNs learns node features in a spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological features. In this paper, we formulates message passing as a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs), constituting a dynamical system that explicitly maps node representations into a particular solution space. This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse graph tasks.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems prioritize maximum throughput. They often neglect Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT), which leads to suboptimal SLO attainment. This paper introduces SCORPIO, an SLO-oriented LLM serving system designed to maximize system goodput and SLO attainment for workloads with heterogeneous SLOs. Our core insight is to exploit SLO heterogeneity for adaptive scheduling across admission control, queue management, and batch selection. SCORPIO features a TTFT Guard, which employs least-deadline-first reordering and rejects unattainable requests, and a TPOT Guard, which utilizes a VBS-based admission control and a novel credit-based batching mechanism. Both guards are supported by a predictive module. Evaluations demonstrate that SCORPIO improves system goodput by up to 14.4X and SLO adherence by up to 46.5% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the challenge of subpopulation shift in machine learning models and proposes a novel solution using Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs). Traditional methods rely on re-weighting strategies based on assumptions about subpopulations, which may not be feasible for many real-world datasets. DPEs involve using an ensemble of diverse classifiers that focus on different features and samples, thus adapting to the risk associated with subpopulations. By replacing the linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical classifiers in a feature extractor network, DPEs outperform prior approaches in worst-group accuracy on nine real-world datasets. This method shows promising results in addressing subpopulation shift without the need for explicit annotations of group membership. <div>
arXiv:2505.23027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead, we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy.

arXiv:2505.23032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning. Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable, uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have inspired the development of foundation models across various domains. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of Large EEG Models (LEMs) by fine-tuning LaBraM, a state-of-the-art foundation EEG model, on a real-world stress classification dataset collected in a graduate classroom. Unlike previous studies that primarily evaluate LEMs using data from controlled clinical settings, our work assesses their applicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that distinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG data recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The best-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a 5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in both accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of the fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts. These results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process real-world EEG data and highlight their potential to revolutionize brain-computer interface applications by shifting the focus from model-centric to data-centric design.

Abstract: Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios. Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>DenoiseRotator: Enhance Pruning Robustness for LLMs via Importance Concentration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23049</link>

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs) by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective: rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator, which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are available at https://github.com/Axel-gu/DenoiseRotator.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\% (synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM prompting approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point improvement over unconstrained inference

<title>Composite Flow Matching for Reinforcement Learning with Shifted-Dynamics Data</title>

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions. Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.

Abstract: Crop disease detection and classification is a critical challenge in agriculture, with major implications for productivity, food security, and environmental sustainability. While deep learning models such as CNN and ViT have shown excellent performance in classifying plant diseases from images, their large-scale deployment is often limited by data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue, but centralized FL remains vulnerable to single-point failures and scalability limits. In this paper, we introduce a novel Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework that uses validation loss (Loss_val) both to guide model sharing between peers and to correct local training via an adaptive loss function controlled by weighting parameter. We conduct extensive experiments using PlantVillage datasets with three deep learning architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT_B16), analyzing the impact of weighting parameter, the number of shared models, the number of clients, and the use of Loss_val versus Loss_train of other clients. Results demonstrate that our DFL approach not only improves accuracy and convergence speed, but also ensures better generalization and robustness across heterogeneous data environments making it particularly well-suited for privacy-preserving agricultural applications.

<title>Multi-Modal Learning with Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration</title>

arXiv:2505.23071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) integrates information from diverse modalities to improve predictive accuracy. However, existing methods mainly aggregate gradients with fixed weights and treat all dimensions equally, overlooking the intrinsic gradient uncertainty of each modality. This may lead to (i) excessive updates in sensitive dimensions, degrading performance, and (ii) insufficient updates in less sensitive dimensions, hindering learning. To address this issue, we propose BOGC-MML, a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for MML to explicitly model the gradient uncertainty and guide the model optimization towards the optimal direction. Specifically, we first model each modality's gradient as a random variable and derive its probability distribution, capturing the full uncertainty in the gradient space. Then, we propose an effective method that converts the precision (inverse variance) of each gradient distribution into a scalar evidence. This evidence quantifies the confidence of each modality in every gradient dimension. Using these evidences, we explicitly quantify per-dimension uncertainties and fuse them via a reduced Dempster-Shafer rule. The resulting uncertainty-weighted aggregation produces a calibrated update direction that balances sensitivity and conservatism across dimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid framework combining LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks with LightGBM and CatBoost for stock price prediction. The framework processes time-series financial data and evaluates performance using seven models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), vanilla LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and standard Neural Networks (NNs). Key metrics, including MAE, R-squared, MSE, and RMSE, are used to establish benchmarks across different time scales.
  Building on these benchmarks, we develop an ensemble model that combines the strengths of sequential and tree-based approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves accuracy by 10 to 15 percent compared to individual models and reduces error during market changes. This study highlights the potential of ensemble methods for financial forecasting and provides a flexible design for integrating new machine learning techniques.

Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations, thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

arXiv:2505.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive, hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components. However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing future PEFT methods.

arXiv:2505.23098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive variable neighborhood search (RL-AVNS) method designed for effectively solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Time Windows (VRPMTW). Unlike traditional adaptive approaches that rely solely on historical operator performance, our method integrates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically select neighborhood operators based on real-time solution states and learned experience. We introduce a fitness metric that quantifies customers' temporal flexibility to improve the shaking phase, and employ a transformer-based neural policy network to intelligently guide operator selection during the local search. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on realistic scenarios derived from the replenishment of unmanned vending machines, characterized by multiple clustered replenishment windows. Results demonstrate that RL-AVNS significantly outperforms traditional variable neighborhood search (VNS), adaptive VNS (AVNS), and state-of-the-art learning-based heuristics, achieving substantial improvements in solution quality and computational efficiency across various instance scales and time window complexities. Particularly notable is the algorithm's capability to generalize effectively to problem instances not encountered during training, underscoring its practical utility for complex logistics scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact, suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed fine-tuning.

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach, while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs -- a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO) in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space. As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable, and efficient physics learning. Our code and data accompanying this paper are available at https://github.com/fishmoon1234/Nonlocal-Attention-Operator.

Abstract: Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting. In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements. Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module. Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in for various forecasting tasks across different domains. Codes are available at https://github.com/mumiao2000/CrossLinear.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale training, model merging has evolved into a tool for creating multitasking models efficiently. It enables the knowledge of models to be fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional multitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa, encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B. Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings. Moreover, our analysis reveals renormalization as the crucial component for creating a robust and even joint space for merging, significantly contributing to the method's performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of assigning operations in a dataflow graph to devices to minimize execution time in a work-conserving system, with emphasis on complex machine learning workloads. Prior learning-based methods often struggle due to three key limitations: (1) reliance on bulk-synchronous systems like TensorFlow, which under-utilize devices due to barrier synchronization; (2) lack of awareness of the scheduling mechanism of underlying systems when designing learning-based methods; and (3) exclusive dependence on reinforcement learning, ignoring the structure of effective heuristics designed by experts. In this paper, we propose \textsc{Doppler}, a three-stage framework for training dual-policy networks consisting of 1) a $\mathsf{SEL}$ policy for selecting operations and 2) a $\mathsf{PLC}$ policy for placing chosen operations on devices. Our experiments show that \textsc{Doppler} outperforms all baseline methods across tasks by reducing system execution time and additionally demonstrates sampling efficiency by reducing per-episode training time.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment -- offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs' benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current benchmarks often lack support for end-to-end verifiable code generation. In this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code, specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, generates only 61.4% correct code, 51.0% sound and complete specifications, and 3.6% successful proofs, with one trial per task. We hope Verina will catalyze progress in verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark. We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina and our evaluation code on https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/verina.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that, despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.

Abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in real-world scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result for adaptive algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between online and offline distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H algorithm, which introduces adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an auxiliary bias correction to balance offline and online data within the LUCB framework. Theoretical analysis shows that LUCB-H matches the sample complexity of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading and significantly outperforms it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an instance-dependent lower bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain scenarios. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of LUCB-H in effectively incorporating offline data.

<title>Pseudo Multi-Source Domain Generalization: Bridging the Gap Between Single and Multi-Source Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on data distributions different from their training data, particularly in real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in more practical Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be used with existing MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/PseudoDomainBed.

<title>The Panaceas for Improving Low-Rank Decomposition in Communication-Efficient Federated Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the training efficiency of federated learning (FL), previous research has employed low-rank decomposition techniques to reduce communication overhead. In this paper, we seek to enhance the performance of these low-rank decomposition methods. Specifically, we focus on three key issues related to decomposition in FL: what to decompose, how to decompose, and how to aggregate. Subsequently, we introduce three novel techniques: Model Update Decomposition (MUD), Block-wise Kronecker Decomposition (BKD), and Aggregation-Aware Decomposition (AAD), each targeting a specific issue. These techniques are complementary and can be applied simultaneously to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the convergence of the proposed MUD. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves faster convergence and superior accuracy compared to relevant baseline methods.

<title>FreRA: A Frequency-Refined Augmentation for Contrastive Learning on Time Series Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23181</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components. Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios across diverse datasets.

<title>FSL-SAGE: Accelerating Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation Gradient Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data. However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

<title>Two Is Better Than One: Rotations Scale LoRAs</title>

Abstract: Scaling Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) facilitates large language models (LLMs) to efficiently adapt to diverse tasks. However, traditional gating mechanisms that route inputs to the best experts may fundamentally hinder LLMs' scalability, leading to poor generalization and underfitting issues. We identify that the root cause lies in the restricted expressiveness of existing weighted-sum mechanisms, both within and outside the convex cone of LoRA representations. This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a novel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational operations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate richer feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs. Specifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a learnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix involves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship between LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an extra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and properly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues as the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks across 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We also provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of representations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically similar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing distance ones further apart. We will release our code to the community.

Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Beyond Zero Initialization: Investigating the Impact of Non-Zero Initialization on LoRA Fine-Tuning Dynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. In standard LoRA layers, one of the matrices, $A$ or $B$, is initialized to zero, ensuring that fine-tuning starts from the pretrained model. However, there is no theoretical support for this practice. In this paper, we investigate the impact of non-zero initialization on LoRA's fine-tuning dynamics from an infinite-width perspective. Our analysis reveals that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$ to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates, particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance. In other words, fine-tuning does not need to strictly start from the pretrained model. The validity of our findings is confirmed through extensive experiments across various models and datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Leopold1423/non_zero_lora-icml25.

<title>Less is More: Unlocking Specialization of Time Series Foundation Models via Structured Pruning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This "prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to identify which training examples influence a model's predictions on specific test data most. By quantifying these influences, TDA supports critical applications such as data debugging, curation, and valuation. Gradient-based TDA methods rely on gradients and second-order information, limiting their applicability at scale. While recent random projection-based methods improve scalability, they often suffer from degraded attribution accuracy. Motivated by connections between uncertainty and influence functions, we introduce Daunce - a simple yet effective data attribution approach through uncertainty estimation. Our method operates by fine-tuning a collection of perturbed models and computing the covariance of per-example losses across these models as the attribution score. Daunce is scalable to large language models (LLMs) and achieves more accurate attribution compared to existing TDA methods. We validate Daunce on tasks ranging from vision tasks to LLM fine-tuning, and further demonstrate its compatibility with black-box model access. Applied to OpenAI's GPT models, our method achieves, to our knowledge, the first instance of data attribution on proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between model generalization and counterfactual explainability in supervised learning. We introduce the notion of $\varepsilon$-valid counterfactual probability ($\varepsilon$-VCP) -- the probability of finding perturbations of a data point within its $\varepsilon$-neighborhood that result in a label change. We provide a theoretical analysis of $\varepsilon$-VCP in relation to the geometry of the model's decision boundary, showing that $\varepsilon$-VCP tends to increase with model overfitting. Our findings establish a rigorous connection between poor generalization and the ease of counterfactual generation, revealing an inherent trade-off between generalization and counterfactual explainability. Empirical results validate our theory, suggesting $\varepsilon$-VCP as a practical proxy for quantitatively characterizing overfitting.

Abstract: The rapid growth in feature dimension may introduce implicit associations between features and labels in multi-label datasets, making the relationships between features and labels increasingly complex. Moreover, existing methods often adopt low-dimensional linear decomposition to explore the associations between features and labels. However, linear decomposition struggles to capture complex nonlinear associations and may lead to misalignment between the feature space and the label space. To address these two critical challenges, we propose innovative solutions. First, we design a random walk graph that integrates feature-feature, label-label, and feature-label relationships to accurately capture nonlinear and implicit indirect associations, while optimizing the latent representations of associations between features and labels after low-rank decomposition. Second, we align the variable spaces by leveraging low-dimensional representation coefficients, while preserving the manifold structure between the original high-dimensional multi-label data and the low-dimensional representation space. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on seven benchmark datasets and three representative datasets using various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method\footnote{Code: https://github.com/Heilong623/-GRW-}.

Abstract: Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients, natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state value functions rather than state-control value functions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing their data. Measuring participant contributions in FL is crucial for incentivizing clients and ensuring transparency. While various methods have been proposed for contribution measurement, they are designed exclusively for centralized federated learning (CFL), where a central server collects and aggregates client models, along with evaluating their contributions. Meanwhile, decentralized federated learning (DFL), in which clients exchange models directly without a central server, has gained significant attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating a single point of failure. However, applying existing contribution measurement methods to DFL is challenging due to the presence of multiple global models and the absence of a central server. In this study, we present novel methodologies for measuring participant contributions in DFL. We first propose DFL-Shapley, an extension of the Shapley value tailored for DFL, adapting this widely used CFL metric to decentralized settings. Given the impracticality of computing the ideal DFL-Shapley in real-world systems, we introduce DFL-MR, a computable approximation that estimates overall contributions by accumulating round-wise Shapley values. We evaluate DFL-Shapley and DFL-MR across various FL scenarios and compare them with existing CFL metrics. The experimental results confirm DFL-Shapley as a valid ground-truth metric and demonstrate DFL-MR's proximity to DFL-Shapley across various settings, highlighting their effectiveness as contribution metrics in DFL.

<title>Accelerating RLHF Training with Reward Variance Increase</title>

arXiv:2505.23247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Recent Diffusion models (DMs) advancements have explored incorporating the second-order diffusion Fisher information (DF), defined as the negative Hessian of log density, into various downstream tasks and theoretical analysis. However, current practices typically approximate the diffusion Fisher by applying auto-differentiation to the learned score network. This black-box method, though straightforward, lacks any accuracy guarantee and is time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the diffusion Fisher actually resides within a space spanned by the outer products of score and initial data. Based on the outer-product structure, we develop two efficient approximation algorithms to access the trace and matrix-vector multiplication of DF, respectively. These algorithms bypass the auto-differentiation operations with time-efficient vector-product calculations. Furthermore, we establish the approximation error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Experiments in likelihood evaluation and adjoint optimization demonstrate the superior accuracy and reduced computational cost of our proposed algorithms. Additionally, based on the novel outer-product formulation of DF, we design the first numerical verification experiment for the optimal transport property of the general PF-ODE deduced map.

<title>Does Machine Unlearning Truly Remove Model Knowledge? A Framework for Auditing Unlearning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies. To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Abstract: Land cover and land use (LULC) changes are key applications of satellite imagery, and they have critical roles in resource management, urbanization, protection of soils and the environment, and enhancing sustainable development. The literature has heavily utilized multispectral spatiotemporal satellite data alongside advanced machine learning algorithms to monitor and predict LULC changes. This study analyzes and compares LULC changes across various governorates (provinces) of the Sultanate of Oman from 2016 to 2021 using annual time steps. For the chosen region, multispectral spatiotemporal data were acquired from the open-source Sentinel-2 satellite dataset. Supervised machine learning algorithms were used to train and classify different land covers, such as water bodies, crops, urban, etc. The constructed model was subsequently applied within the study region, allowing for an effective comparative evaluation of LULC changes within the given timeframe.

Abstract: Determining conditional independence (CI) relationships between random variables is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and statistics, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing generative model-based CI testing methods, such as those utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs), often struggle with undesirable modeling of conditional distributions and training instability, resulting in subpar performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel CI testing method via score-based generative modeling, which achieves precise Type I error control and strong testing power. Concretely, we first employ a sliced conditional score matching scheme to accurately estimate conditional score and use Langevin dynamics conditional sampling to generate null hypothesis samples, ensuring precise Type I error control. Then, we incorporate a goodness-of-fit stage into the method to verify generated samples and enhance interpretability in practice. We theoretically establish the error bound of conditional distributions modeled by score-based generative models and prove the validity of our CI tests. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a promising way to revitalize generative model-based CI testing.

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on categorical data.

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of deep learning on text, audio, and image datasets, its dominance in tabular data, especially in the medical domain where data are often scarce, remains less clear. In this paper, we propose X2Graph, a novel deep learning method that achieves strong performance on small biological tabular datasets. X2Graph leverages external knowledge about the relationships between table columns, such as gene interactions, to convert each sample into a graph structure. This transformation enables the application of standard message passing algorithms for graph modeling. Our X2Graph method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing tree-based and deep learning methods across three cancer subtyping datasets.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric. We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA benchmark.

<title>Graph Positional Autoencoders as Self-supervised Learners</title>

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders (GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability. Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements, such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders (GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

<title>Sentinel: Scheduling Live Streams with Proactive Anomaly Detection in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms</title>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by 74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.

<title>Towards Reward Fairness in RLHF: From a Resource Allocation Perspective</title>

Abstract: Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a more fair manner.

<title>Grower-in-the-Loop Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Greenhouse Climate Control</title>

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions. Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However, interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs, achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast, reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect inputs.

Abstract: Dynamic Spectral Backpropagation (DSBP) enhances neural network training under resource constraints by projecting gradients onto principal eigenvectors, reducing complexity and promoting flat minima. Five extensions are proposed, dynamic spectral inference, spectral architecture optimization, spectral meta learning, spectral transfer regularization, and Lie algebra inspired dynamics, to address challenges in robustness, fewshot learning, and hardware efficiency. Supported by a third order stochastic differential equation (SDE) and a PAC Bayes limit, DSBP outperforms Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) on CIFAR 10, Fashion MNIST, MedMNIST, and Tiny ImageNet, as demonstrated through extensive experiments and visualizations. Future work focuses on scalability, bias mitigation, and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest performance.

Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments. With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interoperability of modeling. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the model formulation, evaluation, and refinement, facilitating model discovery. We evaluate two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks achieve R^2 values close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover, on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors, offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.

<title>OTPTO: Joint Product Selection and Inventory Optimization in Fresh E-commerce Front-End Warehouses</title>

Abstract: In China's competitive fresh e-commerce market, optimizing operational strategies, especially inventory management in front-end warehouses, is key to enhance customer satisfaction and to gain a competitive edge. Front-end warehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of fresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of deciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account capacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize (PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align prediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer satisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task Optimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes product selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer satisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs a 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal inventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking model PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a post-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh platform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO method. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances the full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and narrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These findings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at front-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step. Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy. To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to DACER.

Abstract: Depression is a debilitating mood disorder negatively impacting millions worldwide. While researchers have explored multiple verbal and non-verbal behavioural cues for automated depression assessment, head motion has received little attention thus far. Further, the common practice of validating machine learning models via a single dataset can limit model generalisability. This work examines the effectiveness and generalisability of models utilising elementary head motion units, termed kinemes, for depression severity estimation. Specifically, we consider three depression datasets from different western cultures (German: AVEC2013, Australian: Blackdog and American: Pitt datasets) with varied contextual and recording settings to investigate the generalisability of the derived kineme patterns via two methods: (i) k-fold cross-validation over individual/multiple datasets, and (ii) model reuse on other datasets. Evaluating classification and regression performance with classical machine learning methods, our results show that: (1) head motion patterns are efficient biomarkers for estimating depression severity, achieving highly competitive performance for both classification and regression tasks on a variety of datasets, including achieving the second best Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the AVEC2013 dataset, and (2) kineme-based features are more generalisable than (a) raw head motion descriptors for binary severity classification, and (b) other visual behavioural cues for severity estimation (regression).

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models. This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples. Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5 percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while generating more diverse and robust solutions.

Abstract: Ranking systems influence decision-making in high-stakes domains like health, education, and employment, where they can have substantial economic and social impacts. This makes the integration of safety mechanisms essential. One such mechanism is $\textit{abstention}$, which enables algorithmic decision-making system to defer uncertain or low-confidence decisions to human experts. While abstention have been predominantly explored in the context of classification tasks, its application to other machine learning paradigms remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for abstention in pairwise learning-to-rank tasks. Our approach is based on thresholding the ranker's conditional risk: the system abstains from making a decision when the estimated risk exceeds a predefined threshold. Our contributions are threefold: a theoretical characterization of the optimal abstention strategy, a model-agnostic, plug-in algorithm for constructing abstaining ranking models, and a comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential. This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Abstract: In strategic classification, the standard supervised learning setting is extended to support the notion of strategic user behavior in the form of costly feature manipulations made in response to a classifier. While standard learning supports a broad range of model classes, the study of strategic classification has, so far, been dedicated mostly to linear classifiers. This work aims to expand the horizon by exploring how strategic behavior manifests under non-linear classifiers and what this implies for learning. We take a bottom-up approach showing how non-linearity affects decision boundary points, classifier expressivity, and model classes complexity. A key finding is that universal approximators (e.g., neural nets) are no longer universal once the environment is strategic. We demonstrate empirically how this can create performance gaps even on an unrestricted model class.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: At the core of reinforcement learning is the idea of learning beyond the performance in the data. However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.

Abstract: Ensuring convergence of policy gradient methods in federated reinforcement learning (FRL) under environment heterogeneity remains a major challenge. In this work, we first establish that heterogeneity, perhaps counter-intuitively, can necessitate optimal policies to be non-deterministic or even time-varying, even in tabular environments. Subsequently, we prove global convergence results for federated policy gradient (FedPG) algorithms employing local updates, under a {\L}ojasiewicz condition that holds only for each individual agent, in both entropy-regularized and non-regularized scenarios. Crucially, our theoretical analysis shows that FedPG attains linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, a property central to efficient federated learning. Leveraging insights from our theoretical findings, we introduce b-RS-FedPG, a novel policy gradient method that employs a carefully constructed softmax-inspired parameterization coupled with an appropriate regularization scheme. We further demonstrate explicit convergence rates for b-RS-FedPG toward near-optimal stationary policies. Finally, we demonstrate that empirically both FedPG and b-RS-FedPG consistently outperform federated Q-learning on heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) significantly reduces human effort for labeling data by combining the outputs of user-provided labeling functions (LFs) on unlabeled datapoints. However, the quality of the generated labels depends directly on the accuracy of the LFs. In this work, we study the problem of fixing LFs based on a small set of labeled examples. Towards this goal, we develop novel techniques for repairing a set of LFs by minimally changing their results on the labeled examples such that the fixed LFs ensure that (i) there is sufficient evidence for the correct label of each labeled datapoint and (ii) the accuracy of each repaired LF is sufficiently high. We model LFs as conditional rules which enables us to refine them, i.e., to selectively change their output for some inputs. We demonstrate experimentally that our system improves the quality of LFs based on surprisingly small sets of labeled datapoints.

<title>SGD as Free Energy Minimization: A Thermodynamic View on Neural Network Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23489</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic interpretation of the stationary behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under fixed learning rates (LRs) in neural network training. We show that SGD implicitly minimizes a free energy function $F=U-TS$, balancing training loss $U$ and the entropy of the weights distribution $S$, with temperature $T$ determined by the LR. This perspective offers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss minima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We empirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP) and overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy minimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP models, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to minimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum. We attribute this mismatch to differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradients near optima, supported by both a toy example and neural network experiments.

<title>Epistemic Errors of Imperfect Multitask Learners When Distributions Shift</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic, decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i) consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within $\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.

<title>Why Machine Learning Models Fail to Fully Capture Epistemic Uncertainty</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years various supervised learning methods that disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on second-order distributions have been proposed. We argue that these methods fail to capture critical components of epistemic uncertainty, particularly due to the often-neglected component of model bias. To show this, we make use of a more fine-grained taxonomy of epistemic uncertainty sources in machine learning models, and analyse how the classical bias-variance decomposition of the expected prediction error can be decomposed into different parts reflecting these uncertainties. By using a simulation-based evaluation protocol which encompasses epistemic uncertainty due to both procedural- and data-driven uncertainty components, we illustrate that current methods rarely capture the full spectrum of epistemic uncertainty. Through theoretical insights and synthetic experiments, we show that high model bias can lead to misleadingly low estimates of epistemic uncertainty, and common second-order uncertainty quantification methods systematically blur bias-induced errors into aleatoric estimates, thereby underrepresenting epistemic uncertainty. Our findings underscore that meaningful aleatoric estimates are feasible only if all relevant sources of epistemic uncertainty are properly represented.

<title>AnchorAttention: Difference-Aware Sparse Attention with Stripe Granularity</title>

arXiv:2505.23520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths face significant computational challenges during the pre-filling phase, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing methods typically employ dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However, their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware, dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention comprises three key components: (1) \textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation}, leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \textbf{Difference-aware Stripe Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation}, replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained sparsity strategy, \textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, at a text length of 128k, it achieves a speedup of 1.44$\times$ while maintaining higher recall rates.

<title>Accelerating AllReduce with a Persistent Straggler</title>

arXiv:2505.23523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed machine learning workloads use data and tensor parallelism for training and inference, both of which rely on the AllReduce collective to synchronize gradients or activations. However, bulk-synchronous AllReduce algorithms can be delayed by a persistent straggler that is slower to reach the synchronization barrier required to begin the collective. To address this challenge, we propose StragglAR: an AllReduce algorithm that accelerates distributed training and inference in the presence of persistent stragglers. StragglAR implements a ReduceScatter among the remaining GPUs during the straggler-induced delay, and then executes a novel collective algorithm to complete the AllReduce once the straggler reaches the synchronization barrier. StragglAR achieves a 2x theoretical speedup over popular bandwidth-efficient AllReduce algorithms (e.g., Ring) for large GPU clusters with persistent stragglers. On an 8-GPU server, our implementation of StragglAR yields a 22% speedup over state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms.

<title>Normalizing Flows are Capable Models for RL</title>

arXiv:2505.23527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and unsupervised RL.

<title>Comparative assessment of fairness definitions and bias mitigation strategies in machine learning-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from MR images</title>

Abstract: The present study performs a comprehensive fairness analysis of machine learning (ML) models for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI-derived neuroimaging features. Biases associated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the influence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are investigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in the identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most appropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies is performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the trade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the equalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic applications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to age and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed mitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across the different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and gender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%, respectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI versus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial debiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic mean score of 0.69. Insights are provided into how variations in AD neuropathology and risk factors, associated with demographic characteristics, influence model fairness.

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM, which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function, but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures. Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical performance guarantees.

Abstract: This paper investigates the comparative performance of two fundamental approaches to solving linear regression problems: the closed-form Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and the iterative gradient descent method. Linear regression is a cornerstone of predictive modeling, and the choice of solver can significantly impact efficiency and accuracy. I review and discuss the theoretical underpinnings of both methods, analyze their computational complexity, and evaluate their empirical behavior on synthetic datasets with controlled characteristics, as well as on established real-world datasets. My results delineate the conditions under which each method excels in terms of computational time, numerical stability, and predictive accuracy. This work aims to provide practical guidance for researchers and practitioners in machine learning when selecting between direct, exact solutions and iterative, approximate solutions for linear regression tasks.

Abstract: Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency, particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

<title>Segment Policy Optimization: Effective Segment-Level Credit Assignment in RL for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities: Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g., GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward, leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods, enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT, featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

arXiv:2505.23569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.

Abstract: Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction - where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction, BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from genomic data. Data, code, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/BioReason

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts, missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision. Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and significantly improves forecasting reliability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is provided at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/opo.

Abstract: This paper explores second-order optimization methods in Federated Learning (FL), addressing the critical challenges of slow convergence and the excessive communication rounds required to achieve optimal performance from the global model. While existing surveys in FL primarily focus on challenges related to statistical and device label heterogeneity, as well as privacy and security concerns in first-order FL methods, less attention has been given to the issue of slow model training. This slow training often leads to the need for excessive communication rounds or increased communication costs, particularly when data across clients are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we examine various FL methods that leverage second-order optimization to accelerate the training process. We provide a comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art second-order FL methods and compare their performance based on convergence speed, computational cost, memory usage, transmission overhead, and generalization of the global model. Our findings show the potential of incorporating Hessian curvature through second-order optimization into FL and highlight key challenges, such as the efficient utilization of Hessian and its inverse in FL. This work lays the groundwork for future research aimed at developing scalable and efficient federated optimization methods for improving the training of the global model in FL.

Abstract: Post-training of foundation language models has emerged as a promising research domain in federated learning (FL) with the goal to enable privacy-preserving model improvements and adaptations to user's downstream tasks. Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various aspects of openness and their implications for FL.

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognise and solve tasks which have been obfuscated beyond recognition. Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers, and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and interpretability issues for automated software systems.

<title>On Transferring Transferability: Towards a Theory for Size Generalization</title>

Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.

<title>Muddit: Liberating Generation Beyond Text-to-Image with a Unified Discrete Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power grids to smart grids, significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, and soaring electricity prices has triggered a digital transformation of the energy infrastructure that enables new, data driven, applications often supported by machine learning models. However, the majority of the developed machine learning models rely on univariate data. To date, a structured study considering the role meta-data and additional measurements resulting in multivariate data is missing. In this paper we propose a taxonomy that identifies and structures various types of data related to energy applications. The taxonomy can be used to guide application specific data model development for training machine learning models. Focusing on a household electricity forecasting application, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy in guiding the selection of the features for various types of models. As such, we study of the effect of domain, contextual and behavioral features on the forecasting accuracy of four interpretable machine learning techniques and three openly available datasets. Finally, using a feature importance techniques, we explain individual feature contributions to the forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings, generalizing the Skew Spectrum of graphs of Kondor & Borgwardt (2008). Grounded in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between computational complexity and expressivity. By applying generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.

Abstract: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models. Project page at diffusion-inference-scaling.github.io.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) achieve outstanding performance in many domains; however, their decision processes are often opaque and their inference can be computationally expensive in resource-constrained environments. We recently proposed Differentiable Logic Networks (DLNs) to address these issues for tabular classification based on relaxing discrete logic into a differentiable form, thereby enabling gradient-based learning of networks built from binary logic operations. DLNs offer interpretable reasoning and substantially lower inference cost.
  We extend the DLN framework to supervised tabular regression. Specifically, we redesign the final output layer to support continuous targets and unify the original two-phase training procedure into a single differentiable stage. We evaluate the resulting model on 15 public regression benchmarks, comparing it with modern neural networks and classical regression baselines. Regression DLNs match or exceed baseline accuracy while preserving interpretability and fast inference. Our results show that DLNs are a viable, cost-effective alternative for regression tasks, especially where model transparency and computational efficiency are important.

Abstract: Identifying mistakes (i.e., miscues) made while reading aloud is commonly approached post-hoc by comparing automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcriptions to the target reading text. However, post-hoc methods perform poorly when ASR inaccurately transcribes verbatim speech. To improve on current methods for reading error annotation, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture that incorporates the target reading text via prompting and is trained for both improved verbatim transcription and direct miscue detection. Our contributions include: first, demonstrating that incorporating reading text through prompting benefits verbatim transcription performance over fine-tuning, and second, showing that it is feasible to augment speech recognition tasks for end-to-end miscue detection. We conducted two case studies -- children's read-aloud and adult atypical speech -- and found that our proposed strategies improve verbatim transcription and miscue detection compared to current state-of-the-art.

<title>MCP Safety Training: Learning to Refuse Falsely Benign MCP Exploits using Improved Preference Alignment</title>

arXiv:2505.23634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks (FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims' systems.
  To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.

arXiv:2505.23640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown potential as a powerful and data-efficient tool for neural architecture search (NAS). Most existing graph BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However, the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.

arXiv:2505.23648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex. Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation. However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

<title>How does Transformer Learn Implicit Reasoning?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization, followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh. Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.

<title>Bayesian Optimization from Human Feedback: Near-Optimal Regret Bounds</title>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) with preference-based feedback has recently garnered significant attention due to its emerging applications. We refer to this problem as Bayesian Optimization from Human Feedback (BOHF), which differs from conventional BO by learning the best actions from a reduced feedback model, where only the preference between two actions is revealed to the learner at each time step. The objective is to identify the best action using a limited number of preference queries, typically obtained through costly human feedback. Existing work, which adopts the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) feedback model, provides regret bounds for the performance of several algorithms. In this work, within the same framework we develop tighter performance guarantees. Specifically, we derive regret bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma(T)T})$, where $\Gamma(T)$ represents the maximum information gain$\unicode{x2014}$a kernel-specific complexity term$\unicode{x2014}$and $T$ is the number of queries. Our results significantly improve upon existing bounds. Notably, for common kernels, we show that the order-optimal sample complexities of conventional BO$\unicode{x2014}$achieved with richer feedback models$\unicode{x2014}$are recovered. In other words, the same number of preferential samples as scalar-valued samples is sufficient to find a nearly optimal solution.

Abstract: Neural network minima are often connected by curves along which train and test loss remain nearly constant, a phenomenon known as mode connectivity. While this property has enabled applications such as model merging and fine-tuning, its theoretical explanation remains unclear. We propose a new approach to exploring the connectedness of minima using parameter space symmetry. By linking the topology of symmetry groups to that of the minima, we derive the number of connected components of the minima of linear networks and show that skip connections reduce this number. We then examine when mode connectivity and linear mode connectivity hold or fail, using parameter symmetries which account for a significant part of the minimum. Finally, we provide explicit expressions for connecting curves in the minima induced by symmetry. Using the curvature of these curves, we derive conditions under which linear mode connectivity approximately holds. Our findings highlight the role of continuous symmetries in understanding the neural network loss landscape.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Prior theoretical work exploring the expressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform multi-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the learnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data distribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization, remains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we study the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires computing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden permutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\log k)$ layers. On the negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that any SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for the $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in $k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we show that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and sample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\log k)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in which data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \le k$ presented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is presented simultaneously. Our work sheds light on the necessity and sufficiency of having both easy and hard examples in the data distribution for transformers to learn complex compositional tasks.

Abstract: Solving systems of polynomial equations, particularly those with finitely many solutions, is a crucial challenge across many scientific fields. Traditional methods like Gr\"obner and Border bases are fundamental but suffer from high computational costs, which have motivated recent Deep Learning approaches to improve efficiency, albeit at the expense of output correctness. In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which reduces the number of tokens to encode an $n$-variate polynomial by a factor of $O(n)$. Our learning approach is data efficient, stable, and a practical enhancement to traditional computer algebra algorithms and symbolic computation.

arXiv:2505.23700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations play a pivotal role in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by offering intuitive, human-understandable alternatives that elucidate machine learning model decisions. Despite their significance, existing methods for generating counterfactuals often require constant access to the predictive model, involve computationally intensive optimization for each instance and lack the flexibility to adapt to new user-defined constraints without retraining. In this paper, we propose DiCoFlex, a novel model-agnostic, conditional generative framework that produces multiple diverse counterfactuals in a single forward pass. Leveraging conditional normalizing flows trained solely on labeled data, DiCoFlex addresses key limitations by enabling real-time user-driven customization of constraints such as sparsity and actionability at inference time. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity, diversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and scalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making domains.

arXiv:2505.23702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce (U)NFV, a modular neural network architecture that generalizes classical finite volume (FV) methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve, particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

<title>TiRex: Zero-Shot Forecasting Across Long and Short Horizons with Enhanced In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.

<title>COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents, where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward. Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance, consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success through the application of models traditionally built for natural language processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.

<title>SC-LoRA: Balancing Efficient Fine-tuning and Knowledge Preservation via Subspace-Constrained LoRA</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23724</link>

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

Abstract: DiLoCo is a powerful framework for training large language models (LLMs) under networking constraints with advantages for increasing parallelism and accelerator utilization in data center settings. Despite significantly reducing communication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve all-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works have explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error feedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of standard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization for reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local optimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only transformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner optimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to aggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no performance degradation. Crucially, MuLoCo (Muon inner optimizer DiLoCo) significantly outperforms DiLoCo while communicating 8X less and having identical memory complexity.

<title>EmotionRankCLAP: Bridging Natural Language Speaking Styles and Ordinal Speech Emotion via Rank-N-Contrast</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current emotion-based contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) methods typically learn by na\"ively aligning audio samples with corresponding text prompts. Consequently, this approach fails to capture the ordinal nature of emotions, hindering inter-emotion understanding and often resulting in a wide modality gap between the audio and text embeddings due to insufficient alignment. To handle these drawbacks, we introduce EmotionRankCLAP, a supervised contrastive learning approach that uses dimensional attributes of emotional speech and natural language prompts to jointly capture fine-grained emotion variations and improve cross-modal alignment. Our approach utilizes a Rank-N-Contrast objective to learn ordered relationships by contrasting samples based on their rankings in the valence-arousal space. EmotionRankCLAP outperforms existing emotion-CLAP methods in modeling emotion ordinality across modalities, measured via a cross-modal retrieval task.

<title>Distortion of AI Alignment: Does Preference Optimization Optimize for Preferences?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.23749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After pre-training, large language models are aligned with human preferences based on pairwise comparisons. State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users' comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy.
  The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature $\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy. RLHF and DPO, by contrast, suffer $\geq (1 - o(1)) \cdot \beta$ distortion already without a KL constraint, and $e^{\Omega(\beta)}$ or even unbounded distortion in the full setting, depending on how comparison pairs are sampled.

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space. REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to 3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Abstract: Model immunization aims to pre-train models that are difficult to fine-tune on harmful tasks while retaining their utility on other non-harmful tasks. Though prior work has shown empirical evidence for immunizing text-to-image models, the key understanding of when immunization is possible and a precise definition of an immunized model remain unclear. In this work, we propose a framework, based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model immunization for linear models. Building on this framework, we design an algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of differential information.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation, controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging strategies under realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction industry by providing a comprehensive digital representation of building structures throughout their lifecycle. However, existing research lacks effective methods for capturing the complex spatial and topological relationships between components in BIM models, which are essential for understanding design patterns and enhancing decision-making. This study proposes a unified network-based representation method that integrates the "semantic-spatial-topological" multi-dimensional design features of BIM models. By extending the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) standard, we introduce local spatial relationships and topological connections between components to enrich the network structure. This representation method enables a more detailed understanding of component interactions, dependencies, and implicit design patterns, effectively capturing the semantic, topological, and spatial relationships in BIM, and holds significant potential for the representation and learning of design patterns.

Abstract: Predicting protein complex structures is essential for protein function analysis, protein design, and drug discovery. While AI methods like AlphaFold can predict accurate structural models for many protein complexes, reliably estimating the quality of these predicted models (estimation of model accuracy, or EMA) for model ranking and selection remains a major challenge. A key barrier to developing effective machine learning-based EMA methods is the lack of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for training and evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce PSBench, a benchmark suite comprising four large-scale, labeled datasets generated during the 15th and 16th community-wide Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15 and CASP16). PSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of protein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and modeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary quality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also provides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate rigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and evaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE was blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing EMA methods. These results highlight PSBench as a valuable resource for advancing EMA research in protein complex modeling. PSBench is publicly available at: https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PSBench.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-frequency trading (HFT), leveraging limit order books (LOB) to model stock price movements is crucial for achieving profitable outcomes. However, this task is challenging due to the high-dimensional and volatile nature of the original data. Even recent deep learning models often struggle to capture price movement patterns effectively, particularly without well-designed features. We observed that raw LOB data exhibits inherent symmetry between the ask and bid sides, and the bid-ask differences demonstrate greater stability and lower complexity compared to the original data. Building on this insight, we propose a novel approach in which leverages the Siamese architecture to enhance the performance of existing deep learning models. The core idea involves processing the ask and bid sides separately using the same module with shared parameters. We applied our Siamese-based methods to several widely used strong baselines and validated their effectiveness using data from 14 military industry stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Furthermore, we integrated multi-head attention (MHA) mechanisms with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to investigate its role in modeling stock price movements. Our experiments used raw data and widely used Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) features as input with some strong baseline models. The results show that our method improves the performance of strong baselines in over 75$% of cases, excluding the Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) baseline, which performed poorly and is not considered practical. Furthermore, we found that Multi-Head Attention can enhance model performance, particularly over shorter forecasting horizons.

Abstract: Community partitioning is crucial in network analysis, with modularity optimization being the prevailing technique. However, traditional modularity-based methods often overlook fairness, a critical aspect in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce protected group networks and propose a novel fairness-modularity metric. This metric extends traditional modularity by explicitly incorporating fairness, and we prove that minimizing it yields naturally fair partitions for protected groups while maintaining theoretical soundness. We develop a general optimization framework for fairness partitioning and design the efficient Fair Fast Newman (FairFN) algorithm, enhancing the Fast Newman (FN) method to optimize both modularity and fairness. Experiments show FairFN achieves significantly improved fairness and high-quality partitions compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on unbalanced datasets.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior, remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features (e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.

Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool - Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features, and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework, StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in complex traits.

Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.

<title>Decomposing Elements of Problem Solving: What "Math" Does RL Teach?</title>

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps), Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving. This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning, expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of its unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map. Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map. Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score.

Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL) setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making, offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent problems.

Abstract: We investigate the end-to-end altitude estimation performance of a convolutional autoencoder-based interference mitigation approach for frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar altimeters. Specifically, we show that a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) autoencoder effectively exploits temporal correlations in the received signal, providing superior interference suppression compared to a Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filter. Unlike existing approaches, the present method operates directly on the received FMCW signal. Additionally, we identify key challenges in applying deep learning to wideband FMCW interference mitigation and outline directions for future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to arbitrary interference conditions.

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD) with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a (univariate) convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

arXiv:2505.22811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights, which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization methods.

<title>IMTS is Worth Time $\times$ Channel Patches: Visual Masked Autoencoders for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22815</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts. In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/WHU-HZY/VIMTS.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length, outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and introducing minimal additional parameters.

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers, attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

Abstract: In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP), in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for quantifying access control in LLMs.

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints. Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers. Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally, off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins, while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models. Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM) to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution for merging LoRA models.

Abstract: A key task in certain democratic processes is to produce a concise slate of statements that proportionally represents the full spectrum of user opinions. This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings, the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets related to city improvement measures and drug reviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating representative slates from unstructured user opinions.

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios.

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future VLM development. Project page available at https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/NegVQA/.

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD) approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

<title>ToMAP: Training Opponent-Aware LLM Persuaders with Theory of Mind</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate, time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation, MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention. MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human designers.

<title>Theoretical Foundations of the Deep Copula Classifier: A Generative Approach to Modeling Dependent Features</title>

Abstract: Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC), a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies. We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks, DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for dependency-aware classification.

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is critical for treatment safety. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR), we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.

<title>Improved Last-Iterate Convergence of Shuffling Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization</title>

Abstract: We study the convergence of the shuffling gradient method, a popular algorithm employed to minimize the finite-sum function with regularization, in which functions are passed to apply (Proximal) Gradient Descent (GD) one by one whose order is determined by a permutation on the indices of functions. In contrast to its easy implementation and effective performance in practice, the theoretical understanding remains limited. A recent advance by (Liu & Zhou, 2024b) establishes the first last-iterate convergence results under various settings, especially proving the optimal rates for smooth (strongly) convex optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et al., 2022).

Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.

Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs), current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency, or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an increase in accuracy on MedQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs. F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX (Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 45.2%).

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.

<title>Learning to Incentivize in Repeated Principal-Agent Problems with Adversarial Agent Arrivals</title>

Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight. Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously in each round.

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow signals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS) methods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory, we present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming signals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed stochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions, steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the impact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design optimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired estimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g., the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world traffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed settings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order topological features.

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty quantification with finite-sample validity guarantees, making it an attractive tool for constructing reliable prediction sets. However, existing approaches commonly rely on residual-based conformity scores, which impose geometric constraints and struggle when the underlying distribution is multimodal. In particular, they tend to produce overly conservative prediction areas centred around the mean, often failing to capture the true shape of complex predictive distributions. In this work, we introduce JAPAN (Joint Adaptive Prediction Areas with Normalising-Flows), a conformal prediction framework that uses density-based conformity scores. By leveraging flow-based models, JAPAN estimates the (predictive) density and constructs prediction areas by thresholding on the estimated density scores, enabling compact, potentially disjoint, and context-adaptive regions that retain finite-sample coverage guarantees. We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically validate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating good calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines. We also provide several \emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed framework.

Abstract: Overlapping Speech Detection (OSD) aims to identify regions where multiple speakers overlap in a conversation, a critical challenge in multi-party speech processing. This work proposes a speaker-aware progressive OSD model that leverages a progressive training strategy to enhance the correlation between subtasks such as voice activity detection (VAD) and overlap detection. To improve acoustic representation, we explore the effectiveness of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including WavLM and wav2vec 2.0, while incorporating a speaker attention module to enrich features with frame-level speaker information. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an F1 score of 82.76\% on the AMI test set, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in OSD.

Abstract: Accurately modeling time-continuous stochastic processes from irregular observations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.

Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a ``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are very sparse and disconnected.

Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms.

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder, enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual learning settings. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MaolinLuo/LADA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation. However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability. Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon, we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories.

<title>Adversarial Semantic and Label Perturbation Attack for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition</title>

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition. Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains (i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

<title>Enhancing Marker Scoring Accuracy through Ordinal Confidence Modelling in Educational Assessments</title>

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level. While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where we release all AM predicted scores.

<title>Fine-Tuning Next-Scale Visual Autoregressive Models with Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

<title>A Descriptor Is All You Need: Accurate Machine Learning of Nonadiabatic Coupling Vectors</title>

Abstract: Nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) play a crucial role in modeling photochemical and photophysical processes with methods such as the widely used fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH). There is therefore a strong incentive to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of $S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source MLatom.

<title>Dynamic Estimation Loss Control in Variational Quantum Sensing via Online Conformal Inference</title>

Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations. Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring accurate lip synchronization.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value (KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand, leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately 2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval, reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces $k$-Dynamic Time Warping ($k$-DTW), a novel dissimilarity measure for polygonal curves. $k$-DTW has stronger metric properties than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and is more robust to outliers than the Fr\'{e}chet distance, which are the two gold standards of dissimilarity measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest neighbor classification.

<title>Emergent Risk Awareness in Rational Agents under Resource Constraints</title>

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

<title>The Strong, Weak and Benign Goodhart's law. An independence-free and paradigm-agnostic formalisation</title>

Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and the metric. %

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: Audio DNNs have demonstrated impressive performance on various machine listening tasks; however, most of their representations are computationally costly and uninterpretable, leaving room for optimization. Here, we propose a novel approach centered on spectrotemporal modulation (STM) features, a signal processing method that mimics the neurophysiological representation in the human auditory cortex. The classification performance of our STM-based model, without any pretraining, is comparable to that of pretrained audio DNNs across diverse naturalistic speech, music, and environmental sounds, which are essential categories for both human cognition and machine perception. These results show that STM is an efficient and interpretable feature representation for audio classification, advancing the development of machine listening and unlocking exciting new possibilities for basic understanding of speech and auditory sciences, as well as developing audio BCI and cognitive computing.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further improvements.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Earth science multimodal learning exhibit critical limitations in systematic coverage of geosystem components and cross-sphere interactions, often constrained to isolated subsystems (only in Human-activities sphere or atmosphere) with limited evaluation dimensions (less than 16 tasks). To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres (atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The dataset, source code, and trained models were released.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, and Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences. Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants. While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for preferences based on the log-probability reward.

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens, causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain (Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention. Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection. Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing hallucinations. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Liar406/Look_Again.

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising 3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets. Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05, $p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p = 0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance, especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external validity in real-world medical applications.

<title>Multilook Coherent Imaging: Theoretical Guarantees and Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging, providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations, significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, particularly in voice cloning, have intensified the demand for adaptable and efficient deepfake detection methods. As TTS systems continue to evolve, detection models must be able to efficiently adapt to previously unseen generation models with minimal data. This paper introduces ADD-GP, a few-shot adaptive framework based on a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier for Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD). We show how the combination of a powerful deep embedding model with the Gaussian processes flexibility can achieve strong performance and adaptability. Additionally, we show this approach can also be used for personalized detection, with greater robustness to new TTS models and one-shot adaptability. To support our evaluation, a benchmark dataset is constructed for this task using new state-of-the-art voice cloning models.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of estimating an unknown discrete distribution $p$ over $d$ symbols, given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the distribution. We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the true distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax optimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on an algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and simple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on real distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality viewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum achievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under natural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve instance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential privacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the Good-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that more precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL divergence, compared to ones considered in prior works.

<title>Are Reasoning Models More Prone to Hallucination?</title>

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks, whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1) We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling, typically relying on optimizing neural networks to estimate the score function via forward SDE simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative method that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann distributions and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a new Bayesian perspective on the concept of data reconstruction, and leverage this viewpoint to propose a new security definition that, in certain settings, provably prevents reconstruction attacks. We use our paradigm to shed new light on one of the most notorious attacks in the privacy and memorization literature - fingerprinting code attacks (FPC). We argue that these attacks are really a form of membership inference attacks, rather than reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we show that if the goal is solely to prevent reconstruction (but not membership inference), then in some cases the impossibility results derived from FPC no longer apply.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA: Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to 97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1 8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on a single consumer GPU.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

<title>Mobi-$\pi$: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy</title>

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this, SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The majority of parameters in neural networks are naturally represented as matrices. However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters as flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their inherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been proposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters. Extensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform traditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind its superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with Gradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon can outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from the low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices -- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our experimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/TrustVLM.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering, a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

Abstract: While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has fueled multiple high-profile successes in machine learning, it is held back from more widespread adoption by its often poor data efficiency and the limited generality of the policies it produces. A promising approach for alleviating these limitations is to cast the development of better RL algorithms as a machine learning problem itself in a process called meta-RL. Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task. Using these clusters, we then survey meta-RL algorithms and applications. We conclude by presenting the open problems on the path to making meta-RL part of the standard toolbox for a deep RL practitioner.

This coordination is governed by a graph-based regularizer that encourages connected models to produce similar predictions on a shared, public unlabeled dataset. The resulting method is a flexible instance of regularized empirical risk minimization and supports a wide variety of local models - both parametric and non-parametric - provided they can be trained via regularized loss minimization. Such training is readily supported by standard ML libraries including scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch.

<title>When Collaborative Filtering is not Collaborative: Unfairness of PCA for Recommendations</title>

Abstract: We study the fairness of dimensionality reduction methods for recommendations. We focus on the fundamental method of principal component analysis (PCA), which identifies latent components and produces a low-rank approximation via the leading components while discarding the trailing components. Prior works have defined notions of "fair PCA"; however, these definitions do not answer the following question: why is PCA unfair? We identify two underlying popularity mechanisms that induce item unfairness in PCA. The first negatively impacts less popular items because less popular items rely on trailing latent components to recover their values. The second negatively impacts highly popular items, since the leading PCA components specialize in individual popular items instead of capturing similarities between items. To address these issues, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm, Item-Weighted PCA, that flexibly up-weights less popular items when optimizing for leading principal components. We theoretically show that PCA, in all cases, and Normalized PCA, in cases of block-diagonal matrices, are instances of Item-Weighted PCA. We empirically show that there exist datasets for which Item-Weighted PCA yields the optimal solution while the baselines do not. In contrast to past dimensionality reduction re-weighting techniques, Item-Weighted PCA solves a convex optimization problem and enforces a hard rank constraint. Our evaluations on real-world datasets show that Item-Weighted PCA not only mitigates both unfairness mechanisms, but also produces recommendations that outperform those of PCA baselines.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm leveraging LLMs for specific downstream tasks by utilizing labeled examples as demonstrations (demos) in the preconditioned prompts. Despite its promising performance, crafted adversarial attacks pose a notable threat to the robustness of LLMs. Existing attacks are either easy to detect, require a trigger in user input, or lack specificity towards ICL. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel transferable prompt injection attack against ICL, aiming to hijack LLMs to generate the target output or elicit harmful responses. In our threat model, the hacker acts as a model publisher who leverages a gradient-based prompt search method to learn and append imperceptible adversarial suffixes to the in-context demos via prompt injection. We also propose effective defense strategies using a few shots of clean demos, enhancing the robustness of LLMs during ICL. Extensive experimental results across various classification and jailbreak tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack and defense strategies. This work highlights the significant security vulnerabilities of LLMs during ICL and underscores the need for further in-depth studies.

Abstract: A simple and effective method for the inference-time alignment and scaling test-time compute of generative models is best-of-$n$ sampling, where $n$ samples are drawn from a reference policy, ranked based on a reward function, and the highest ranking one is selected. A commonly used analytical expression in the literature claims that the KL divergence between the best-of-$n$ policy and the reference policy is equal to $\log (n) - (n-1)/n.$ We disprove the validity of this claim, and show that it is an upper bound on the actual KL divergence. We also explore the tightness of this upper bound in different regimes, and propose a new estimator for the KL divergence and empirically show that it provides a tight approximation. We also show that the win rate of the best-of-$n$ policy against the reference policy is upper bounded by $n/(n+1)$ and derive bounds on the tightness of this characterization. We conclude with analyzing the tradeoffs between win rate and KL divergence of the best-of-$n$ alignment policy, which demonstrate that very good tradeoffs are achievable with $n < 1000$.

Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved. This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit high performance in image recognition; however, the reasons for their strong generalization abilities remain unclear. A plausible hypothesis is that DNNs achieve robust and accurate predictions by identifying multiple pieces of evidence from images. Thus, to test this hypothesis, this study proposed minimal sufficient views (MSVs). MSVs is defined as a set of minimal regions within an input image that are sufficient to preserve the prediction of DNNs, thus representing the evidence discovered by the DNN. We empirically demonstrated a strong correlation between the number of MSVs (i.e., the number of pieces of evidence) and the generalization performance of the DNN models. Remarkably, this correlation was found to hold within a single DNN as well as between different DNNs, including convolutional and transformer models. This suggested that a DNN model that makes its prediction based on more evidence has a higher generalization performance. We proposed a metric based on MSVs for DNN model selection that did not require label information. Consequently, we empirically showed that the proposed metric was less dependent on the degree of overfitting, rendering it a more reliable indicator of model performance than existing metrics, such as average confidence.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked significant achievements in language processing and reasoning capabilities. Despite their advancements, LLMs face vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where the adversary inserts backdoor triggers into training data to manipulate outputs. This work further identifies additional security risks in LLMs by designing a new data poisoning attack tailored to exploit the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process. We propose a novel gradient-guided backdoor trigger learning (GBTL) algorithm to identify adversarial triggers efficiently, ensuring an evasion of detection by conventional defenses while maintaining content integrity. Through experimental validation across various language model tasks, including sentiment analysis, domain generation, and question answering, our poisoning strategy demonstrates a high success rate in compromising various LLMs' outputs. We further propose two defense strategies against data poisoning attacks, including in-context learning (ICL) and continuous learning (CL), which effectively rectify the behavior of LLMs and significantly reduce the decline in performance. Our work highlights the significant security risks present during SFT of LLMs and the necessity of safeguarding LLMs against data poisoning attacks.

We present OmniArch, the first prototype aiming at solving multi-scale and multi-physics scientific computing problems with physical alignment. We addressed all three challenges with one unified architecture. Its pre-training stage contains a Fourier Encoder-decoder fading out the disharmony across separated dimensions and a Transformer backbone integrating quantities through temporal dynamics, and the novel PDE-Aligner performs physics-informed fine-tuning under flexible conditions. As far as we know, we first conduct 1D-2D-3D united pre-training on the PDEBench, and it sets not only new performance benchmarks for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs but also demonstrates exceptional adaptability to new physics via in-context and zero-shot learning approaches, which supports realistic engineering applications and foresight physics discovery.

Abstract: Machine-learning models demand periodic updates to improve their average accuracy, exploiting novel architectures and additional data. However, a newly updated model may commit mistakes the previous model did not make. Such misclassifications are referred to as negative flips, experienced by users as a regression of performance. In this work, we show that this problem also affects robustness to adversarial examples, hindering the development of secure model update practices. In particular, when updating a model to improve its adversarial robustness, previously ineffective adversarial attacks on some inputs may become successful, causing a regression in the perceived security of the system. We propose a novel technique, named robustness-congruent adversarial training, to address this issue. It amounts to fine-tuning a model with adversarial training, while constraining it to retain higher robustness on the samples for which no adversarial example was found before the update. We show that our algorithm and, more generally, learning with non-regression constraints, provides a theoretically-grounded framework to train consistent estimators. Our experiments on robust models for computer vision confirm that both accuracy and robustness, even if improved after model update, can be affected by negative flips, and our robustness-congruent adversarial training can mitigate the problem, outperforming competing baseline methods.

Abstract: Continual learning is crucial for applying machine learning in challenging, dynamic, and often resource-constrained environments. However, catastrophic forgetting - overwriting previously learned knowledge when new information is acquired - remains a major challenge. In this work, we examine the intermediate representations in neural network layers during continual learning and find that such representations are less prone to forgetting, highlighting their potential to accelerate computation. Motivated by these findings, we propose to use auxiliary classifiers(ACs) to enhance performance and demonstrate that integrating ACs into various continual learning methods consistently improves accuracy across diverse evaluation settings, yielding an average 10% relative gain. We also leverage the ACs to reduce the average cost of the inference by 10-60% without compromising accuracy, enabling the model to return the predictions before computing all the layers. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning.

Abstract: Expert parallelism has emerged as a key strategy for distributing the computational workload of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) models across multiple devices, enabling the processing of increasingly large-scale models. However, the All-to-All communication inherent to expert parallelism poses a significant bottleneck, limiting the efficiency of MoE models. Although existing optimization methods partially mitigate this issue, they remain constrained by the sequential dependency between communication and computation operations. To address this challenge, we propose ScMoE, a novel shortcut-connected MoE architecture integrated with an overlapping parallelization strategy. ScMoE decouples communication from its conventional sequential ordering, enabling up to 100% overlap with computation. Compared to the prevalent top-2 MoE baseline, ScMoE achieves speedups of 1.49 times in training and 1.82 times in inference. Moreover, our experiments and analyses indicate that ScMoE not only achieves comparable but in some instances surpasses the model quality of existing approaches.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is impeded by two key challenges: objective metrics often fail to reflect human perception of natural language, and exhaustive human labeling is prohibitively expensive. Here, we propose a sample-efficient human evaluation method for LLMs based on the principle of MAximum Discrepancy (MAD) Competition. Our method automatically and adaptively selects a compact set of input instructions that maximize semantic discrepancy between pairs of LLM responses. Human evaluators then perform three-alternative forced choices on these paired responses, which are aggregated into a global ranking using Elo rating. We apply our approach to compare eight widely used LLMs across four tasks: scientific knowledge understanding, mathematical reasoning, creative and functional writing, and code generation and explanation. Experimental results show that our sample-efficient evaluation method recovers "gold-standard" model rankings with a handful of MAD-selected instructions, reveals respective strengths and weaknesses of each LLM, and offers nuanced insights to guide future LLM development. Code is available at https://github.com/weiji-Feng/MAD-Eval .

Abstract: Machine learning models can be trained with formal privacy guarantees via differentially private optimizers such as DP-SGD. In this work, we focus on a threat model where the adversary has access only to the final model, with no visibility into intermediate updates. In the literature, this hidden state threat model exhibits a significant gap between the lower bound from empirical privacy auditing and the theoretical upper bound provided by privacy accounting. To challenge this gap, we propose to audit this threat model with adversaries that craft a gradient sequence designed to maximize the privacy loss of the final model without relying on intermediate updates. Our experiments show that this approach consistently outperforms previous attempts at auditing the hidden state model. Furthermore, our results advance the understanding of achievable privacy guarantees within this threat model. Specifically, when the crafted gradient is inserted at every optimization step, we show that concealing the intermediate model updates in DP-SGD does not enhance the privacy guarantees. The situation is more complex when the crafted gradient is not inserted at every step: our auditing lower bound matches the privacy upper bound only for an adversarially-chosen loss landscape and a sufficiently large batch size. This suggests that existing privacy upper bounds can be improved in certain regimes.

Abstract: The growing complexity of AI systems has intensified the need for transparency through Explainable AI (XAI). Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer actionable "what-if" scenarios on three levels: Local CFs providing instance-specific insights, Global CFs addressing broader trends, and Group-wise CFs (GWCFs) striking a balance and revealing patterns within cohesive groups. Despite the availability of methods for each granularity level, the field lacks a unified method that integrates these complementary approaches. We address this limitation by proposing a gradient-based optimization method for differentiable models that generates Local, Global, and Group-wise Counterfactual Explanations in a unified manner. We especially enhance GWCF generation by combining instance grouping and counterfactual generation into a single efficient process, replacing traditional two-step methods. Moreover, to ensure trustworthiness, we innovatively introduce the integration of plausibility criteria into the GWCF domain, making explanations both valid and realistic. Our results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in balancing validity, proximity, and plausibility while optimizing group granularity, with practical utility validated through practical use cases.

Abstract: Data plays a central role in advancements in modern artificial intelligence, with high-quality data emerging as a key driver of model performance. This has prompted the development of principled and effective data curation methods in recent years. However, existing methods largely rely on heuristics, and whether they are truly effective remains unclear. For instance, standard evaluation methods that assess a trained model's performance on specific benchmarks may incentivize assigning high scores to data that merely resembles the test set. This issue exemplifies Goodhart's law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic framework for evaluating data curation methods. We define dataset quality in terms of its informativeness about the true model parameters, formalized using the Blackwell ordering of informativeness. Under this ordering, Blackwell's theorem ensures that more informative data yields optimal models with lower expected loss on the true underlying distribution. To measure informativeness, we show that the Blackwell order can be determined by the Shannon mutual information between the curated data and the test data. To estimate this mutual information, we introduce a novel method that trains Bayesian models on embedded datasets and computes mutual information from the posteriors of model parameters. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our mutual information-based evaluation assigns appropriately lower scores to data curation strategies that reduce dataset informativeness, while traditional test score-based evaluation methods may favor data curation strategies that overfit to the test set but compromise the training data's informativeness.

Abstract: Recent innovations in diffusion probabilistic models have paved the way for significant progress in image, text and audio generation, leading to their applications in generative time series forecasting. However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) agents has raised new concerns regarding their safety and security. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

Abstract: The diagnostic accuracy and subjectivity of existing Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) ordinal grading systems has been a subject of on-going debate and concern. Existing automated solutions are trained to emulate these imperfect systems, whilst also being reliant on large annotated databases for fully-supervised training. This work proposes a three stage approach for automated continuous grading of knee OA that is built upon the principles of Anomaly Detection (AD); learning a robust representation of healthy knee X-rays and grading disease severity based on its distance to the centre of normality. In the first stage, SS-FewSOME is proposed, a self-supervised AD technique that learns the 'normal' representation, requiring only examples of healthy subjects and <3% of the labels that existing methods require. In the second stage, this model is used to pseudo label a subset of unlabelled data as 'normal' or 'anomalous', followed by denoising of pseudo labels with CLIP. The final stage involves retraining on labelled and pseudo labelled data using the proposed Dual Centre Representation Learning (DCRL) which learns the centres of two representation spaces; normal and anomalous. Disease severity is then graded based on the distance to the learned centres. The proposed methodology outperforms existing techniques by margins of up to 24% in terms of OA detection and the disease severity scores correlate with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system at the same level as human expert performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies from a fixed dataset, but often requires large amounts of data. The challenge arises when labeled datasets are expensive, especially when rewards have to be provided by human labelers for large datasets. In contrast, unlabelled data tends to be less expensive. This situation highlights the importance of finding effective ways to use unlabelled data in offline RL, especially when labelled data is limited or expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present the algorithm to utilize the unlabeled data in the offline RL method with kernel function approximation and give the theoretical guarantee. We present various eigenvalue decay conditions of $\mathcal{H}_k$ which determine the complexity of the algorithm. In summary, our work provides a promising approach for exploiting the advantages offered by unlabeled data in offline RL, whilst maintaining theoretical assurances.

Abstract: This paper considers a novel variant of the online fair division problem involving multiple agents in which a learner sequentially observes an indivisible item that has to be irrevocably allocated to one of the agents while satisfying a fairness and efficiency constraint. Existing algorithms assume a small number of items with a sufficiently large number of copies, which ensures a good utility estimation for all item-agent pairs from noisy bandit feedback. However, this assumption may not hold in many real-life applications, for example, an online platform that has a large number of users (items) who use the platform's service providers (agents) only a few times (a few copies of items), which makes it difficult to accurately estimate utilities for all item-agent pairs. To address this, we assume utility is an unknown function of item-agent features. We then propose algorithms that model online fair division as a contextual bandit problem, with sub-linear regret guarantees.

<title>Instruct-SkillMix: A Powerful Pipeline for LLM Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data for instruction-following. The pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following by directly prompting the model. This is inspired by ``LLM metacognition'' of Didolkar et al. (2024); (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty. The estimated cost of creating the dataset is under $600.
  Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just 4K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0, a level similar to frontier models like Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct. Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. In our dataset, adding 20% low quality answers (``shirkers'') causes a noticeable degradation in performance. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline seems flexible and adaptable to other settings.

Abstract: Many important machine learning applications involve networks of devices-such as wearables or smartphones-that generate local data and train personalized models. A key challenge is determining which peers are most beneficial for collaboration. We propose a simple and privacy-preserving method to select relevant collaborators by evaluating how much a model improves after a single gradient step using another devices data-without sharing raw data. This method naturally extends to non-parametric models by replacing the gradient step with a non-parametric generalization. Our approach enables model-agnostic, data-driven peer selection for personalized federated learning (PersFL).

Abstract: While direct policy optimization methods exist, pioneering LLMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to generate better responses under the supervision of a reward model learned from preference data. One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex reasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of determination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as the metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the rewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math reasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%), and LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by us. In math reasoning, PF-PPO yields performance increase using different reward models and benchmarks (Ape210K and CMATH). Code is available on https://github.com/DtYXs/verl/tree/pf-ppo.

Abstract: On-device LLMs have gained increasing attention for their ability to enhance privacy and provide a personalized user experience. To facilitate private learning with scarce data, Federated Learning has become a standard approach. However, it faces challenges such as computational resource heterogeneity and data heterogeneity among end users. We propose CoMiGS ($\textbf{Co}$llaborative learning with a $\textbf{Mi}$xture of $\textbf{G}$eneralists and $\textbf{S}$pecialists), the first approach to address both challenges. A key innovation of our method is the bi-level optimization formulation of the Mixture-of-Experts learning objective, where the router is optimized using a separate validation set to ensure alignment with the target distribution. We solve our objective with alternating minimization, for which we provide a theoretical analysis. Our method shares generalist experts across users while localizing a varying number of specialist experts, thereby adapting to users' computational resources and preserving privacy. Through extensive experiments, we show CoMiGS effectively balances general and personalized knowledge for each token generation. We demonstrate that CoMiGS remains robust against overfitting-due to the generalists' regularizing effect-while adapting to local data through specialist expertise. We open source our codebase for collaborative LLMs.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned tasks. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world data.

Abstract: Confidence calibration is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. However, such issue in vision-language models like CLIP, particularly after fine-tuning, has not been fully addressed. In this work, we demonstrate that existing prompt tuning methods usually lead to a trade-off of calibration between base and new classes: the cross-entropy loss in CoOp causes overconfidence in new classes by increasing textual label divergence, whereas the regularization of KgCoOp maintains the confidence level but results in underconfidence in base classes due to the improved accuracy. Inspired by the observations, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Regularization (DOR) to ensure the confidence calibration on both base and new classes after fine-tuning. In particular, we propose to minimize the feature deviation of novel textual labels (instead of base classes) sampled from a large vocabulary. In effect, DOR prevents the increase in textual divergence for new labels while easing restrictions on base classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DOR can enhance the calibration performance of current fine-tuning methods on base and new classes.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic learning enables the integration of symbolic reasoning with deep learning but faces significant challenges in scaling to complex symbolic programs, large datasets, or both. We introduce DOLPHIN, a framework that tackles these challenges by supporting neurosymbolic programs in Python, executing complex symbolic reasoning on the CPU while vectorizing probabilistic computations and gradient propagation on the GPU. Across 13 benchmarks spanning tasks over text, image, and video data, with symbolic reasoning features like recursion and black-box functions, DOLPHIN converges to state-of-the-art accuracies on the more complex benchmarks while existing frameworks such as Scallop, ISED, and IndeCateR+ fail to converge within the time limit. On simpler benchmarks, DOLPHIN matches their performance, while achieving these results 1.71x to 62x faster than the baselines. Overall, DOLPHIN advances the scalability of neurosymbolic frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency and convergence on difficult benchmarks where existing frameworks struggle. The code is published at https://github.com/Dolphin-NeSy/Dolphin.

Abstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions-a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks-flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration-while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers aiming to tailor RNN solutions-whether to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have been fueled by the development of foundation models such as BERT, GPT, T5, and Vision Transformers. These models are first pretrained on vast and diverse datasets and then adapted to specific downstream tasks, often with significantly less data. However, the mechanisms behind the success of this ubiquitous pretrain-then-adapt paradigm remain underexplored, particularly the characteristics of pretraining checkpoints that enhance downstream adaptation. We introduce a Bayesian model selection criterion, called the downstream free energy, which quantifies a checkpoint's adaptability by measuring the concentration of nearby favorable parameters for the downstream task. We demonstrate that this Bayesian model selection criterion can be effectively implemented without access to the downstream data or prior knowledge of the downstream task. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that the criterion reliably correlates with improved finetuning performance, offering a principled approach to predicting model adaptability.

Abstract: Conventional model compression techniques for LLMs address high memory consumption and slow inference challenges but typically require computationally expensive retraining to preserve accuracy. In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 4.3x and 3.8x on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, they achieve up to 0.23x end-to-end memory reduction in comparison to their dense counterparts. We also propose an optional PEFT recipe that further improves accuracy by up to 1.66% (LLaMA-2-13B) compared to SLIM without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in CV and NLP have been largely driven by scaling up the number of network parameters, despite traditional theories suggesting that larger networks are prone to overfitting. These large networks avoid overfitting by integrating components that induce a simplicity bias, guiding models toward simple and generalizable solutions. However, in deep RL, designing and scaling up networks have been less explored. Motivated by this opportunity, we present SimBa, an architecture designed to scale up parameters in deep RL by injecting a simplicity bias. SimBa consists of three components: (i) an observation normalization layer that standardizes inputs with running statistics, (ii) a residual feedforward block to provide a linear pathway from the input to output, and (iii) a layer normalization to control feature magnitudes. By scaling up parameters with SimBa, the sample efficiency of various deep RL algorithms-including off-policy, on-policy, and unsupervised methods-is consistently improved. Moreover, solely by integrating SimBa architecture into SAC, it matches or surpasses state-of-the-art deep RL methods with high computational efficiency across DMC, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench. These results demonstrate SimBa's broad applicability and effectiveness across diverse RL algorithms and environments.

Abstract: Although transformers have demonstrated impressive capabilities for in-context learning (ICL) in practice, theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism that allows transformers to perform ICL is still in its infancy. This work aims to theoretically study the training dynamics of transformers for in-context classification tasks. We demonstrate that, for in-context classification of Gaussian mixtures under certain assumptions, a single-layer transformer trained via gradient descent converges to a globally optimal model at a linear rate. We further quantify the impact of the training and testing prompt lengths on the ICL inference error of the trained transformer. We show that when the lengths of training and testing prompts are sufficiently large, the prediction of the trained transformer approaches the ground truth distribution of the labels. Experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.

Abstract: Inverse problems aim to reconstruct unseen data from corrupted or perturbed measurements. While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Graph representation learning has garnered significant attention due to its broad applications in various domains, such as recommendation systems and social network analysis. Despite advancements in graph learning methods, challenges still remain in explainability when graphs are associated with semantic features. In this paper, we present GraphNarrator, the first method designed to generate natural language explanations for Graph Neural Networks. GraphNarrator employs a generative language model that maps input-output pairs to explanations reflecting the model's decision-making process. To address the lack of ground truth explanations to train the model, we propose first generating pseudo-labels that capture the model's decisions from saliency-based explanations, then using Expert Iteration to iteratively train the pseudo-label generator based on training objectives on explanation quality. The high-quality pseudo-labels are finally utilized to train an end-to-end explanation generator model. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphNarrator in producing faithful, concise, and human-preferred natural language explanations.

Abstract: Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on high-performance computing for complex modeling and simulation. A key challenge in improving parallel program performance is efficiently mapping tasks to processors and data to memory, a process dictated by intricate, low-level system code known as mappers. Developing high-performance mappers demands days of manual tuning, posing a significant barrier for domain scientists without systems expertise. We introduce a framework that automates mapper development with generative optimization, leveraging richer feedback beyond scalar performance metrics. Our approach features the Agent-System Interface, which includes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to abstract away the low-level complexity of system code and define a structured search space, as well as AutoGuide, a mechanism that interprets raw execution output into actionable feedback. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods such as OpenTuner, which rely solely on scalar feedback, our method finds superior mappers in far fewer iterations. With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving 3.8X faster performance. Our approach finds mappers that surpass expert-written mappers by up to 1.34X speedup across nine benchmarks while reducing tuning time from days to minutes.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) algorithms alter models' weights to perform targeted updates to incorrect, outdated, or otherwise unwanted factual associations. However, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' broader factual recall accuracy and diminish their reasoning abilities. Although these studies give insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., performance evaluations on benchmarks, little is understood about why such destructive failures occur. Motivated by this, we define a novel synthetic task in which a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a "structured" knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models on this task, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it degrades models' factual recall and reasoning performance. We further corroborate our findings in naturalistic settings with pre-trained Llama and Mamba models as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model abilities.

Abstract: We investigate the high-dimensional sparse linear bandits problem in a data-poor regime where the time horizon is much smaller than the ambient dimension and number of arms. We study the setting under the additional blocking constraint where each unique arm can be pulled only once. The blocking constraint is motivated by practical applications in personalized content recommendation and identification of data points to improve annotation efficiency for complex learning tasks. With mild assumptions on the arms, our proposed online algorithm (BSLB) achieves a regret guarantee of $\widetilde{\mathsf{O}}((1+\beta_k)^2k^{\frac{2}{3}} \mathsf{T}^{\frac{2}{3}})$ where the parameter vector has an (unknown) relative tail $\beta_k$ -- the ratio of $\ell_1$ norm of the top-$k$ and remaining entries of the parameter vector. To this end, we show novel offline statistical guarantees of the lasso estimator for the linear model that is robust to the sparsity modeling assumption. Finally, we propose a meta-algorithm (C-BSLB) based on corralling that does not need knowledge of optimal sparsity parameter $k$ at minimal cost to regret. Our experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the validity of our algorithms and theoretical framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance in solving complex language tasks. However, its large number of parameters presents significant challenges for the deployment. So, compressing LLMs to low bits can enable to deploy on resource-constrained devices. To address this problem, we propose gradient-aware weight quantization (GWQ), the first quantization approach for low-bit weight quantization that leverages gradients to localize outliers, requiring only a minimal amount of calibration data for outlier detection. GWQ retains the top 1\% outliers preferentially at FP16 precision, while the remaining non-outlier weights are stored in a low-bit. We widely evaluate GWQ on different task include language modeling, grounding detection, massive multitask language understanding and vision-language question and answering. Results show that models quantified by GWQ performs better than other quantization method. During quantization process, GWQ only need one calibration set to realize effective quant. Also, GWQ achieves 1.2x inference speedup in comparison to the original model and effectively reduces the inference memory.

Abstract: While powerful for generation, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) face slow sampling challenges, for which various distillation-based methods have been proposed. However, they typically require significant additional training costs and model parameter storage, limiting their practicality. In this work, we propose PCA-based Adaptive Search (PAS), which optimizes existing solvers for DPMs with minimal additional costs. Specifically, we first employ PCA to obtain a few basis vectors to span the high-dimensional sampling space, which enables us to learn just a set of coordinates to correct the sampling direction; furthermore, based on the observation that the cumulative truncation error exhibits an ``S"-shape, we design an adaptive search strategy that further enhances the sampling efficiency and reduces the number of stored parameters to approximately 10. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAS can significantly enhance existing fast solvers in a plug-and-play manner with negligible costs.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in graph representation learning over popular graph neural networks (GNNs). However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and graph properties, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, show that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and GNNs.

Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to capture intricate network patterns, achieving success across different domains. However, existing GNNs require careful domain-specific architecture designs and training from scratch on each dataset, leading to an expertise-intensive process with difficulty in generalizing across graphs from different domains. Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, "one model for one graph," which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both link prediction and node classification tasks.

Abstract: Combinatorial online learning is a fundamental task for selecting the optimal action (or super arm) as a combination of base arms in sequential interactions with systems providing stochastic rewards. It is applicable to diverse domains such as robotics, social advertising, network routing, and recommendation systems. In many real-world scenarios, we often encounter rising rewards, where playing a base arm not only provides an instantaneous reward but also contributes to the enhancement of future rewards, e.g., robots enhancing proficiency through practice and social influence strengthening in the history of successful recommendations. Moreover, the enhancement of a single base arm may affect multiple super arms that include it, introducing complex dependencies that are not captured by existing rising bandit models. To address this, we introduce the Combinatorial Rising Bandit (CRB) framework and propose a provably efficient algorithm, Combinatorial Rising Upper Confidence Bound (CRUCB). We establish an upper bound on regret CRUCB and show that it is nearly tight by deriving a matching lower bound. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CRUCB not only in synthetic environments but also in realistic applications of deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Flow matching models have emerged as a powerful method for generative modeling on domains like images or videos, and even on irregular or unstructured data like 3D point clouds or even protein structures. These models are commonly trained in two stages: first, a data compressor is trained, and in a subsequent training stage a flow matching generative model is trained in the latent space of the data compressor. This two-stage paradigm sets obstacles for unifying models across data domains, as hand-crafted compressors architectures are used for different data modalities. To this end, we introduce INRFlow, a domain-agnostic approach to learn flow matching transformers directly in ambient space. Drawing inspiration from INRs, we introduce a conditionally independent point-wise training objective that enables INRFlow to make predictions continuously in coordinate space. Our empirical results demonstrate that INRFlow effectively handles different data modalities such as images, 3D point clouds and protein structure data, achieving strong performance in different domains and outperforming comparable approaches. INRFlow is a promising step towards domain-agnostic flow matching generative models that can be trivially adopted in different data domains.

Abstract: Shock waves caused by earthquakes can be devastating. Generating realistic earthquake-caused ground motion waveforms help reducing losses in lives and properties, yet generative models for the task tend to generate subpar waveforms. We present High-fidelity Earthquake Groundmotion Generation System (HEGGS) and demonstrate its superior performance using earthquakes from North American, East Asian, and European regions. HEGGS exploits the intrinsic characteristics of earthquake dataset and learns the waveforms using an end-to-end differentiable generator containing conditional latent diffusion model and hi-fidelity waveform construction model. We show the learning efficiency of HEGGS by training it on a single GPU machine and validate its performance using earthquake databases from North America, East Asia, and Europe, using diverse criteria from waveform generation tasks and seismology. Once trained, HEGGS can generate three dimensional E-N-Z seismic waveforms with accurate P/S phase arrivals, envelope correlation, signal-to-noise ratio, GMPE analysis, frequency content analysis, and section plot analysis.

Abstract: This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze financial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in performing complex tasks. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been effective in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is susceptible to spurious correlations in reward modeling. Consequently, it often introduces biases-such as length bias, sycophancy, conceptual bias, and discrimination-that hinder the model's ability to capture true causal relationships. To address this, we propose a novel causal reward modeling approach that integrates causality to mitigate these spurious correlations. Our method enforces counterfactual invariance, ensuring reward predictions remain consistent when irrelevant variables are altered. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our approach mitigates various types of spurious correlations effectively, resulting in more reliable and fair alignment of LLMs with human preferences. As a drop-in enhancement to the existing RLHF workflow, our causal reward modeling provides a practical way to improve the trustworthiness and fairness of LLM finetuning.

Abstract: Credit risk management within supply chains has emerged as a critical research area due to its significant implications for operational stability and financial sustainability. The intricate interdependencies among supply chain participants mean that credit risks can propagate across networks, with impacts varying by industry. This study explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance credit risk identification in supply chains. GANs enable the generation of synthetic credit risk scenarios, addressing challenges related to data scarcity and imbalanced datasets. By leveraging GAN-generated data, the model improves predictive accuracy while effectively capturing dynamic and temporal dependencies in supply chain data. The research focuses on three representative industries-manufacturing (steel), distribution (pharmaceuticals), and services (e-commerce) to assess industry-specific credit risk contagion. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-based model outperforms traditional methods, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, achieving superior accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. The findings underscore the potential of GANs in proactive risk management, offering robust tools for mitigating financial disruptions in supply chains. Future research could expand the model by incorporating external market factors and supplier relationships to further enhance predictive capabilities.

Abstract: Advanced sensors and IoT devices have improved the monitoring and control of complex industrial enterprises. They have also created an interdependent fabric of geographically distributed process operations (clients) across these enterprises. Granger causality is an effective approach to detect and quantify interdependencies by examining how one client's state affects others over time. Understanding these interdependencies captures how localized events, such as faults and disruptions, can propagate throughout the system, possibly causing widespread operational impacts. However, the large volume and complexity of industrial data pose challenges in modeling these interdependencies. This paper develops a federated approach to learning Granger causality. We utilize a linear state space system framework that leverages low-dimensional state estimates to analyze interdependencies. This addresses bandwidth limitations and the computational burden commonly associated with centralized data processing. We propose augmenting the client models with the Granger causality information learned by the server through a Machine Learning (ML) function. We examine the co-dependence between the augmented client and server models and reformulate the framework as a standalone ML algorithm providing conditions for its sublinear and linear convergence rates. We also study the convergence of the framework to a centralized oracle model. Moreover, we include a differential privacy analysis to ensure data security while preserving causal insights. Using synthetic data, we conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness of our approach to perturbations in causality, the scalability to the size of communication, number of clients, and the dimensions of raw data. We also evaluate the performance on two real-world industrial control system datasets by reporting the volume of data saved by decentralization.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of AI systems has made understanding their behavior critical. Numerous interpretability methods have been developed to attribute model behavior to three key aspects: input features, training data, and internal model components, which emerged from explainable AI, data-centric AI, and mechanistic interpretability, respectively. However, these attribution methods are studied and applied rather independently, resulting in a fragmented landscape of methods and terminology. This position paper argues that feature, data, and component attribution methods share fundamental similarities, and a unified view of them benefits both interpretability and broader AI research. To this end, we first analyze popular methods for these three types of attributions and present a unified view demonstrating that these seemingly distinct methods employ similar techniques (such as perturbations, gradients, and linear approximations) over different aspects and thus differ primarily in their perspectives rather than techniques. Then, we demonstrate how this unified view enhances understanding of existing attribution methods, highlights shared concepts and evaluation criteria among these methods, and leads to new research directions both in interpretability research, by addressing common challenges and facilitating cross-attribution innovation, and in AI more broadly, with applications in model editing, steering, and regulation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose norm-bounded low-rank adaptation (NB-LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine tuning. NB-LoRA is a novel parameterization of low-rank weight adaptations that admits explicit bounds on each singular value of the adaptation matrix, which can thereby satisfy any prescribed unitarily invariant norm bound, including the Schatten norms (e.g., nuclear, Frobenius, spectral norm). The proposed parameterization is unconstrained, smooth, and complete, i.e. it covers all matrices satisfying the prescribed rank and singular-value bounds. Comparative experiments on large language models show that NB-LoRA achieves superior adaptation performance and faster training over a range of models, tasks and ranks. Vision fine-tuning experiments show that NB-LoRA can achieve strong adaptation performance while avoiding model catastrophic forgetting, and compared to existing approaches it is substantially more robust to a hyper-parameters such as including adaptation rank, learning rate and number of training epochs.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a fundamental sequential decision-making framework, extensively studied over the past decade. However, existing work primarily focuses on the online setting, overlooking the substantial costs of online interactions and the readily available offline datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Off-CMAB, the first offline learning framework for CMAB. Central to our framework is the combinatorial lower confidence bound (CLCB) algorithm, which combines pessimistic reward estimations with combinatorial solvers. To characterize the quality of offline datasets, we propose two novel data coverage conditions and prove that, under these conditions, CLCB achieves a near-optimal suboptimality gap, matching the theoretical lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. We validate Off-CMAB through practical applications, including learning to rank, large language model (LLM) caching, and social influence maximization, showing its ability to handle nonlinear reward functions, general feedback models, and out-of-distribution action samples that excludes optimal or even feasible actions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets further highlight the superior performance of CLCB.

Abstract: Symmetry in the parameter space of deep neural networks (DNNs) has proven beneficial for various deep learning applications. A well-known example is the permutation symmetry in Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), where permuting the rows of weight matrices in one layer and applying the inverse permutation to adjacent layers yields a functionally equivalent model. While permutation symmetry fully characterizes the equivalence set for MLPs, its discrete nature limits its utility for transformers. In this paper, we introduce rotation symmetry, a novel form of parameter space symmetry for transformers that generalizes permutation symmetry by rotating parameter matrices in self-attention layers. Unlike permutation symmetry, rotation symmetry operates in a continuous domain, thereby significantly expanding the equivalence set for transformers. Based on this property, we propose a theoretically optimal parameter matching algorithm as a plug-and-play module to enhance model fusion. We evaluate our approach using pre-trained transformers across diverse natural language and vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our rotation symmetry-based matching algorithm substantially improves model fusion, highlighting the potential of parameter space symmetry to facilitate model fusion.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control often requires large amounts of online interaction data. Value-based RL methods can mitigate this burden by offering relatively high sample efficiency. Some studies further enhance sample efficiency by incorporating offline demonstration data to "kick-start" training, achieving promising results in continuous control. However, they typically compute the Q-function independently for each action dimension, neglecting interdependencies and making it harder to identify optimal actions when learning from suboptimal data, such as non-expert demonstration and online-collected data during the training process. To address these issues, we propose Auto-Regressive Soft Q-learning (ARSQ), a value-based RL algorithm that models Q-values in a coarse-to-fine, auto-regressive manner. First, ARSQ decomposes the continuous action space into discrete spaces in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, enhancing sample efficiency for fine-grained continuous control tasks. Next, it auto-regressively predicts dimensional action advantages within each decision step, enabling more effective decision-making in continuous control tasks. We evaluate ARSQ on two continuous control benchmarks, RLBench and D4RL, integrating demonstration data into online training. On D4RL, which includes non-expert demonstrations, ARSQ achieves an average $1.62\times$ performance improvement over SOTA value-based baseline. On RLBench, which incorporates expert demonstrations, ARSQ surpasses various baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning from suboptimal online-collected data.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks has become a central focus in scientific machine learning. Training neural networks for singularly perturbed problems is particularly challenging due to certain parameters in the PDEs that introduce near-singularities in the loss function. In this study, we overcome this challenge by introducing a novel method based on homotopy dynamics to effectively manipulate these parameters. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze the effects of these parameters on training difficulty in these singularly perturbed problems and establish the convergence of the proposed homotopy dynamics method. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence and improves the accuracy of these singularly perturbed problems. These findings present an efficient optimization strategy leveraging homotopy dynamics, offering a robust framework to extend the applicability of neural networks for solving singularly perturbed differential equations.

Abstract: Neural network-based optimal transport (OT) is a recent and fruitful direction in the generative modeling community. It finds its applications in various fields such as domain translation, image super-resolution, computational biology and others. Among the existing OT approaches, of considerable interest are adversarial minimax solvers based on semi-dual formulations of OT problems. While promising, these methods lack theoretical investigation from a statistical learning perspective. Our work fills this gap by establishing upper bounds on the generalization error of an approximate OT map recovered by the minimax quadratic OT solver. Importantly, the bounds we derive depend solely on some standard statistical and mathematical properties of the considered functional classes (neural nets). While our analysis focuses on the quadratic OT, we believe that similar bounds could be derived for general OT case, paving the promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant attention due to its profound implications for social security. While existing approaches have contributed to understanding cross-modal consistency, they often fail to leverage modal-specific representations and explicit discrepant features. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Inverse Attention Network (MIAN), a novel framework that explores intrinsic discriminative features based on news content to advance fake news detection. Specifically, MIAN introduces a hierarchical learning module that captures diverse intra-modal relationships through local-to-global and local-to-local interactions, thereby generating enhanced unimodal representations to improve the identification of fake news at the intra-modal level. Additionally, a cross-modal interaction module employs a co-attention mechanism to establish and model dependencies between the refined unimodal representations, facilitating seamless semantic integration across modalities. To explicitly extract inconsistency features, we propose an inverse attention mechanism that effectively highlights the conflicting patterns and semantic deviations introduced by fake news in both intra- and inter-modality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its pivotal contribution to advancing social security through enhanced multimodal fake news detection.

Abstract: Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time-series-specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We study the policy evaluation problem in an online multi-reward multi-policy discounted setting, where multiple reward functions must be evaluated simultaneously for different policies. We adopt an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC perspective to achieve $\epsilon$-accurate estimates with high confidence across finite or convex sets of rewards, a setting that has not been investigated in the literature. Building on prior work on Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification, we adapt the MR-NaS exploration scheme to jointly minimize sample complexity for evaluating different policies across different reward sets. Our approach leverages an instance-specific lower bound revealing how the sample complexity scales with a measure of value deviation, guiding the design of an efficient exploration policy. Although computing this bound entails a hard non-convex optimization, we propose an efficient convex approximation that holds for both finite and convex reward sets. Experiments in tabular domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive exploration scheme.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) play an integral role in driving critical decisions in disease management and patient care. While recent innovations have led to specialized models for various CXR interpretation tasks, these solutions often operate in isolation, limiting their practical utility in clinical practice. We present MedRAX, the first versatile AI agent that seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art CXR analysis tools and multimodal large language models into a unified framework. MedRAX dynamically leverages these models to address complex medical queries without requiring additional training. To rigorously evaluate its capabilities, we introduce ChestAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 2,500 complex medical queries across 7 diverse categories. Our experiments demonstrate that MedRAX achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both open-source and proprietary models, representing a significant step toward the practical deployment of automated CXR interpretation systems.

Abstract: Behavior regularization, which constrains the policy to stay close to some behavior policy, is widely used in offline reinforcement learning (RL) to manage the risk of hazardous exploitation of unseen actions. Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though originally designed for generative tasks, have demonstrated impressive self-supervised representation learning capabilities. A particularly intriguing phenomenon in these models is the emergence of unimodal representation dynamics, where the quality of learned features peaks at an intermediate noise level. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigation of this phenomenon. Leveraging the inherent low-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that the unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the underlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between denoising strength and class confidence across noise scales. Empirically, we further show that, in classification tasks, the presence of unimodal dynamics reliably indicates generalization: it emerges when the model generalizes and gradually transitions to a monotonically decreasing curve as the model begins to memorize the training data.

Abstract: We study the problem of preconditioning in the setting of sequential prediction. From the theoretical lens of linear dynamical systems, we show that applying a convolution to the input sequence translates to applying a polynomial to the unknown transition matrix in the hidden space. With this insight, we develop a novel preconditioning method that convolves the input sequence with the coefficients of the Chebyshev or Legendre polynomials. We formally prove that this improves the regret of two distinct prediction methods. Moreover, using this preconditioning technique on either method gives the first sublinear regret bounds that are also hidden dimension independent (up to logarithmic factors) even when the hidden transition matrix is asymmetric. From rigorous experiments on synthetic data we show that our simple preconditioning method generalizes to both 1) settings where the data is not from a linear dynamical system and 2) a broad range of learning algorithms, including recurrent neural networks.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a class of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate information across the graph via local neighborhoods. The scheme gives rise to two key challenges: over-smoothing and over-squashing. While several Dropout-style algorithms, such as DropEdge and DropMessage, have successfully addressed over-smoothing, their impact on over-squashing remains largely unexplored. This represents a critical gap in the literature, as failure to mitigate over-squashing would make these methods unsuitable for long-range tasks -- the intended use case of deep MPNNs. In this work, we study the aforementioned algorithms, and closely related edge-dropping algorithms -- DropNode, DropAgg and DropGNN -- in the context of over-squashing. We present theoretical results showing that DropEdge-variants reduce sensitivity between distant nodes, limiting their suitability for long-range tasks. To address this, we introduce DropSens, a sensitivity-aware variant of DropEdge that explicitly controls the proportion of information lost due to edge-dropping, thereby increasing sensitivity to distant nodes despite dropping the same number of edges. Our experiments on long-range synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the predicted limitations of existing edge-dropping and feature-dropping methods. Moreover, DropSens consistently outperforms graph rewiring techniques designed to mitigate over-squashing, suggesting that simple, targeted modifications can substantially improve a model's ability to capture long-range interactions. Our conclusions highlight the need to re-evaluate and re-design existing methods for training deep GNNs, with a renewed focus on modelling long-range interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities but come with significant environmental impact, particularly in carbon emissions. Existing studies benchmark carbon emissions but lack a standardized basis for comparison across different model configurations. To address this, we introduce the concept of functional unit (FU) as a standardized basis and develop FUEL, the first FU-based framework for evaluating LLM serving's environmental impact. Through three case studies, we uncover key insights and trade-offs in reducing carbon emissions by optimizing model size, quantization strategy, and hardware choice, paving the way for more sustainable LLM serving.

<title>A Signed Graph Approach to Understanding and Mitigating Oversmoothing in GNNs</title>

Abstract: Deep graph neural networks (GNNs) often suffer from oversmoothing, where node representations become overly homogeneous with increasing depth. While techniques like normalization, residual connections, and edge dropout have been proposed to mitigate oversmoothing, they are typically developed independently, with limited theoretical understanding of their underlying mechanisms. In this work, we present a unified theoretical perspective based on the framework of signed graphs, showing that many existing strategies implicitly introduce negative edges that alter message-passing to resist oversmoothing. However, we show that merely adding negative edges in an unstructured manner is insufficient-the asymptotic behavior of signed propagation depends critically on the strength and organization of positive and negative edges. To address this limitation, we leverage the theory of structural balance, which promotes stable, cluster-preserving dynamics by connecting similar nodes with positive edges and dissimilar ones with negative edges. We propose Structural Balanced Propagation (SBP), a plug-and-play method that assigns signed edges based on either labels or feature similarity to explicitly enhance structural balance in the constructed signed graphs. Experiments on nine benchmarks across both homophilic and heterophilic settings demonstrate that SBP consistently improves classification accuracy and mitigates oversmoothing, even at depths of up to 300 layers. Our results provide a principled explanation for prior oversmoothing remedies and introduce a new direction for signed message-passing design in deep GNNs.

Abstract: The high cost of data labeling presents a major barrier to deploying machine learning systems at scale. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this challenge by utilizing unlabeled data alongside limited labeled examples, while the emergence of foundation models (FMs) offers powerful zero-shot capabilities that can further reduce labeling cost. However, directly fine-tuning large FMs is often impractical in resource-constrained settings, and na\"ively using their pseudo-labels for unlabeled data can degrade performance due to its unreliablity or domain mismatch with target task. In this work, we introduce ZeroMatch, a novel SSL framework that integrates knowledge distillation with consistency-based learning to jointly leverage labeled data, unlabeled data, and pseudo-labels from FMs. ZeroMatch enables training compact student models using only FM inference, making it suitable for low-resource environments such as personal devices with limited compute. Experiments on six vision and language classification benchmarks show that ZeroMatch consistently outperforms standard SSL and zero-shot augmented methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across a range of foundation model qualities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning technologies have achieved remarkable results. However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.

Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) encode rich, structured information critical for drug discovery tasks, but extracting meaningful insights from large-scale KGs remains challenging due to their complex structure. Existing biomedical subgraph retrieval methods are tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), limiting compatibility with other paradigms, including large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a model-agnostic retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful multi-hop paths from dense biomedical KGs. These paths enable the prediction of unobserved drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, including those involving entities not seen during training, thus supporting inductive reasoning. K-Paths is training-free and employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to extract the K shortest loopless paths between entities in a query, prioritizing biologically relevant and relationally diverse connections. These paths serve as concise, interpretable reasoning chains that can be directly integrated with LLMs or GNNs to improve generalization, accuracy, and enable explainable inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves zero-shot reasoning across state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by 19.8 and 4.0 F1 points on interaction severity prediction and drug repurposing tasks, respectively. Llama 70B achieves gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same tasks. K-Paths also boosts the training efficiency of EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN, by reducing the KG size by 90% while maintaining predictive performance. Beyond efficiency, K-Paths bridges the gap between KGs and LLMs, enabling scalable and explainable LLM-augmented scientific discovery. We release our code and the retrieved paths as a benchmark for inductive reasoning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.

Abstract: Scaling up the model size and computation has brought consistent performance improvements in supervised learning. However, this lesson often fails to apply to reinforcement learning (RL) because training the model on non-stationary data easily leads to overfitting and unstable optimization. In response, we introduce SimbaV2, a novel RL architecture designed to stabilize optimization by (i) constraining the growth of weight and feature norm by hyperspherical normalization; and (ii) using a distributional value estimation with reward scaling to maintain stable gradients under varying reward magnitudes. Using the soft actor-critic as a base algorithm, SimbaV2 scales up effectively with larger models and greater compute, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 57 continuous control tasks across 4 domains.

Abstract: Solving complex tasks in a single attempt is challenging for large language models (LLMs). Iterative interaction with the environment and feedback is often required to achieve success, making effective feedback utilization a critical topic. Existing approaches either struggle with length generalization or rely on naive retries without leveraging prior information. In this paper, we introduce FTTT, a novel paradigm that formulates feedback utilization as an optimization problem at test time. Additionally, we propose a learnable test-time optimizer, OpTune, to effectively exploit feedback. Experiments on two LLMs across four reasoning datasets demonstrate that FTTT and OpTune achieve superior scalability and performance.

Abstract: Edge inference (EI) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address the growing limitations of cloud-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference services, such as high response latency, limited scalability, and severe data privacy exposure. However, deploying DNN models on resource-constrained edge devices introduces additional challenges, including limited computation/storage resources, dynamic service demands, and heightened privacy risks. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-aware optimization framework that jointly addresses DNN model deployment, user-server association, and model partitioning, with the goal of minimizing long-term average inference delay under resource and privacy constraints. The problem is formulated as a complex, NP-hard stochastic optimization. To efficiently handle system dynamics and computational complexity, we employ a Lyapunov-based approach to transform the long-term objective into tractable per-slot decisions. Furthermore, we introduce a coalition formation game to enable adaptive user-server association and design a greedy algorithm for model deployment within each coalition. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces inference delay and consistently satisfies privacy constraints, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep networks, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). This work asks whether a similar replacement in the attention can bring benefits. In this paper, we design the first learnable attention called Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for ViTs that can operate on any basis, ranging from Fourier, Wavelets, Splines, to Rational Functions. However, learnable activations in attention cause a memory explosion. To remedy this, we propose a modular version of KArAt that uses a low-rank approximation. By adopting the Fourier basis, Fourier-KArAt and its variants, in some cases, outperform their traditional softmax counterparts, or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We also deploy Fourier KArAt to ConViT and Swin-Transformer, and use it in detection and segmentation with ViT-Det. We dissect these architectures' performance by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and transferability to other datasets. KArAt's learnable activation shows a better attention score across all ViTs, indicating better token-to-token interactions, contributing to better inference. Still, its generalizability does not scale with larger ViTs. However, many factors, including the present computing interface, affect the performance of parameter- and memory-heavy KArAts. We note that the goal of this paper is not to produce efficient attention or challenge the traditional activations; by designing KArAt, we are the first to show that attention can be learned and encourage researchers to explore KArAt in conjunction with more advanced architectures.

Abstract: Effective uncertainty quantification is important for training modern predictive models with limited data, enhancing both accuracy and robustness. While Bayesian methods are effective for this purpose, they can be challenging to scale. When employing approximate Bayesian inference, ensuring the quality of samples from the posterior distribution in a computationally efficient manner is essential. This paper addresses the estimation of the Bayesian posterior to generate diverse samples by approximating the gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the cross entropy of the target approximation under the metric induced by the Stein Operator. It presents empirical evaluations on classification tasks to assess the method's performance and discuss its effectiveness for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning that uses uncertainty-aware network dynamics models.

Abstract: The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.

Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively. Based on a new surrogate loss function enforcing a minimum penalty on the constraint function, we demonstrate that both the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader and the Online Gradient Descent achieve the optimal bounds.

Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) classification is crucial for improved diagnosis in healthcare, and yet it is challenging due to the varying granularity of patterns, intricate inter-channel correlation, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While existing transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, they mainly focus on forecasting and fail to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of MedTS data. In this paper, we introduce Sparseformer, a transformer specifically designed for MedTS classification. We propose a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global modeling and token compression, allowing dynamic focus on the most informative tokens while distilling redundant features. This mechanism is then applied to the multi-granularity, cross-channel encoding of medical signals, capturing intra- and inter-granularity correlations and inter-channel connections. The sparsification design allows our model to handle heterogeneous inputs of varying lengths and channels directly. Further, we introduce an adaptive label encoder to address label space misalignment across datasets, equipping our model with cross-dataset transferability to alleviate the medical label scarcity issue. Our model outperforms 12 baselines across seven medical datasets under supervised learning. In the few-shot learning experiments, our model also achieves superior average results. In addition, the in-domain and cross-domain experiments among three diagnostic scenarios demonstrate our model's zero-shot learning capability. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and transferability of our model in various medical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

<title>Are Domain Generalization Benchmarks with Accuracy on the Line Misspecified?</title>

Abstract: Spurious correlations are unstable statistical associations that hinder robust decision-making. Conventional wisdom suggests that models relying on such correlations will fail to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD), especially under strong distribution shifts. However, empirical evidence challenges this view as naive in-distribution empirical risk minimizers often achieve the best OOD accuracy across popular OOD generalization benchmarks. In light of these results, we propose a different perspective: many widely used benchmarks for evaluating robustness to spurious correlations are misspecified. Specifically, they fail to include shifts in spurious correlations that meaningfully impact OOD generalization, making them unsuitable for evaluating the benefit of removing such correlations. We establish conditions under which a distribution shift can reliably assess a model's reliance on spurious correlations. Crucially, under these conditions, we should not observe a strong positive correlation between in-distribution and OOD accuracy, often called "accuracy on the line." Yet, most state-of-the-art benchmarks exhibit this pattern, suggesting they do not effectively assess robustness. Our findings expose a key limitation in current benchmarks used to evaluate domain generalization algorithms, that is, models designed to avoid spurious correlations. We highlight the need to rethink how robustness to spurious correlations is assessed, identify well-specified benchmarks the field should prioritize, and enumerate strategies for designing future benchmarks that meaningfully reflect robustness under distribution shift.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as a biologically plausible alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), have demonstrated advantages in terms of energy efficiency, temporal processing, and biological plausibility. However, SNNs are highly sensitive to distribution shifts, which can significantly degrade their performance in real-world scenarios. Traditional test-time adaptation (TTA) methods designed for ANNs often fail to address the unique computational dynamics of SNNs, such as sparsity and temporal spiking behavior. To address these challenges, we propose SPike-Aware Consistency Enhancement (SPACE), the first source-free and single-instance TTA method specifically designed for SNNs. SPACE leverages the inherent spike dynamics of SNNs to maximize the consistency of spike-behavior-based local feature maps across augmented versions of a single test sample, enabling robust adaptation without requiring source data. We evaluate SPACE on multiple datasets. Furthermore, SPACE exhibits robust generalization across diverse network architectures, consistently enhancing the performance of SNNs on CNNs (such as VGG and ResNet), Transformer models, and ConvLSTM architectures. Experimental results show that SPACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) strives to learn incrementally across tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge in CL is balancing stability (retaining prior knowledge) and plasticity (learning new tasks). While representative gradient projection methods ensure stability, they often limit plasticity. Model merging techniques offer promising solutions, but prior methods typically rely on empirical assumptions and carefully selected hyperparameters. In this paper, we explore the potential of model merging to enhance the stability-plasticity trade-off, providing theoretical insights that underscore its benefits. Specifically, we reformulate the merging mechanism using Bayesian continual learning principles and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal merging coefficient that adapts to the diverse characteristics of tasks. To validate our approach, we introduce a two-stage framework named BECAME, which synergizes the expertise of gradient projection and adaptive merging. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods and existing merging strategies.

Abstract: We introduce Error Broadcast and Decorrelation (EBD), a novel learning framework for neural networks that addresses credit assignment by directly broadcasting output errors to individual layers, circumventing weight transport of backpropagation. EBD is rigorously grounded in the stochastic orthogonality property of Minimum Mean Square Error estimators. This fundamental principle states that the error of an optimal estimator is orthogonal to functions of the input. Guided by this insight, EBD defines layerwise loss functions that directly penalize correlations between layer activations and output errors, thereby establishing a principled foundation for error broadcasting. This theoretically sound mechanism naturally leads to the experimentally observed three-factor learning rule and integrates with biologically plausible frameworks to enhance performance and plausibility. Numerical experiments demonstrate EBD's competitive or better performance against other error-broadcast methods on benchmark datasets. Our findings establish EBD as an efficient, biologically plausible, and principled alternative for neural network training.

<title>A Combinatorial Theory of Dropout: Subnetworks, Graph Geometry, and Generalization</title>

Abstract: We propose a combinatorial and graph-theoretic theory of dropout by modeling training as a random walk over a high-dimensional graph of binary subnetworks. Each node represents a masked version of the network, and dropout induces stochastic traversal across this space. We define a subnetwork contribution score that quantifies generalization and show that it varies smoothly over the graph. Using tools from spectral graph theory, PAC-Bayes analysis, and combinatorics, we prove that generalizing subnetworks form large, connected, low-resistance clusters, and that their number grows exponentially with network width. This reveals dropout as a mechanism for sampling from a robust, structured ensemble of well-generalizing subnetworks with built-in redundancy. Extensive experiments validate every theoretical claim across diverse architectures. Together, our results offer a unified foundation for understanding dropout and suggest new directions for mask-guided regularization and subnetwork optimization.

<title>Learning to Reason under Off-Policy Guidance</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards~(\textit{RLVR}). However, existing \textit{RLVR} approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{LUFFY} (\textbf{L}earning to reason \textbf{U}nder o\textbf{FF}-polic\textbf{Y} guidance), a framework that augments \textit{RLVR} with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Specifically, LUFFY combines the Mixed-Policy GRPO framework, which has a theoretically guaranteed convergence rate, alongside policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Compared with previous RLVR methods, LUFFY achieves an over \textbf{+6.4} average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over \textbf{+6.2} points in out-of-distribution tasks. Most significantly, we show that LUFFY successfully trains weak models in scenarios where on-policy RLVR completely fails. These results provide compelling evidence that LUFFY transcends the fundamental limitations of on-policy RLVR and demonstrates the great potential of utilizing off-policy guidance in RLVR.

Abstract: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.

Abstract: The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at LensLLM.io.

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving f-divergences, yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or inadequately overlapping supports -- the density-chasm and the support-chasm problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We design $\textbf{D}^3\textbf{RE}$, a unified framework for robust, stable and efficient density ratio estimation. We propose the dequantified diffusion bridge interpolant (DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the proposed dequantified Schr{\"o}dinger bridge interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology reports.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods typically require that agents enjoy global state observability, preventing development of decentralized algorithms and limiting scalability. Recent work has shown that, under assumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be replaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling decentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay properties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power decay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many problems in wireless communications and radar networks. In this paper, we show that signal attenuation enables decentralization in MARL by considering the illustrative special case of performing power allocation for target detection in a radar network. To achieve this, we propose two new constrained multi-agent Markov decision process formulations of this power allocation problem, derive local neighborhood approximations for global value function and policy gradient estimates and establish corresponding error bounds, and develop decentralized saddle point policy gradient algorithms for solving the proposed problems. Our approach, though oriented towards the specific radar network problem we consider, provides a useful model for extensions to additional problems in wireless communications and radar networks.

Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization, and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths, widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression, regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.

Abstract: We present a complete theoretical and empirical framework establishing feedforward neural networks as universal finite-state machines (N-FSMs). Our results prove that finite-depth ReLU and threshold networks can exactly simulate deterministic finite automata (DFAs) by unrolling state transitions into depth-wise neural layers, with formal characterizations of required depth, width, and state compression. We demonstrate that DFA transitions are linearly separable, binary threshold activations allow exponential compression, and Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes can be embedded into continuous latent spaces while preserving separability. We also formalize the expressivity boundary: fixed-depth feedforward networks cannot recognize non-regular languages requiring unbounded memory. Unlike prior heuristic or probing-based studies, we provide constructive proofs and design explicit DFA-unrolled neural architectures that empirically validate every claim. Our results bridge deep learning, automata theory, and neural-symbolic computation, offering a rigorous blueprint for how discrete symbolic processes can be realized in continuous neural systems.

Abstract: The rapid increase in computing power and the ability to store Big Data in the infrastructure has enabled predictions in a large variety of domains by Machine Learning. However, in many cases, existing Machine Learning tools are considered insufficient or incorrect since they exploit only probabilistic dependencies rather than inference logic. Causal Machine Learning methods seem to close this gap. In this paper, two prevalent tools based on Causal Machine Learning methods are compared, as well as their mathematical underpinning background. The operation of the tools is demonstrated by examining their response to 18 queries, based on the IDEAL Household Energy Dataset, published by the University of Edinburgh. First, it was important to evaluate the causal relations assumption that allowed the use of this approach; this was based on the preexisting scientific knowledge of the domain and was implemented by use of the in-built validation tools. Results were encouraging and may easily be extended to other domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.

Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large datasets have been successfully used to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models comprising simple mathematical expressions, their findings cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge. Critics of machine learning's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key papers on interpretable machine learning from outside the scientific community and argue that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of interpretability for scientific machine learning (SciML), they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary. It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) models directly in low-precision offers a way to address computational costs by improving both throughput and energy efficiency. For those purposes, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell architecture facilitates very low-precision operations using FP4 variants. Yet, current algorithms for training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we investigate hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce a new approach for accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (i.e., linear layers) in low precision. Through extensive evaluations on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies performance trade-offs across bit-widths and training setups. Guided by this investigation, we design an "optimal" technique in terms of accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized CUDA kernels tailored for Blackwell, demonstrating that fully FP4-based training is a competitive alternative to FP16 half-precision and to FP8 training. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet.

Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS) issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by 10%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state, achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning rates.

<title>Improved and Oracle-Efficient Online $\ell_1$-Multicalibration</title>

Abstract: We study \emph{online multicalibration}, a framework for ensuring calibrated predictions across multiple groups in adversarial settings, across $T$ rounds. Although online calibration is typically studied in the $\ell_1$ norm, prior approaches to online multicalibration have taken the indirect approach of obtaining rates in other norms (such as $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$) and then transferred these guarantees to $\ell_1$ at additional loss. In contrast, we propose a direct method that achieves improved and oracle-efficient rates of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ respectively, for online $\ell_1$-multicalibration. Our key insight is a novel reduction of online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration to an online learning problem with product-based rewards, which we refer to as \emph{online linear-product optimization} ($\mathtt{OLPO}$).
  To obtain the improved rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, we introduce a linearization of $\mathtt{OLPO}$ and design a no-regret algorithm for this linearized problem. Although this method guarantees the desired sublinear rate (nearly matching the best rate for online calibration), it is computationally expensive when the group family \(\mathcal{H}\) is large or infinite, since it enumerates all possible groups. To address scalability, we propose a second approach to $\mathtt{OLPO}$ that makes only a polynomial number of calls to an offline optimization (\emph{multicalibration evaluation}) oracle, resulting in \emph{oracle-efficient} online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. Our framework also extends to certain infinite families of groups (e.g., all linear functions on the context space) by exploiting a $1$-Lipschitz property of the \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration error with respect to \(\mathcal{H}\).

Abstract: Reinforcement learning exhibits potential in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet it is hard to scale for the low sample efficiency during the rollout phase. Existing methods attempt to improve efficiency by scheduling problems based on problem difficulties. However, these approaches suffer from unstable and biased estimations of problem difficulty and fail to capture the alignment between model competence and problem difficulty in RL training, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces $\textbf{C}$ompetence-$\textbf{D}$ifficulty $\textbf{A}$lignment $\textbf{S}$ampling ($\textbf{CDAS}$), which enables accurate and stable estimation of problem difficulties by aggregating historical performance discrepancies of problems. Then the model competence is quantified to adaptively select problems whose difficulty is in alignment with the model's current competence using a fixed-point system. Experimental results across a range of challenging mathematical benchmarks show that CDAS achieves great improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. CDAS attains the highest average accuracy against baselines and exhibits significant speed advantages compared to Dynamic Sampling, a competitive strategy in DAPO, which is 2.33 times slower than CDAS.

Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), training the Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), have demonstrated enhanced exploration capabilities and greater robustness than using traditional policy gradient. However, ERL suffers from the high computational costs and low search efficiency, as EAs require evaluating numerous candidate policies with expensive simulations, many of which are ineffective and do not contribute meaningfully to the training. One intuitive way to reduce the ineffective evaluations is to adopt the surrogates. Unfortunately, existing ERL policies are often modeled as deep neural networks (DNNs) and thus naturally represented as high-dimensional vectors containing millions of weights, which makes the building of effective surrogates for ERL policies extremely challenging. This paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted ERL that integrates Autoencoders (AE) and Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNN). Specifically, AE compresses high-dimensional policies into low-dimensional representations while extracting key features as the inputs for the surrogate. HNN, functioning as a classification-based surrogate model, can learn complex nonlinear relationships from sampled data and enable more accurate pre-selection of the sampled policies without real evaluations. The experiments on 10 Atari and 4 Mujoco games have verified that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches significantly. The search trajectories guided by AE and HNN are also visually demonstrated to be more effective, in terms of both exploration and convergence. This paper not only presents the first learnable policy embedding and surrogate-modeling modules for high-dimensional ERL policies, but also empirically reveals when and why they can be successful.

Abstract: Dynamics modeling has been introduced as a novel paradigm in message passing (MP) of graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing methods consider MP between nodes as a heat diffusion process, and leverage heat equation to model the temporal evolution of nodes in the embedding space. However, heat equation can hardly depict the wave nature of graph signals in graph signal processing. Besides, heat equation is essentially a partial differential equation (PDE) involving a first partial derivative of time, whose numerical solution usually has low stability, and leads to inefficient model training. In this paper, we would like to depict more wave details in MP, since graph signals are essentially wave signals that can be seen as a superposition of a series of waves in the form of eigenvector. This motivates us to consider MP as a wave propagation process to capture the temporal evolution of wave signals in the space. Based on wave equation in physics, we innovatively develop a graph wave equation to leverage the wave propagation on graphs. In details, we demonstrate that the graph wave equation can be connected to traditional spectral GNNs, facilitating the design of graph wave networks based on various Laplacians and enhancing the performance of the spectral GNNs. Besides, the graph wave equation is particularly a PDE involving a second partial derivative of time, which has stronger stability on graphs than the heat equation that involves a first partial derivative of time. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the numerical solution derived from the graph wave equation are constantly stable, enabling to significantly enhance model efficiency while ensuring its performance. Extensive experiments show that GWNs achieve SOTA and efficient performance on benchmark datasets, and exhibit outstanding performance in addressing challenging graph problems, such as over-smoothing and heterophily.

<title>Ensuring User-side Fairness in Dynamic Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: User-side group fairness is crucial for modern recommender systems, aiming to alleviate performance disparities among user groups defined by sensitive attributes like gender, race, or age. In the ever-evolving landscape of user-item interactions, continual adaptation to newly collected data is crucial for recommender systems to stay aligned with the latest user preferences. However, we observe that such continual adaptation often exacerbates performance disparities. This necessitates a thorough investigation into user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems, an area that has been unexplored in the literature. This problem is challenging due to distribution shifts, frequent model updates, and non-differentiability of ranking metrics. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first principled study on ensuring user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems. We start with theoretical analyses on fine-tuning v.s. retraining, showing that the best practice is incremental fine-tuning with restart. Guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose FAir Dynamic rEcommender (FADE), an end-to-end fine-tuning framework to dynamically ensure user-side fairness over time. To overcome the non-differentiability of recommendation metrics in the fairness loss, we further introduce Differentiable Hit (DH) as an improvement over the recent NeuralNDCG method, not only alleviating its gradient vanishing issue but also achieving higher efficiency. Besides that, we also address the instability issue of the fairness loss by leveraging the competing nature between the recommendation loss and the fairness loss. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FADE effectively and efficiently reduces performance disparities with little sacrifice in the overall recommendation performance.

Abstract: Agents built with large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of domains. However, in complex decision-making tasks, pure LLM-based agents tend to exhibit intrinsic bias in their choice of actions, which is inherited from the model's training data and results in suboptimal performance. To develop strategic language agents, i.e., agents that generate flexible language actions and possess strong decision-making abilities, we propose a novel framework that powers LLM-based agents with reinforcement learning (RL). We consider Werewolf, a popular social deduction game, as a challenging testbed that emphasizes versatile communication and strategic gameplay. To mitigate the intrinsic bias in language actions, our agents use an LLM to perform deductive reasoning and generate a diverse set of action candidates. Then an RL policy trained to optimize the decision-making ability chooses an action from the candidates to play in the game. Extensive experiments show that our agents overcome the intrinsic bias and outperform existing LLM-based agents in the Werewolf game. We also conduct human-agent experiments and find that our agents achieve human-level performance and demonstrate strong strategic play.

<title>A Straightforward Gradient-Based Approach for High-Tc Superconductor Design: Leveraging Domain Knowledge via Adaptive Constraints</title>

Abstract: Materials design aims to discover novel compounds with desired properties. However, prevailing strategies face critical trade-offs. Conventional element-substitution approaches readily and adaptively incorporate various domain knowledge but remain confined to a narrow search space. In contrast, deep generative models efficiently explore vast compositional landscapes, yet they struggle to flexibly integrate domain knowledge. To address these trade-offs, we propose a gradient-based material design framework that combines these strengths, offering both efficiency and adaptability. In our method, chemical compositions are optimised to achieve target properties by using property prediction models and their gradients. In order to seamlessly enforce diverse constraints, including those reflecting domain insights such as oxidation states, discretised compositional ratios, types of elements, and their abundance, we apply masks and employ a special loss function, namely the integer loss. Furthermore, we initialise the optimisation using promising candidates from existing dataset, effectively guiding the search away from unfavourable regions and thus helping to avoid poor solutions. Our approach demonstrates a more efficient exploration of superconductor candidates, uncovering candidate materials with higher critical temperature than conventional element-substitution and generative models. Importantly, it could propose new compositions beyond those found in existing databases, including new hydride superconductors absent from the training dataset but which share compositional similarities with materials found in literature. This synergy of domain knowledge and machine-learning-based scalability provides a robust foundation for rapid, adaptive, and comprehensive materials design for superconductors and beyond.

Abstract: A/B testing has become the gold standard for policy evaluation in modern technological industries. Motivated by the widespread use of switchback experiments in A/B testing, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various switchback designs in Markovian environments. Unlike many existing works which derive the optimal design based on specific and relatively simple estimators, our analysis covers a range of state-of-the-art estimators developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. It reveals that the effectiveness of different switchback designs depends crucially on (i) the size of the carryover effect and (ii) the auto-correlations among reward errors over time. Meanwhile, these findings are estimator-agnostic, i.e., they apply to most RL estimators. Based on these insights, we provide a workflow to offer guidelines for practitioners on designing switchback experiments in A/B testing.

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to detect, estimate, and analyze properties of people in images, including 3D pose, shape, contact, human-object interaction, and emotion. While widely applicable in vision and other areas, such methods require expert knowledge to select, use, and interpret the results. To address this, we introduce ChatHuman, a language-driven system that integrates the capabilities of specialized methods into a unified framework. ChatHuman functions as an assistant proficient in utilizing, analyzing, and interacting with tools specific to 3D human tasks, adeptly discussing and resolving related challenges. Built on a Large Language Model (LLM) framework, ChatHuman is trained to autonomously select, apply, and interpret a diverse set of tools in response to user inputs. Our approach overcomes significant hurdles in adapting LLMs to 3D human tasks, including the need for domain-specific knowledge and the ability to interpret complex 3D outputs. The innovations of ChatHuman include leveraging academic publications to instruct the LLM on tool usage, employing a retrieval-augmented generation model to create in-context learning examples for managing new tools, and effectively discriminating between and integrating tool results by transforming specialized 3D outputs into comprehensible formats. Experiments demonstrate that ChatHuman surpasses existing models in both tool selection accuracy and overall performance across various 3D human tasks, and it supports interactive chatting with users. ChatHuman represents a significant step toward consolidating diverse analytical methods into a unified, robust system for 3D human tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel Thompson sampling algorithm that learns linear quadratic regulators (LQR) with a Bayesian regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$. Our method leverages Langevin dynamics with a carefully designed preconditioner and incorporates a simple excitation mechanism. We show that the excitation signal drives the minimum eigenvalue of the preconditioner to grow over time, thereby accelerating the approximate posterior sampling process. Furthermore, we establish nontrivial concentration properties of the approximate posteriors generated by our algorithm. These properties enable us to bound the moments of the system state and attain an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound without relying on the restrictive assumptions that are often used in the literature.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides machine learning models with prediction sets that offer theoretical guarantees, but the underlying assumption of exchangeability limits its applicability to time series data. Furthermore, existing approaches struggle to handle multi-step ahead prediction tasks, where uncertainty estimates across multiple future time points are crucial. We propose JANET (Joint Adaptive predictioN-region Estimation for Time-series), a novel framework for constructing conformal prediction regions that are valid for both univariate and multivariate time series. JANET generalises the inductive conformal framework and efficiently produces joint prediction regions with controlled K-familywise error rates, enabling flexible adaptation to specific application needs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates JANET's superior performance in multi-step prediction tasks across diverse time series datasets, highlighting its potential for reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification in sequential data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, adapting LLMs to downstream applications requires computationally intensive and memory-demanding fine-tuning procedures. To alleviate these burdens, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as a promising approach to tailor LLMs with minimal computational overhead. While PEFT methods offer substantial advantages, they do not fully address the pervasive issue of bias propagation from pre-training data. This work introduces Bias-Alleviating Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel PEFT method designed to counteract bias inheritance. BA-LoRA incorporates three distinct regularization terms: (1) a consistency regularizer, (2) a diversity regularizer, and (3) a singular value decomposition regularizer. These regularizers aim to enhance the models' consistency, diversity, and generalization capabilities during fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks using prominent LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma. The results demonstrate that BA-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants. Moreover, the extended experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the adverse effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model outputs. The code is available at https://github.com/cyp-jlu-ai/BA-LoRA.

Abstract: We revisit the recently introduced Local Glivenko-Cantelli setting, which studies distribution-dependent uniform convergence rates of the Empirical Mean Estimator (EME). In this work, we investigate generalizations of this setting where arbitrary estimators are allowed rather than just the EME. Can a strictly larger class of measures be learned? Can better risk decay rates be obtained? We provide exhaustive answers to these questions, which are both negative, provided the learner is barred from exploiting some infinite-dimensional pathologies. On the other hand, allowing such exploits does lead to a strictly larger class of learnable measures.

Abstract: We propose M3Bench, a new benchmark for whole-body motion generation in mobile manipulation tasks. Given a 3D scene context, M3Bench requires an embodied agent to reason about its configuration, environmental constraints, and task objectives to generate coordinated whole-body motion trajectories for object rearrangement. M3Bench features 30,000 object rearrangement tasks across 119 diverse scenes, providing expert demonstrations generated by our newly developed M3BenchMaker, an automatic data generation tool that produces whole-body motion trajectories from high-level task instructions using only basic scene and robot information. Our benchmark includes various task splits to evaluate generalization across different dimensions and leverages realistic physics simulation for trajectory assessment. Extensive evaluation analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle with coordinating base-arm motion while adhering to environmental and task-specific constraints, underscoring the need for new models to bridge this gap. By releasing M3Bench and M3BenchMaker we aim to advance robotics research toward more adaptive and capable mobile manipulation in diverse, real-world environments.

Abstract: Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials design by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained property predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is hindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such as charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local minima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these issues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and template-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid poor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without retraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional targets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal systems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced with gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five target properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and Bayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite structures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at which the other methods fail entirely.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has revitalized Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting non-parametric factual knowledge. Compared with long-context LLMs, RAG is considered an effective summarization tool in a more concise and lightweight manner, which can interact with LLMs multiple times using diverse queries to get comprehensive responses. However, the LLM-generated historical responses, which contain potentially insightful information, are largely neglected and discarded by existing approaches, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose $\textit{graph of records}$ ($\textbf{GoR}$), which leverages historical responses generated by LLMs to enhance RAG for long-context global summarization. Inspired by the $\textit{retrieve-then-generate}$ paradigm of RAG, we construct a graph by establishing an edge between the retrieved text chunks and the corresponding LLM-generated response. To further uncover the intricate correlations between them, GoR features a $\textit{graph neural network}$ and an elaborately designed $\textit{BERTScore}$-based objective for self-supervised model training, enabling seamless supervision signal backpropagation between reference summaries and node embeddings. We comprehensively compare GoR with 12 baselines across four long-context summarization datasets, and the results indicate that our proposed method reaches the best performance ($\textit{e.g.}$, 15%, 8%, and 19% improvement over retrievers w.r.t. Rouge-L, Rouge-1, and Rouge-2 on the WCEP dataset). Extensive experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of GoR.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding empirical performance in machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in generating high-quality new samples from complex probability distributions. Improving the theoretical understanding of diffusion models, with a particular focus on the convergence analysis, has attracted significant attention. In this work, we develop a convergence rate that is adaptive to the smoothness of different target distributions, referred to as instance-dependent bound. Specifically, we establish an iteration complexity of $\min\{d,d^{2/3}L^{1/3},d^{1/3}L\}\varepsilon^{-2/3}$ (up to logarithmic factors), where $d$ denotes the data dimension, and $\varepsilon$ quantifies the output accuracy in terms of total variation (TV) distance. In addition, $L$ represents a relaxed Lipschitz constant, which, in the case of Gaussian mixture models, scales only logarithmically with the number of components, the dimension and iteration number, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a matrix factorization-based approach to recover low-rank {\it asymmetric} matrices from corrupted measurements. We propose an {\it Overparameterized Preconditioned Subgradient Algorithm (OPSA)} and provide, for the first time in the literature, linear convergence rates independent of the rank of the sought asymmetric matrix in the presence of gross corruptions. Our work goes beyond existing results in preconditioned-type approaches addressing their current limitation, i.e., the lack of convergence guarantees in the case of {\it asymmetric matrices of unknown rank}. By applying our approach to (robust) matrix sensing, we highlight its merits when the measurement operator satisfies a mixed-norm restricted isometry property. Lastly, we present extensive numerical experiments that validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for different levels of overparameterization and outlier corruptions.

Abstract: The training methods in AI do involve semantically distinct pairs of samples. However, their role typically is to enhance the between class separability. The actual notion of similarity is normally learned from semantically identical pairs. This paper presents SimLAP: a simple framework for learning visual representation from arbitrary pairs. SimLAP explores the possibility of learning similarity from semantically distinct sample pairs. The approach is motivated by the observation that for any pair of classes there exists a subspace in which semantically distinct samples exhibit similarity. This phenomenon can be exploited for a novel method of learning, which optimises the similarity of an arbitrary pair of samples, while simultaneously learning the enabling subspace. The feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated experimentally and its merits discussed.

Abstract: Point-cloud synthesis, i.e. the generation of novel point clouds from an input distribution, remains a challenging task, for which numerous complex machine-learning models have been devised. We develop a novel method that encodes geometrical-topological characteristics of point clouds using inner products, leading to a highly-efficient point cloud representation with provable expressivity properties. Integrated into deep learning models, our encoding exhibits high quality in typical tasks like reconstruction, generation, and interpolation, with inference times orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation, where the goal is for a robot to perform tasks in any environment given a natural language description. However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems. Our code as well as our experiment and deployment videos are open sourced and can be found on our project website: https://dynamem.github.io/

<title>Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Node-Splitting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06268</link>

arXiv:2411.06268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power system networks are often modeled as homogeneous graphs, which limits the ability of graph neural network (GNN) to capture individual generator features at the same nodes. By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.

<title>SequentialBreak: Large Language Models Can be Fooled by Embedding Jailbreak Prompts into Sequential Prompt Chains</title>

arXiv:2411.06426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the integration of the Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications increases, so does their susceptibility to misuse, raising significant security concerns. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on scenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt iterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential prompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while ignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces SequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We discuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog Completion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within benign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct narrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible enough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to achieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines against both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we highlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance LLM security and prevent potential misuse.

Abstract: Multivariate information theory provides a general and principled framework for understanding how the components of a complex system are connected. Existing analyses are coarse in nature -- built up from characterizations of discrete subsystems -- and can be computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose to study the continuous space of possible descriptions of a composite system as a window into its organizational structure. A description consists of specific information conveyed about each of the components, and the space of possible descriptions is equivalent to the space of lossy compression schemes of the components. We introduce a machine learning framework to optimize descriptions that extremize key information theoretic quantities used to characterize organization, such as total correlation and O-information. Through case studies on spin systems, sudoku boards, and letter sequences from natural language, we identify extremal descriptions that reveal how system-wide variation emerges from individual components. By integrating machine learning into a fine-grained information theoretic analysis of composite random variables, our framework opens a new avenues for probing the structure of real-world complex systems.

Abstract: Clean water and sanitation are essential for health, well-being, and sustainable development, yet significant global disparities persist. Although the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 clearly defines targets for universal access to clean water and sanitation, limitations in data coverage and openness impede accurate tracking of progress in many countries. To bridge these gaps, this study integrates Afrobarometer survey data, satellite imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, and advanced deep learning techniques using Meta's self-supervised Distillation with No Labels (DINO) model to develop a modeling framework for evaluating access to piped water and sewage system across diverse African regions. The modeling framework achieved notable accuracy, with over 96% for piped water and 97% for sewage system access classification. When combined with geospatial population data, validation against official statistics from the United Nations Joint Monitoring Program demonstrated high concordance at the national scale (R2 of 0.95 for piped water access and R2 of 0.85 for sewage system access). The national-level estimates can represent SDG Indicators 6.1.1 and 6.2.1. This approach provides policymakers and stakeholders with an effective, scalable, and cost-efficient tool to pinpoint underserved areas requiring targeted intervention. The methodology developed herein can be adapted for assessing other infrastructure-related SDGs, promoting enhanced monitoring and informed decision-making towards achieving global sustainability objectives.

Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.

<title>Circumventing shortcuts in audio-visual deepfake detection datasets with unsupervised learning</title>

arXiv:2412.00175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.

<title>AntiLeakBench: Preventing Data Contamination by Automatically Constructing Benchmarks with Updated Real-World Knowledge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2412.13670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data contamination hinders fair LLM evaluation by introducing test data into newer models' training sets. Existing studies solve this challenge by updating benchmarks with newly collected data. However, they fail to guarantee contamination-free evaluation as the newly collected data may contain pre-existing knowledge, and their benchmark updates rely on intensive human labor. To address these issues, we in this paper propose AntiLeak-Bench, an automated anti-leakage benchmarking framework. Instead of simply using newly collected data, we construct samples with explicitly new knowledge absent from LLMs' training sets, which thus ensures strictly contamination-free evaluation. We further design a fully automated workflow to build and update our benchmark without human labor. This significantly reduces the cost of benchmark maintenance to accommodate emerging LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we highlight that data contamination likely exists before LLMs' cutoff time and demonstrate AntiLeak-Bench effectively overcomes this challenge.

Abstract: Despite the impressive advances achieved using deep learning for functional brain activity analysis, the heterogeneity of functional patterns and the scarcity of imaging data still pose challenges in tasks such as identifying neurological disorders. For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while data may be abundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often scarce, especially for rare diseases, limiting the ability of models to identify clinically-relevant features. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel representation learning strategy integrating meta-learning with self-supervised learning to improve the generalization from normal to clinical features. This approach enables generalization to challenging clinical tasks featuring scarce training data. We achieve this by leveraging self-supervised learning on the control dataset to focus on inherent features that are not limited to a particular supervised task and incorporating meta-learning to improve the generalization across domains. To explore the generalizability of the learned representations to unseen clinical applications, we apply the model to four distinct clinical datasets featuring scarce and heterogeneous data for neurological disorder classification. Results demonstrate the superiority of our representation learning strategy on diverse clinically-relevant tasks. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/wenhui0206/MeTSK/tree/main

<title>Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises: Optimal Convergence without Gradient Clipping</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19529</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2412.19529v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered to have only a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.

Abstract: Objective: To propose and validate an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method that does not require fully sampled k-space data. Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.

arXiv:2501.05874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy for improving the factual accuracy of models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into the generation process. However, existing approaches primarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While very recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos into textual descriptions losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and the seamless integration of retrieved videos jointly with queries for response generation. Also, inspired by that the context size of LVLMs may not be sufficient to process all frames in extremely long videos and not all frames are equally important, we introduce a video frame selection mechanism to extract the most informative subset of frames, along with a strategy to extract textual information from videos (as it can aid the understanding of video content) when their subtitles are not available. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/starsuzi/VideoRAG.

Abstract: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor Product Attention Transformer,(T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines, including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at the decoding stage enable processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models. The code is available at https://github.com/tensorgi/T6.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, are commonly used to adapt LLMs. However, the effectiveness of standard PEFT methods is limited in low-resource scenarios with only a few hundred examples. Recent advances in interpretability research have inspired the emergence of activation editing (or steering) techniques, which modify the activations of specific model components. Due to their extremely small parameter counts, these methods show promise for small datasets. However, their performance is highly dependent on identifying the correct modules to edit and often lacks stability across different datasets. In this paper, we propose Joint Localization and Activation Editing (JoLA), a method that jointly learns (1) which heads in the Transformer to edit (2) whether the intervention should be additive, multiplicative, or both and (3) the intervention parameters themselves - the vectors applied as additive offsets or multiplicative scalings to the head output. Through evaluations on three benchmarks spanning commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding, and natural language generation, we demonstrate that JoLA consistently outperforms existing methods. The code for the method is released at https://github.com/wenlai-lavine/jola.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) collaborative decoding techniques improve output quality by combining the outputs of multiple models at each generation step, but they incur high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative decoding via Speculation (CoS), a novel framework that accelerates collaborative decoding without compromising performance. Inspired by Speculative Decoding--where a small proposal model generates tokens sequentially, and a larger target model verifies them in parallel, our approach builds on two key insights: (1) the verification distribution can be the combined distribution of both the proposal and target models, and (2) alternating each model as the proposer and verifier can further enhance efficiency. We generalize this method to collaboration among n models and theoretically prove that CoS is never slower than standard collaborative decoding, typically achieving faster speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoS is 1.11x-2.23x faster than standard collaborative decoding without compromising generation quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/CoS/.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) encounter significant energy, control and navigation challenges in complex underwater environments, particularly during close-proximity operations, such as launch and recovery (LAR), where fluid interactions and wake effects present additional navigational and energy challenges. Traditional path planning methods fail to incorporate these detailed wake structures, resulting in increased energy consumption, reduced control stability, and heightened safety risks. This paper presents a novel wake-informed, 3D path planning approach that fully integrates localized wake effects and global currents into the planning algorithm. Two variants of the A* algorithm - a current-informed planner and a wake-informed planner - are created to assess its validity and two neural network models are then trained to approximate these planners for real-time applications. Both the A* planners and NN models are evaluated using important metrics such as energy expenditure, path length, and encounters with high-velocity and turbulent regions. The results demonstrate a wake-informed A* planner consistently achieves the lowest energy expenditure and minimizes encounters with high-velocity regions, reducing energy consumption by up to 11.3%. The neural network models are observed to offer computational speedup of 6 orders of magnitude, but exhibit 4.51 - 19.79% higher energy expenditures and 9.81 - 24.38% less optimal paths. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed wake structures into traditional path planning algorithms and the benefits of neural network approximations to enhance energy efficiency and operational safety for AUVs in complex 3D domains.

Abstract: Existing methods fail to effectively steer Large Language Models (LLMs) between textual reasoning and code generation, leaving symbolic computing capabilities underutilized. We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct a comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-turn guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama-3-8B model with a newly designed multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks. Models, Datasets, and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0 and https://huggingface.co/yongchao98.

Abstract: Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.

arXiv:2502.06044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much work on scaling Bayesian Optimization to high-dimensional problems, for example hyperparameter tuning in large machine learning models. These scalable methods have been successful, finding high objective values much more quickly than traditional global Bayesian Optimization or random search-based methods. At the same time, these large models often use sensitive data, but preservation of Differential Privacy has not scaled alongside these modern Bayesian Optimization procedures. Here we develop a method to privately optimize potentially high-dimensional parameter spaces using privatized Gradient Informative Bayesian Optimization. Our theoretical results show that under suitable conditions, our method converges exponentially fast to a locally optimal parameter configuration, up to a natural privacy error. Moreover, regardless of whether the assumptions are satisfied, we prove that our algorithm maintains privacy and empirically display superior performance to existing methods in the high-dimensional hyperparameter setting.

Abstract: Multiple agents -- including humans and AI models -- are increasingly combined to make decisions with the expectation of achieving complementary performance, where the decisions they make together outperform those made individually. However, knowing how to improve the performance of collaborating agents is often difficult without knowing more about what particular information and strategies each agent employs. With a focus on human-AI pairings, we contribute a decision-theoretic framework for characterizing the value of information -- and consequently, opportunities for agents to better exploit available information -- in AI-assisted decision workflows. We present a novel explanation technique (ILIV-SHAP) that adapts SHAP explanations to highlight human-complementing information. We validate the effectiveness of the framework and ILIV-SHAP through a study of human-AI decision-making. We show that our measure of complementary information can be used to identify which AI model will best complement human decisions. We also find that presenting ILIV-SHAP with AI predictions leads to reliably greater reductions in error over non-AI assisted decisions more than vanilla SHAP.

<title>From Individual Experience to Collective Evidence: A Reporting-Based Framework for Identifying Systemic Harms</title>

arXiv:2502.08166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When an individual reports a negative interaction with some system, how can their personal experience be contextualized within broader patterns of system behavior? We study the reporting database problem, where individual reports of adverse events arrive sequentially, and are aggregated over time. In this work, our goal is to identify whether there are subgroups--defined by any combination of relevant features--that are disproportionately likely to experience harmful interactions with the system. We formalize this problem as a sequential hypothesis test, and identify conditions on reporting behavior that are sufficient for making inferences about disparities in true rates of harm across subgroups. We show that algorithms for sequential hypothesis tests can be applied to this problem with a standard multiple testing correction. We then demonstrate our method on real-world datasets, including mortgage decisions and vaccine side effects; on each, our method (re-)identifies subgroups known to experience disproportionate harm using only a fraction of the data that was initially used to discover them.

Abstract: The global mental health crisis is a pressing concern, with college students particularly vulnerable to rising mental health disorders. The widespread use of smartphones among young adults, while offering numerous benefits, has also been linked to negative outcomes such as addiction and regret, significantly impacting well-being. Leveraging the longest longitudinal dataset collected over four college years through passive mobile sensing, this study is the first to examine the relationship between students' smartphone unlocking behaviors and their mental health at scale in real-world settings. We provide the first evidence demonstrating the predictability of phone unlocking behaviors for mental health outcomes based on a large dataset, highlighting the potential of these novel features for future predictive models. Our findings reveal important variations in smartphone usage across genders and locations, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between digital behaviors and mental health. We highlight future research directions aimed at mitigating adverse effects and promoting digital well-being in this population.

Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research. Project page: https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/CellFlux/.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.07148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that tightly couples a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address long-horizon decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner assembles an interpretable sequence of operators that guarantees logical coherence with task constraints, while at the low level each operator is rendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate fine-grained actions directly from raw observations. This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely symbolic, purely neural and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.

arXiv:2503.08250v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Some approaches address this issue by fine-tuning models in terms of preference optimization, etc., which require tailored datasets. Orthogonal to these methods, we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages existing dataset as both positive and negative pairs. To enable efficient alignment with pretrained models, we propose SoftREPA- a lightweight contrastive fine-tuning strategy that leverages soft text tokens for representation alignment. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.

Abstract: Cascade Ranking is a prevalent architecture in large-scale top-k selection systems like recommendation and advertising platforms. Traditional training methods focus on single-stage optimization, neglecting interactions between stages. Recent advances have introduced interaction-aware training paradigms, but still struggle to 1) align training objectives with the goal of the entire cascade ranking (i.e., end-to-end recall of ground-truth items) and 2) learn effective collaboration patterns for different stages. To address these challenges, we propose LCRON, which introduces a novel surrogate loss function derived from the lower bound probability that ground truth items are selected by cascade ranking, ensuring alignment with the overall objective of the system. According to the properties of the derived bound, we further design an auxiliary loss for each stage to drive the reduction of this bound, leading to a more robust and effective top-k selection. LCRON enables end-to-end training of the entire cascade ranking system as a unified network. Experimental results demonstrate that LCRON achieves significant improvement over existing methods on public benchmarks and industrial applications, addressing key limitations in cascade ranking training and significantly enhancing system performance.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is widely used to improve a pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) by training it on curated task-specific datasets, enabling better comprehension of human instructions. However, it is infeasible to collect all possible instruction datasets simultaneously in real-world scenarios. Thus, enabling MLLM with continual instruction tuning is essential for maintaining their adaptability. However, existing methods often trade off memory efficiency for performance gains, significantly compromising overall efficiency. In this paper, we propose a task-specific expansion and task-general fusion framework based on the variations in Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity across different model layers when trained on diverse datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the information leakage present in the existing benchmark and propose a new and more challenging benchmark to rationally evaluate the performance of different methods. Comprehensive experiments showcase a significant performance improvement of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset are released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/HiDe-LLaVA.

Abstract: The future work section of a scientific article outlines potential research directions by identifying gaps and limitations of a current study. This section serves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored areas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations. In this study, we generate future work suggestions from key sections of a scientific article alongside related papers and analyze how the trends have evolved. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation process. We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation. Our results demonstrated that the RAG-based approach with LLM feedback outperforms other methods evaluated through qualitative and quantitative metrics. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the LLM as an extractor and judge. The code and dataset for this project are here, code: HuggingFace

Abstract: Temporal information extraction from unstructured text is essential for contextualizing events and deriving actionable insights, particularly in the medical domain. We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities. Our method improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval $F_1$ score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge. We further demonstrate generalizability by establishing a strong baseline on the E3C corpus. This work not only advances temporal information extraction but also lays the groundwork for improved diagnostic and prognostic models through enhanced temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Automated frame analysis of political communication is a popular task in computational social science that is used to study how authors select aspects of a topic to frame its reception. So far, such studies have been narrow, in that they use a fixed set of pre-defined frames and focus only on the text, ignoring the visual contexts in which those texts appear. Especially for framing in the news, this leaves out valuable information about editorial choices, which include not just the written article but also accompanying photographs. To overcome such limitations, we present a method for conducting multi-modal, multi-label framing analysis at scale using large (vision-) language models. Grounding our work in framing theory, we extract latent meaning embedded in images used to convey a certain point and contrast that to the text by comparing the respective frames used. We also identify highly partisan framing of topics with issue-specific frame analysis found in prior qualitative work. We demonstrate a method for doing scalable integrative framing analysis of both text and image in news, providing a more complete picture for understanding media bias.

Abstract: The platonic representation hypothesis suggests that vision and language embeddings become more homogeneous as model and dataset sizes increase. In particular, pairwise distances within each modality become more similar. This suggests that as foundation models mature, it may become possible to match vision and language embeddings in a fully unsupervised fashion, i.e. without parallel data. We present the first feasibility study, and investigate conformity of existing vision and language foundation models in the context of unsupervised, or "blind", matching. First, we formulate unsupervised matching as a quadratic assignment problem and introduce a novel heuristic that outperforms previous solvers. We also develop a technique to find optimal matching problems, for which a non-trivial match is very likely. Second, we conduct an extensive study deploying a range of vision and language models on four datasets. Our analysis reveals that for many problem instances, vision and language representations can be indeed matched without supervision. This finding opens up the exciting possibility of embedding semantic knowledge into other modalities virtually annotation-free. As a proof of concept, we showcase an unsupervised classifier, which achieves non-trivial classification accuracy without any image-text annotation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowSelf.

arXiv:2505.03475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arena-based evaluation is a fundamental yet significant evaluation paradigm for modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.

Abstract: E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. Project page: https://lexam-benchmark.github.io/

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs (KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7% in MRR.

arXiv:2505.16223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models.

<title>Understanding and Mitigating Overrefusal in LLMs from an Unveiling Perspective of Safety Decision Boundary</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages. Code and datasets will be released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RASS-80D3.

Abstract: DONNs leverage light propagation for efficient analog AI and signal processing. Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop optimizes implementable metasurfaces via adjoint methods, but is computationally prohibitive and unscalable. To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely explored for automated scoring in low-stakes assessment to facilitate learning and instruction. Empirical evidence related to which LLM produces the most reliable scores and induces least rater effects needs to be collected before the use of LLMs for automated scoring in practice. This study compared ten LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, OpenAI o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0, as well as DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek R1) with human expert raters in scoring two types of writing tasks. The accuracy of the holistic and analytic scores from LLMs compared with human raters was evaluated in terms of Quadratic Weighted Kappa. Intra-rater consistency across prompts was compared in terms of Cronbach Alpha. Rater effects of LLMs were evaluated and compared with human raters using the Many-Facet Rasch model. The results in general supported the use of ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with high scoring accuracy, better rater reliability, and less rater effects.

Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.3 billion items.

Abstract: Recognizing complex emotions linked to ambivalence and hesitancy (A/H) can play a critical role in the personalization and effectiveness of digital behaviour change interventions. These subtle and conflicting emotions are manifested by a discord between multiple modalities, such as facial and vocal expressions, and body language. Although experts can be trained to identify A/H, integrating them into digital interventions is costly and less effective. Automatic learning systems provide a cost-effective alternative that can adapt to individual users, and operate seamlessly within real-time, and resource-limited environments. However, there are currently no datasets available for the design of ML models to recognize A/H. This paper introduces a first Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset collected for subject-based multimodal recognition of A/H in videos. It contains videos from 224 participants captured across 9 provinces in Canada, with different age, and ethnicity. Through our web platform, we recruited participants to answer 7 questions, some of which were designed to elicit A/H while recording themselves via webcam with microphone. BAH amounts to 1,118 videos for a total duration of 8.26 hours with 1.5 hours of A/H. Our behavioural team annotated timestamp segments to indicate where A/H occurs, and provide frame- and video-level annotations with the A/H cues. Video transcripts and their timestamps are also included, along with cropped and aligned faces in each frame, and a variety of participants meta-data. We include results baselines for BAH at frame- and video-level recognition in multi-modal setups, in addition to zero-shot prediction, and for personalization using unsupervised domain adaptation. The limited performance of baseline models highlights the challenges of recognizing A/H in real-world videos. The data, code, and pretrained weights are available.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches. Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.

The article introduces VTool-R1, a framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating visual reasoning steps. By interleaving text and visual steps during training, VTool-R1 enables LLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought.

The framework is trained using outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, enabling LLMs to "think with images" and improve reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.
  We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.

Summary:<br /><br />Agricultural decision-making is a complex process that relies on various factors such as geography, climate, and economics. Traditional large language models struggle to navigate this complexity, leading researchers to explore the use of large reasoning models. The AgReason project introduces an expert-curated benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning, showing that large reasoning models outperform conventional ones. The AgThoughts dataset, with 44.6K question-answer pairs, is presented to improve agricultural reasoning abilities in language models.

Abstract: Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning, where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning. Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces. Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is here: https://baskargroup.github.io/Ag_reasoning/

<div> Keywords: model-based reinforcement learning, diffusion world models, Atari100k benchmark, Joint Embedding Diffusion, human-level performance

Summary:
Recent advancements in model-based reinforcement learning have led to super-human performance on the Atari100k benchmark. However, there exists a performance asymmetry where MBRL agents excel in some tasks but underperform in others, skewing aggregate metrics. Pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models exhibit this asymmetry more prominently. To address this issue, tasks are categorized as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal, highlighting the need for balanced metrics. The lack of temporally-structured latent space in pixel-based methods is identified as a contributor to the asymmetry. A new model, Joint Embedding Diffusion (JEDI), is proposed to tackle this problem. JEDI outperforms current models in human-optimal tasks, remains competitive in the Atari100k benchmark, and boasts improved efficiency in terms of speed and memory usage. This work challenges the traditional definition of crossing human-level performance in the Atari100k domain.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models. However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.

Summary:
Replay-based continual learning methods often struggle with consolidating past knowledge due to limited memory buffer capacity and heuristic data selection. To address this challenge, a new dataset distillation framework for continual learning is proposed in this study. The framework employs a learnable memory buffer to distill global information from current task data and accumulated knowledge from the previous memory buffer. A lightweight distillation module is introduced to generate soft labels for memory buffer data, minimizing computational overhead and overfitting risks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance and effectively prevents forgetting across various datasets. The source code for the method will be made publicly available. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Replay-based continual learning (CL) methods assume that models trained on a small subset can also effectively minimize the empirical risk of the complete dataset. These methods maintain a memory buffer that stores a sampled subset of data from previous tasks to consolidate past knowledge. However, this assumption is not guaranteed in practice due to the limited capacity of the memory buffer and the heuristic criteria used for buffer data selection. To address this issue, we propose a new dataset distillation framework tailored for CL, which maintains a learnable memory buffer to distill the global information from the current task data and accumulated knowledge preserved in the previous memory buffer. Moreover, to avoid the computational overhead and overfitting risks associated with parameterizing the entire buffer during distillation, we introduce a lightweight distillation module that can achieve global information distillation solely by generating learnable soft labels for the memory buffer data. Extensive experiments show that, our method can achieve competitive results and effectively mitigates forgetting across various datasets. The source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce the Robust Audio Watermarking Benchmark (RAW-Bench), a benchmark for evaluating deep learning-based audio watermarking methods with standardized and systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline with various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, along with a diverse test dataset including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. Evaluating four existing watermarking methods on RAW-bench reveals two main insights: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain methods.

The study explores the interaction between users and knowledge graphs (KGs) using large language models (LLMs) for exploration. The LinkQ system was developed to convert natural language questions into structured queries with LLMs. Visual mechanisms were designed to help users assess the accuracy of KG queries and LLM responses. Findings from a qualitative evaluation with practitioners revealed that users tended to overtrust the system's outputs, even when incorrect, due to the helpful visualizations. Users showed distinct workflows based on their familiarity with KGs and LLMs, challenging the assumption of one-size-fits-all systems. The study highlights the risks of false trust in LLM-assisted tools and emphasizes the need for further research on visualization as a mitigation strategy. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful data structures, but exploring them effectively remains difficult for even expert users. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to address this gap, yet little is known empirically about how their usage with KGs shapes user trust, exploration strategies, or downstream decision-making - raising key design challenges for LLM-based KG visual analysis systems. To study these effects, we developed LinkQ, a KG exploration system that converts natural language questions into structured queries with an LLM. We collaborated with KG experts to design five visual mechanisms that help users assess the accuracy of both KG queries and LLM responses: an LLM-KG state diagram that illustrates which stage of the exploration pipeline LinkQ is in, a query editor displaying the generated query paired with an LLM explanation, an entity-relation ID table showing extracted KG entities and relations with semantic descriptions, a query structure graph that depicts the path traversed in the KG, and an interactive graph visualization of query results. From a qualitative evaluation with 14 practitioners, we found that users - even KG experts - tended to overtrust LinkQ's outputs due to its "helpful" visualizations, even when the LLM was incorrect. Users exhibited distinct workflows depending on their prior familiarity with KGs and LLMs, challenging the assumption that these systems are one-size-fits-all - despite often being designed as if they are. Our findings highlight the risks of false trust in LLM-assisted data analysis tools and the need for further investigation into the role of visualization as a mitigation technique.

Abstract: We introduce SIMCOPILOT, a benchmark that simulates the role of large language models (LLMs) as interactive, "copilot"-style coding assistants. Targeting both completion (finishing incomplete methods or code blocks) and infill tasks (filling missing segments within existing code), SIMCOPILOT provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM coding capabilities. The benchmark comprises dedicated sub-benchmarks for Java (SIMCOPILOTJ) and Python (SIMCOPILOTP), covering diverse codebases varying in size and complexity. Our key contributions include: (a) establishing a realistic, detailed evaluation environment to assess LLM utility in practical coding scenarios, and (b) providing fine-grained analyses that address critical factors frequently overlooked by existing benchmarks, such as task-specific performance nuances, contextual understanding across code segments, and sensitivity to variable scope. Evaluations conducted across domains-including algorithms, databases, computer vision, and neural networks-offer insights into model strengths and highlight persistent challenges in maintaining logical consistency within complex dependency structures. Beyond benchmarking, our study sheds light on the current limitations of LLM-driven code generation and underscores the ongoing transition of LLMs from merely syntax-aware generators toward reliable, intelligent software development partners.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) method called Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE) designed specifically for multivariate time series (MTS) data. Traditional SFDA methods struggle with MTS due to a lack of consideration for spatial correlations inherent in the data. TERSE addresses this challenge by utilizing a customized spatial-temporal feature encoder and tasks for temporal restoration and spatial rewiring to capture and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across domains. By guiding the target encoder to produce consistent features with the source domain, TERSE facilitates implicit feature alignment. It can also be easily integrated into existing SFDA methods as a plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments on real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of TERSE in preserving data privacy and accurately adapting pre-trained models to unlabelled target domains. <div>

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model from an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain without accessing the source data, thereby preserving data privacy. While existing SFDA methods have proven effective in reducing reliance on source data, they struggle to perform well on multivariate time series (MTS) due to their failure to consider the intrinsic spatial correlations inherent in MTS data. These spatial correlations are crucial for accurately representing MTS data and preserving invariant information across domains. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal Restoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method tailored for MTS data. Specifically, TERSE comprises a customized spatial-temporal feature encoder designed to capture the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics, coupled with both temporal restoration and spatial rewiring tasks to reinstate latent representations of the temporally masked time series and the spatially masked correlated structures. During the target adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and temporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source pre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore, TERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across domains, facilitating implicit feature alignment. In addition, as the first approach to simultaneously consider spatial-temporal consistency in MTS-SFDA, TERSE can also be integrated as a versatile plug-and-play module into established SFDA methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking), a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools. Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research.

<div> Keywords: wireless communications, deep learning, Automatic Modulation Recognition, model pruning, channel-level pruning

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces FCOS, a novel Fine-to-Coarse two-Stage pruning framework for Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) in wireless communications. FCOS combines channel-level pruning with layer-level collapse diagnosis to achieve extreme compression and high performance while maintaining accuracy. In the first stage, hierarchical clustering and parameter fusion are used for channel-level pruning, followed by a Layer Collapse Diagnosis (LaCD) module to identify and remove collapsed layers. Experimental results show that FCOS outperforms existing methods, achieving a 95.51% reduction in FLOPs and 95.31% reduction in parameters while only experiencing a 0.46% drop in accuracy on Sig2019-12 benchmark. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration.  <div>

Abstract: With the rapid development of wireless communications and the growing complexity of digital modulation schemes, traditional manual modulation recognition methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet real-time requirements in modern scenarios. Recently, deep learning based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) approaches have greatly improved classification accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Model pruning provides a general approach to reduce model complexity, but existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques each present a trade-off between compression rate, hardware acceleration, and accuracy preservation. To this end, in this paper, we introduce FCOS, a novel Fine-to-COarse two-Stage pruning framework that combines channel-level pruning with layer-level collapse diagnosis to achieve extreme compression, high performance and efficient inference. In the first stage of FCOS, hierarchical clustering and parameter fusion are applied to channel weights to achieve channel-level pruning. Then a Layer Collapse Diagnosis (LaCD) module uses linear probing to identify layer collapse and removes the collapsed layers due to high channel compression ratio. Experiments on multiple AMR benchmarks demonstrate that FCOS outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, FCOS achieves 95.51% FLOPs reduction and 95.31% parameter reduction while still maintaining performance close to the original ResNet56, with only a 0.46% drop in accuracy on Sig2019-12.

Summary: 
The Spectral-inspired Neural Operator (SINO) framework is introduced for learning PDE operators from limited trajectories without known PDE terms. SINO operates in the frequency domain and utilizes a Frequency-to-Vector module for spectral representations. It incorporates a nonlinear operator block with a $\Pi$-Block for modeling nonlinear interactions and introduces operator distillation for efficient inference. SINO outperforms existing methods in PDE benchmarks, showing strong discretization invariance and generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions. Notably, SINO can accurately simulate globally coupled systems, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, with limited data and no explicit PDE terms present. <div>
arXiv:2505.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern the spatiotemporal evolution of various physical systems. Classical numerical solvers, while accurate, require fine discretization and full knowledge of the governing PDEs, limiting their applicability when the physics is unknown or fast inference is required. Data-driven neural PDE solvers alleviate these constraints by learning from data but demand large training datasets and perform poorly in data-scarce regimes. Physics-aware methods mitigate data requirements by incorporating physical knowledge yet rely on known PDE terms or local numerical schemes, restricting their ability to handle unknown or globally coupled systems. In this work, we propose the Spectral-inspired Neural Operator (SINO), a novel framework that learns PDE operators from limited trajectories (as few as 2-5), without any known PDE terms. SINO operates in the frequency domain and introduces a Frequency-to-Vector module to learn spectral representations analogous to derivative multipliers. To model nonlinear physical interactions, we design a nonlinear operator block that includes a $\Pi$-Block with low-pass filtering to prevent aliasing. Finally, we introduce an operator distillation technique to distill the trained model for efficient inference. SINO achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple PDE benchmarks, demonstrating strong discretization invariance and robust generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions. To our knowledge, SINO is the first physics-aware method capable of accurately simulating globally coupled systems (e.g., the Navier-Stokes equations) from limited data without any explicit PDE terms.

<div> Keywords: Label distribution learning, background concentration, concentration distribution learning, probabilistic methods, neural networks

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces a new concept called background concentration to enhance label distribution learning (LDL) by incorporating the absolute intensity of each label. By considering the total description degree of hidden labels not in the label space, the proposed concentration distribution learning improves the representation of instances and minimizes information loss. A novel model combining probabilistic methods and neural networks is developed to learn both label distributions and background concentrations from existing LDL datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach effectively extracts background concentrations and yields more accurate prediction results compared to existing LDL methods. The code for the proposed method is publicly available on GitHub for further research and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2505.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an effective method to predict the relative label description degree (a.k.a. label distribution) of a sample. However, the label distribution is not a complete representation of an instance because it overlooks the absolute intensity of each label. Specifically, it's impossible to obtain the total description degree of hidden labels that not in the label space, which leads to the loss of information and confusion in instances. To solve the above problem, we come up with a new concept named background concentration to serve as the absolute description degree term of the label distribution and introduce it into the LDL process, forming the improved paradigm of concentration distribution learning. Moreover, we propose a novel model by probabilistic methods and neural networks to learn label distributions and background concentrations from existing LDL datasets. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed approach is able to extract background concentrations from label distributions while producing more accurate prediction results than the state-of-the-art LDL methods.

<div> Keywords: fairness, federated learning, sociotechnical contexts, harms, stakeholders 

Summary: 
This paper discusses the limitations of current approaches to fairness in federated learning, highlighting five key pitfalls. Firstly, fairness is often defined solely through the server-client architecture perspective. Secondly, there is a mismatch between simulated scenarios and real-world contexts. Thirdly, definitions often prioritize protecting the system over protecting its users. Fourthly, interventions target specific stages of the lifecycle, neglecting broader impacts. Lastly, there is a lack of alignment among multiple stakeholders with different fairness definitions. The paper proposes a harm-centered framework to address these issues, connecting fairness definitions to concrete risks and stakeholder vulnerabilities. Recommendations are made for more holistic, context-aware, and accountable fairness research in federated learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in federated learning has emerged as a rapidly growing area of research, with numerous works proposing formal definitions and algorithmic interventions. Yet, despite this technical progress, fairness in FL is often defined and evaluated in ways that abstract away from the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems are deployed. In this paper, we argue that existing approaches tend to optimize narrow system level metrics, such as performance parity or contribution-based rewards, while overlooking how harms arise throughout the FL lifecycle and how they impact diverse stakeholders. We support this claim through a critical analysis of the literature, based on a systematic annotation of papers for their fairness definitions, design decisions, evaluation practices, and motivating use cases. Our analysis reveals five recurring pitfalls: 1) fairness framed solely through the lens of server client architecture, 2) a mismatch between simulations and motivating use-cases and contexts, 3) definitions that conflate protecting the system with protecting its users, 4) interventions that target isolated stages of the lifecycle while neglecting upstream and downstream effects, 5) and a lack of multi-stakeholder alignment where multiple fairness definitions can be relevant at once. Building on these insights, we propose a harm centered framework that links fairness definitions to concrete risks and stakeholder vulnerabilities. We conclude with recommendations for more holistic, context-aware, and accountable fairness research in FL.

<br />
Summary: 
Cellular Complex Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Trimming (CellCLAT) is a novel framework for self-supervised topological deep learning on cellular complexes. It addresses challenges such as extrinsic structural constraints and intrinsic semantic redundancy in cellular representations. CellCLAT utilizes parameter perturbation-based augmentation to preserve cellular topology during contrastive learning while masking task-irrelevant cells through a cellular trimming scheduler. This approach enhances the representation of unlabeled graphs by capturing higher-order interactions in cellular complexes more effectively. The framework demonstrates significant improvements over existing self-supervised graph learning methods, making a valuable contribution to the field of topological deep learning. <div>
arXiv:2505.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised topological deep learning (TDL) represents a nascent but underexplored area with significant potential for modeling higher-order interactions in simplicial complexes and cellular complexes to derive representations of unlabeled graphs. Compared to simplicial complexes, cellular complexes exhibit greater expressive power. However, the advancement in self-supervised learning for cellular TDL is largely hindered by two core challenges: \textit{extrinsic structural constraints} inherent to cellular complexes, and intrinsic semantic redundancy in cellular representations. The first challenge highlights that traditional graph augmentation techniques may compromise the integrity of higher-order cellular interactions, while the second underscores that topological redundancy in cellular complexes potentially diminish task-relevant information. To address these issues, we introduce Cellular Complex Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Trimming (CellCLAT), a twofold framework designed to adhere to the combinatorial constraints of cellular complexes while mitigating informational redundancy. Specifically, we propose a parameter perturbation-based augmentation method that injects controlled noise into cellular interactions without altering the underlying cellular structures, thereby preserving cellular topology during contrastive learning. Additionally, a cellular trimming scheduler is employed to mask gradient contributions from task-irrelevant cells through a bi-level meta-learning approach, effectively removing redundant topological elements while maintaining critical higher-order semantics. We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation to demonstrate that CellCLAT achieves substantial improvements over existing self-supervised graph learning methods, marking a significant attempt in this domain.

<div> Keywords: model quantization, diffusion models, floating-point quantization, fine-tuning, denoising

Summary:
Model quantization aims to reduce the bit-width of weights and activations in diffusion models for improved memory efficiency and faster inference speed. However, achieving 4-bit quantization has been challenging. Existing methods based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning have shown inconsistent performance. This study explores low-bit floating-point (FP) quantization for diffusion models and identifies key challenges such as handling asymmetric activation distributions and considering temporal complexity during the denoising process. To address these challenges, the mixup-sign floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework is proposed, which introduces unsigned FP quantization and incorporates timestep-aware techniques and denoising-factor loss alignment for precise and stable fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models compared to existing methods in 4-bit integer quantization.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces the bit-width of weights and activations, improving memory efficiency and inference speed in diffusion models. However, achieving 4-bit quantization remains challenging. Existing methods, primarily based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning, struggle with inconsistent performance. Inspired by the success of floating-point (FP) quantization in large language models, we explore low-bit FP quantization for diffusion models and identify key challenges: the failure of signed FP quantization to handle asymmetric activation distributions, the insufficient consideration of temporal complexity in the denoising process during fine-tuning, and the misalignment between fine-tuning loss and quantization error. To address these challenges, we propose the mixup-sign floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework, first introducing unsigned FP quantization in model quantization, along with timestep-aware LoRA (TALoRA) and denoising-factor loss alignment (DFA), which ensure precise and stable fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that we are the first to achieve superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models, outperforming existing PTQ fine-tuning methods in 4-bit INT quantization.

<div> Keywords: overfitting, machine learning, data augmentation, occlusion, generalization 

Summary: 
The article addresses the issue of overfitting in machine learning models, proposing a novel data augmentation technique called Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop). Unlike existing methods that randomly mask input features, RelDrop selectively occludes the most relevant regions of the input to encourage the model to utilize other important features during training. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study demonstrates that RelDrop improves model robustness towards occlusion, encourages the use of more features within the region of interest, and enhances generalization performance at inference time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and reducing the train-test performance gap. The code implementation for RelDrop is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overfitting is a well-known issue extending even to state-of-the-art (SOTA) Machine Learning (ML) models, resulting in reduced generalization, and a significant train-test performance gap. Mitigation measures include a combination of dropout, data augmentation, weight decay, and other regularization techniques. Among the various data augmentation strategies, occlusion is a prominent technique that typically focuses on randomly masking regions of the input during training. Most of the existing literature emphasizes randomness in selecting and modifying the input features instead of regions that strongly influence model decisions. We propose Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop), a novel data augmentation method which selectively occludes the most relevant regions of the input, nudging the model to use other important features in the prediction process, thus improving model generalization through informed regularization. We further conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to study how Relevance-driven Input Dropout (RelDrop) affects model decision-making. Through a series of experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness towards occlusion, results in models utilizing more features within the region of interest, and boosts inference time generalization performance.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, safety benchmark, hazardous scenarios, SOSBench, model alignment deficiencies

Summary:
The article introduces SOSBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the safety and resilience of large language models (LLMs) when handling high-risk scientific scenarios in domains such as chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The benchmark consists of 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws, including detailed and complex misuse scenarios. The evaluation of state-of-the-art models using SOSBench reveals significant deficiencies in model alignment with safety regulations, with high rates of harmful responses detected across all domains. Advanced models like Deepseek-R1 and GPT-4.1 exhibit alarming levels of policy-violating content, raising urgent concerns about the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs. SOSBench highlights the need for improved safety benchmarks and increased attention to the risks associated with the misuse of advanced language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks, such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks, remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g., multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently, they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive, hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded, hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws, systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench. Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1). These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Models trained on one data distribution often experience substantial performance degradation when evaluated on shifted or unseen domains. To address this challenge, the present paper studies the design of training data distributions that maximize average-case OOD performance. First, a theoretical analysis establishes a family of generalization bounds that quantify how the choice of training distribution influences OOD error across a predefined family of target distributions. These insights motivate the introduction of two complementary algorithmic strategies: (i) directly formulating OOD risk minimization as a bilevel optimization problem over the space of probability measures and (ii) minimizing a theoretical upper bound on OOD error. Last, the paper evaluates the two approaches across a range of function approximation and operator learning examples. The proposed methods significantly improve OOD accuracy over standard empirical risk minimization with a fixed distribution. These results highlight the potential of distribution-aware training as a principled and practical framework for robust OOD generalization.

Summary: 
In this paper, the relationship between inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), inverse optimization (IO) for Markov decision processes (MDPs), and apprenticeship learning (AL) is investigated. The authors incorporate prior beliefs on the cost function structure into IRL and AL, showing that AL can be seen as a relaxation of their framework. By formulating AL as a regularized min-max problem, they address the ill-posedness of IRL using a regularizer to guide the search for plausible cost functions. Stochastic mirror descent (SMD) is employed to solve the resulting regularized-convex-concave-min-max problem, with convergence bounds established. Numerical experiments underscore the importance of regularization in learning cost vectors and apprentice policies. <div>

Abstract: The relationship between inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and inverse optimization (IO) for Markov decision processes (MDPs) has been relatively underexplored in the literature, despite addressing the same problem. In this work, we revisit the relationship between the IO framework for MDPs, IRL, and apprenticeship learning (AL). We incorporate prior beliefs on the structure of the cost function into the IRL and AL problems, and demonstrate that the convex-analytic view of the AL formalism (Kamoutsi et al., 2021) emerges as a relaxation of our framework. Notably, the AL formalism is a special case in our framework when the regularization term is absent. Focusing on the suboptimal expert setting, we formulate the AL problem as a regularized min-max problem. The regularizer plays a key role in addressing the ill-posedness of IRL by guiding the search for plausible cost functions. To solve the resulting regularized-convex-concave-min-max problem, we use stochastic mirror descent (SMD) and establish convergence bounds for the proposed method. Numerical experiments highlight the critical role of regularization in learning cost vectors and apprentice policies.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers introduce a framework for designing efficient diffusion models on symmetric-space Riemannian manifolds like the torus, sphere, special orthogonal group, and unitary group. They develop a new diffusion model with a spatially-varying covariance, allowing them to bypass heat kernel computations by leveraging a projection of Euclidean Brownian motion. The training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived through Ito's Lemma, running in O(1) gradient evaluations and nearly-linear-in-d (O(d^1.19)) arithmetic operations per step. The model's manifold symmetries ensure an "average-case" Lipschitz condition, facilitating accurate and efficient sample generation. Empirical results demonstrate that their model outperforms previous methods in training speed and enhances sample quality on synthetic datasets across various symmetric manifolds. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for designing efficient diffusion models for $d$-dimensional symmetric-space Riemannian manifolds, including the torus, sphere, special orthogonal group and unitary group. Existing manifold diffusion models often depend on heat kernels, which lack closed-form expressions and require either $d$ gradient evaluations or exponential-in-$d$ arithmetic operations per training step. We introduce a new diffusion model for symmetric manifolds with a spatially-varying covariance, allowing us to leverage a projection of Euclidean Brownian motion to bypass heat kernel computations. Our training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived via Ito's Lemma, allowing each step to run in $O(1)$ gradient evaluations and nearly-linear-in-$d$ ($O(d^{1.19})$) arithmetic operations, reducing the gap between diffusions on symmetric manifolds and Euclidean space. Manifold symmetries ensure the diffusion satisfies an "average-case" Lipschitz condition, enabling accurate and efficient sample generation. Empirically, our model outperforms prior methods in training speed and improves sample quality on synthetic datasets on the torus, special orthogonal group, and unitary group.

arXiv:2505.21641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average treatment effect (ATE) is widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs and other medical interventions. In safety-critical applications like medicine, reliable inferences about the ATE typically require valid uncertainty quantification, such as through confidence intervals (CIs). However, estimating treatment effects in these settings often involves sensitive data that must be kept private. In this work, we present PrivATE, a novel machine learning framework for computing CIs for the ATE under differential privacy. Specifically, we focus on deriving valid privacy-preserving CIs for the ATE from observational data. Our PrivATE framework consists of three steps: (i) estimating a differentially private ATE through output perturbation; (ii) estimating the differentially private variance through a truncated output perturbation mechanism; and (iii) constructing the CIs while accounting for the uncertainty from both the estimation and privatization steps. Our PrivATE framework is model agnostic, doubly robust, and ensures valid CIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using synthetic and real-world medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive a general, doubly robust framework for valid CIs of the ATE under ($\varepsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy.

Summary: 
AutoSGD is a novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method that automatically adjusts the learning rate at each iteration, eliminating the need for manual tuning. It determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate based on the current iteration's performance. The method is supported by theoretical convergence guarantees and has a deterministic counterpart for standard gradient descent. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSGD across various optimization problems and machine learning tasks. This approach addresses the challenge of selecting an optimal learning rate schedule and shows promising performance in practice. <div>

Abstract: The learning rate is an important tuning parameter for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and can greatly influence its performance. However, appropriate selection of a learning rate schedule across all iterations typically requires a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort. To address this, we introduce AutoSGD: an SGD method that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate at a given iteration and then takes appropriate action. We introduce theory supporting the convergence of AutoSGD, along with its deterministic counterpart for standard gradient descent. Empirical results suggest strong performance of the method on a variety of traditional optimization problems and machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Visual presentations are vital for effective communication. Early attempts to automate their creation using deep learning often faced issues such as poorly organized layouts, inaccurate text summarization, and a lack of image understanding, leading to mismatched visuals and text. These limitations restrict their application in formal contexts like business and scientific research. To address these challenges, we propose PreGenie, an agentic and modular framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for generating high-quality visual presentations.
  PreGenie is built on the Slidev presentation framework, where slides are rendered from Markdown code. It operates in two stages: (1) Analysis and Initial Generation, which summarizes multimodal input and generates initial code, and (2) Review and Re-generation, which iteratively reviews intermediate code and rendered slides to produce final, high-quality presentations. Each stage leverages multiple MLLMs that collaborate and share information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PreGenie excels in multimodal understanding, outperforming existing models in both aesthetics and content consistency, while aligning more closely with human design preferences.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a method called Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion (SLCD) for the controllable generation of diffusion models. SLCD aims to optimize a KL-regularized objective function by iteratively generating online data and training a small classifier. It does not rely on complex concepts from reinforcement learning or control, making it more resource-efficient. The output from SLCD is proven to converge to the optimal solution of the objective under KL divergence. Empirical results show that SLCD can generate high-quality samples with minimal inference time, comparable to the base model, in tasks such as image generation and biological sequence generation. The code for SLCD is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The controllable generation of diffusion models aims to steer the model to generate samples that optimize some given objective functions. It is desirable for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion, which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base model in both image generation with continuous diffusion and biological sequence generation with discrete diffusion.

Summary:
Data-mediated interactions between generative AI (genAI) models and training data from other models on the internet have potential consequences. This study explores the effects of such interactions, showing that models trained on others' outputs can benefit from exposure to novel concepts but may also result in homogenization of performance on shared tasks. The empirical evidence and theoretical model provided shed light on how these interactions might unfold in practice, highlighting the importance of understanding the downstream effects of data-mediated model interactions in an increasingly genAI-dependent society. <div>
arXiv:2505.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internet is full of AI-generated content while also serving as a common source of training data for generative AI (genAI) models. This duality raises the possibility that future genAI models may be trained on other models' generated outputs. Prior work has studied consequences of models training on their own generated outputs, but limited work has considered what happens if models ingest content produced by other models. Given society's increasing dependence on genAI tools, understanding downstream effects of such data-mediated model interactions is critical. To this end, we provide empirical evidence for how data-mediated interactions might unfold in practice, develop a theoretical model for this interactive training process, and show experimentally possible long-term results of such interactions. We find that data-mediated interactions can benefit models by exposing them to novel concepts perhaps missed in original training data, but also can homogenize their performance on shared tasks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces multivariateGPT, an architecture designed to model sequences of mixed categorical and numeric data. It addresses limitations in existing approaches by incorporating autoregressive sequence decomposition, embedding schemes, and a loss function that enables likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next token class and value. By extending the next token prediction task, multivariateGPT efficiently generalizes patterns in simple physical systems and complex time series like electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data. This advancement allows transformer models to effectively handle a wider range of data types, showcasing their versatility and potential for enhancing data analysis in real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2505.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world processes often generate data that are a mix of categorical and numeric values that are recorded at irregular and informative intervals. Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data. This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes of data.

Summary:
The article introduces an incentive system called Gauntlet for distributed deep learning, implemented on the bittensor blockchain. It allows for the training of a 1.2B LLM model with permissionless contributions of pseudo-gradients from users with varying hardware. Gauntlet can be applied to synchronous distributed training schemes. The system utilizes a two-stage mechanism to filter peer reliability and synchronization, along with a core component for estimating loss before and after contributions. An OpenSkill rating system tracks the competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores. A novel mechanism ensures unique computations by peers. The 1.2B run on the system has paid out real-valued tokens to participants based on their contributions, resulting in a competitive model. <div>

Abstract: We describe an incentive system for distributed deep learning of foundational models where peers are rewarded for contributions. The incentive system, \textit{Gauntlet}, has been deployed on the bittensor blockchain and used to train a 1.2B LLM with completely permissionless contributions of pseudo-gradients: no control over the users that can register or their hardware. \textit{Gauntlet} can be applied to any synchronous distributed training scheme that relies on aggregating updates or pseudo-gradients. We rely on a two-stage mechanism for fast filtering of peer uptime, reliability, and synchronization, combined with the core component that estimates the loss before and after individual pseudo-gradient contributions. We utilized an OpenSkill rating system to track competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores across time. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism to ensure peers on the network perform unique computations. Our live 1.2B run, which has paid out real-valued tokens to participants based on the value of their contributions, yielded a competitive (on a per-iteration basis) 1.2B model that demonstrates the utility of our incentive system.

<br />
Summary: LrcSSM is a nonlinear recurrent model that efficiently processes long sequences with fast parallel computation. By utilizing a diagonal state-transition matrix learned at each step, it achieves $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory complexity and low $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth. The model offers a gradient-stability guarantee and outperforms other input-varying systems on long-range forecasting tasks. With a compute-optimal scaling law regime similar to Mamba, LrcSSM demonstrates superior performance compared to quadratic-attention Transformers while avoiding memory overhead. The forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, making it computationally efficient, and its parameter count scales optimally with depth. Overall, LrcSSM showcases impressive capabilities in processing long sequences and outperforming established models on forecasting tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a \textit{nonlinear} recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

Summary: 
The study investigates the behavior of gradient descent (GD) in deep ReLU networks when initialized with small weights. It focuses on the escape directions, analogous to the eigenvectors of the Hessian for strict saddles, and their importance in navigating the parameter space dominated by saddles. The optimal escape direction is characterized by a low-rank bias in deeper layers, with the first singular value of the weight matrix increasing at least as the square root of the layer depth. The research presents results related to these escape directions and suggests that this finding is a crucial step towards understanding Saddle-to-Saddle dynamics in deep ReLU networks, where GD encounters a sequence of saddles with increasing bottleneck rank. <div>
arXiv:2505.21722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a deep ReLU network is initialized with small weights, GD is at first dominated by the saddle at the origin in parameter space. We study the so-called escape directions, which play a similar role as the eigenvectors of the Hessian for strict saddles. We show that the optimal escape direction features a low-rank bias in its deeper layers: the first singular value of the $\ell$-th layer weight matrix is at least $\ell^{\frac{1}{4}}$ larger than any other singular value. We also prove a number of related results about these escape directions. We argue that this result is a first step in proving Saddle-to-Saddle dynamics in deep ReLU networks, where GD visits a sequence of saddles with increasing bottleneck rank.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieve impressive results in a wide variety of tasks, but they lack zero-shot adaptation capabilities. While most robustness evaluations focus on tasks complexifications, for which human also struggle to maintain performances, no evaluation has been performed on tasks simplifications. To tackle this issue, we introduce HackAtari, a set of task variations of the Arcade Learning Environments. We use it to demonstrate that, contrary to humans, RL agents systematically exhibit huge performance drops on simpler versions of their training tasks, uncovering agents' consistent reliance on shortcuts. Our analysis across multiple algorithms and architectures highlights the persistent gap between RL agents and human behavioral intelligence, underscoring the need for new benchmarks and methodologies that enforce systematic generalization testing beyond static evaluation protocols. Training and testing in the same environment is not enough to obtain agents equipped with human-like intelligence.

Summary: 
The research introduces Latent Crossing (LaX), a module enhancing low-rank models' capacity by enabling information flow across subspaces, overcoming limitations of traditional low-rank factorization methods. LaX significantly improves performance on pre-training tasks with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models, matching or surpassing full-rank baselines while using 2-3 times fewer parameters. When combined with low-rank adapters (LoRA) for fine-tuning larger models like LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently enhances performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks at minimal cost. The research showcases the effectiveness of LaX as a simple yet powerful plug-and-play solution for boosting the performance of low-rank models in various high-computational-cost training scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing (LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with negligible cost.

Summary:<br />
Traffic safety science faces challenges due to limited crash data. To achieve Vision Zero, a paradigm shift towards counterfactual safety learning is needed. This involves considering potential dangerous scenarios that could have occurred. The proposed agenda combines crash-rate priors, generative scene engines, and diverse driver models to synthesize and explain near-miss events. A crash-focused digital twin testbed connects micro scenes to macro patterns, ensuring statistical realism. This transformation of sparse crash data enables proactive prevention of accidents through crash prediction and stress-testing of vehicles, roads, and policies. By learning from almost-crashes, traffic safety can shift from reactive forensics to proactive prevention, ultimately advancing Vision Zero. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic safety science has long been hindered by a fundamental data paradox: the crashes we most wish to prevent are precisely those events we rarely observe. Existing crash-frequency models and surrogate safety metrics rely heavily on sparse, noisy, and under-reported records, while even sophisticated, high-fidelity simulations undersample the long-tailed situations that trigger catastrophic outcomes such as fatalities. We argue that the path to achieving Vision Zero, i.e., the complete elimination of traffic fatalities and severe injuries, requires a paradigm shift from traditional crash-only learning to a new form of counterfactual safety learning: reasoning not only about what happened, but also about the vast set of plausible yet perilous scenarios that could have happened under slightly different circumstances. To operationalize this shift, our proposed agenda bridges macro to micro. Guided by crash-rate priors, generative scene engines, diverse driver models, and causal learning, near-miss events are synthesized and explained. A crash-focused digital twin testbed links micro scenes to macro patterns, while a multi-objective validator ensures that simulations maintain statistical realism. This pipeline transforms sparse crash data into rich signals for crash prediction, enabling the stress-testing of vehicles, roads, and policies before deployment. By learning from crashes that almost happened, we can shift traffic safety from reactive forensics to proactive prevention, advancing Vision Zero.

Summary: In this new research, the role of hidden units in recurrent neural networks is examined from a different perspective. Instead of just being memory stores, hidden units are considered as active participants in network computation. The study focuses on bi-linear operations, which involve interactions between hidden units and input embeddings. The research shows that these operations serve as a natural inductive bias for representing the evolution of hidden states in state tracking tasks. It is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that bi-linear state updates correspond to a hierarchy of increasing complexity in state tracking tasks, with popular linear recurrent networks like Mamba at the lowest level of complexity. This study sheds new light on the importance of hidden units in network behavior and provides insights into their active role in computations. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.21749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of hidden units in recurrent neural networks is typically seen as modeling memory, with research focusing on enhancing information retention through gating mechanisms. A less explored perspective views hidden units as active participants in the computation performed by the network, rather than passive memory stores. In this work, we revisit bi-linear operations, which involve multiplicative interactions between hidden units and input embeddings. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that they constitute a natural inductive bias for representing the evolution of hidden states in state tracking tasks. These are the simplest type of task that require hidden units to actively contribute to the behavior of the network. We also show that bi-linear state updates form a natural hierarchy corresponding to state tracking tasks of increasing complexity, with popular linear recurrent networks such as Mamba residing at the lowest-complexity center of that hierarchy.

Summary: <br />
Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) tackles the challenge of making decisions at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. The dynamic nature of low-level policies poses a difficulty for high-level policies to generate effective subgoals. This study introduces a novel approach that combines a conditional diffusion model with a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a diverse set of subgoals while considering uncertainty. By incorporating GP uncertainty quantification, the proposed method surpasses existing HRL techniques in terms of both sample efficiency and performance on continuous control benchmarks. By selecting subgoals from the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean, this strategy improves decision-making capabilities in complex environments. <div>
arXiv:2505.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) learns to make decisions on multiple levels of temporal abstraction. A key challenge in HRL is that the low-level policy changes over time, making it difficult for the high-level policy to generate effective subgoals. To address this issue, the high-level policy must capture a complex subgoal distribution while also accounting for uncertainty in its estimates. We propose an approach that trains a conditional diffusion model regularized by a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a complex variety of subgoals while leveraging principled GP uncertainty quantification. Building on this framework, we develop a strategy that selects subgoals from both the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean. Our approach outperforms prior HRL methods in both sample efficiency and performance on challenging continuous control benchmarks.

Summary: 
DualSchool introduces a framework for assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in generating duals of linear programs. The framework uses a verification procedure based on Canonical Graph Edit Distance, providing more accurate evaluation compared to existing methods. Experiments show that while LLMs can accurately recite the conversion procedure, they struggle to consistently produce correct duals, even for small instances. This finding has implications for educators, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on LLMs for optimization tasks. It also raises questions about the development of large reasoning systems and the need for further research in the intersection of AI and operations research. <div>
arXiv:2505.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following task taught in introductory optimization courses which addresses challenges articulated by the community at the intersection of (generative) AI and OR: generate the dual of a linear program. LLMs, being trained at web-scale, have the conversion process and many instances of Primal to Dual Conversion (P2DC) at their disposal. Students may thus reasonably expect that LLMs would perform well on the P2DC task. To assess this expectation, this paper introduces DualSchool, a comprehensive framework for generating and verifying P2DC instances. The verification procedure of DualSchool uses the Canonical Graph Edit Distance, going well beyond existing evaluation methods for optimization models, which exhibit many false positives and negatives when applied to P2DC. Experiments performed by DualSchool reveal interesting findings. Although LLMs can recite the conversion procedure accurately, state-of-the-art open LLMs fail to consistently produce correct duals. This finding holds even for the smallest two-variable instances and for derivative tasks, such as correctness, verification, and error classification. The paper also discusses the implications for educators, students, and the development of large reasoning systems.

<div> Hopfield networks, associative memory, diffusion models, spurious states, training data<br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores the connection between diffusion models and associative memories (AMs), specifically focusing on the phenomenon of spurious states that occur in Hopfield networks when training data reaches its critical memory load. The training phase of the diffusion model is compared to memory encoding in AMs, while the generation phase represents memory retrieval. In the small data regime, the diffusion model behaves similarly to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load, creating distinct basins of attraction around each sample. In the large data regime, new attractor states are formed corresponding to manifolds of generated samples, with spurious states emerging at the transition boundary. These spurious states exhibit distinct basins of attraction despite not being in the training set. The study offers a new perspective on memorization-generalization in diffusion models, predicts the existence of spurious states, and provides empirical validation of these predictions in commonly-used diffusion models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.

<div> Node selection strategy, Poisson processes, Graph Neural Networks, over-smoothing, structure-aware updates

Summary:
The article addresses the issue of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by proposing a novel node selection strategy based on Poisson processes. This strategy introduces stochastic and structure-aware updates for nodes, preventing node representations from converging too quickly and losing discriminative power. By equipping each node with an independent Poisson clock, the approach allows for asynchronous and localized updates that preserve structural diversity. The study explores two applications of the Poisson-based method: as a replacement for traditional dropout-based regularization and as a dynamic subgraph training scheme. Experimental results on standard benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches like Dropout, DropEdge, and DropNode, especially in later training stages. This showcases the effectiveness and competitiveness of the Poisson-based strategy in improving GNN performance.

Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a major challenge in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to converge and lose discriminative power. To address this, we propose a novel node selection strategy based on Poisson processes, introducing stochastic but structure-aware updates. Specifically, we equip each node with an independent Poisson clock, enabling asynchronous and localized updates that preserve structural diversity. We explore two applications of this strategy: as a replacement for dropout-based regularization and as a dynamic subgraph training scheme. Experimental results on standard benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) demonstrate that our Poisson-based method yields competitive or improved accuracy compared to traditional Dropout, DropEdge, and DropNode approaches, particularly in later training stages.

<div> limitations, sequence-to-sequence tasks, Transformers, pretraining data, length generalization

Summary:
Pretraining of large-scale Language Models (LLMs) such as Transformers may not fully overcome theoretical limitations in modeling certain sequence-to-sequence tasks. A study of retrieval and copying tasks revealed an induction-versus-anti-induction asymmetry in pretrained models, with better performance in retrieving tokens to the right rather than the left of a query token. This asymmetry can be eliminated through targeted fine-tuning if length generalization is guaranteed. Analysis showed that the strength of induction versus anti-induction circuits within pretrained Transformers contributes to this asymmetry. Practical experiments on real-world tasks confirmed these findings and highlighted the need to consider reliability risks in utilizing pretrained models. Pretraining selectively enhances specific capabilities of Transformers but does not eliminate fundamental length-generalization limits.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain sequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations play a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively overcome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models themselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural constraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of $\textit{retrieval}$ and $\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al. [2024]. We use the recently proposed C-RASP framework for studying length generalization [Huang et al., 2025b] to provide guarantees for each of our settings. Empirically, we observe an $\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$ asymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right (induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This asymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is guaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is connected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction circuits within pretrained Transformers. We validate our findings through practical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our results highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain Transformer capabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.

Abstract: We design new differentially private algorithms for the problems of adversarial bandits and bandits with expert advice. For adversarial bandits, we give a simple and efficient conversion of any non-private bandit algorithm to a private bandit algorithm. Instantiating our conversion with existing non-private bandit algorithms gives a regret upper bound of $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right)$, improving upon the existing upper bound $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT \log(KT)}}{\epsilon}\right)$ for all $\epsilon \leq 1$. In particular, our algorithms allow for sublinear expected regret even when $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$, establishing the first known separation between central and local differential privacy for this problem. For bandits with expert advice, we give the first differentially private algorithms, with expected regret $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{NT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right), O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT\log(N)}\log(KT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, and $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{N^{1/6}K^{1/2}T^{2/3}\log(NT)}{\epsilon ^{1/3}} + \frac{N^{1/2}\log(NT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $K$ and $N$ are the number of actions and experts respectively. These rates allow us to get sublinear regret for different combinations of small and large $K, N$ and $\epsilon.$

In the paper "Multimodal Federated Learning: A Taxonomy of Challenges and Opportunities," the authors explore the intersection of two key research areas: leveraging multimodal data to enhance inference performance and enabling distributed training for efficiency and privacy preservation. The absence of a comprehensive taxonomy for Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is addressed, focusing on Horizontal FL (HFL), Vertical FL (VFL), and Hybrid FL paradigms. The paper examines the problem formulations, algorithms, and challenges associated with each paradigm in the context of multimodal data.

arXiv:2505.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) lies at the intersection of two pivotal research areas: leveraging complementary information from multiple modalities to improve downstream inference performance and enabling distributed training to enhance efficiency and preserve privacy. Despite the growing interest in MFL, there is currently no comprehensive taxonomy that organizes MFL through the lens of different Federated Learning (FL) paradigms. This perspective is important because multimodal data introduces distinct challenges across various FL settings. These challenges, including modality heterogeneity, privacy heterogeneity, and communication inefficiency, are fundamentally different from those encountered in traditional unimodal or non-FL scenarios. In this paper, we systematically examine MFL within the context of three major FL paradigms: horizontal FL (HFL), vertical FL (VFL), and hybrid FL. For each paradigm, we present the problem formulation, review representative training algorithms, and highlight the most prominent challenge introduced by multimodal data in distributed settings. We also discuss open challenges and provide insights for future research. By establishing this taxonomy, we aim to uncover the novel challenges posed by multimodal data from the perspective of different FL paradigms and to offer a new lens through which to understand and advance the development of MFL.

Summary:<br />
This article explores the truthfulness of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate factual statements. By extending the concept cone framework to the domain of truth, the researchers identify multidimensional cones that influence how LLMs behave in response to true/false propositions. Through causal interventions, it is shown that these cones play a crucial role in mediating truth-related behavior across different LLM families. The study demonstrates that these cones can flip model responses to factual statements, generalize across model architectures, and preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings suggest a more complex, multidirectional geometry underlying the truthfulness of simple propositions in LLMs and highlight the potential of concept cones as a valuable tool for investigating abstract behaviors. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong conversational abilities but often generate falsehoods. Prior work suggests that the truthfulness of simple propositions can be represented as a single linear direction in a model's internal activations, but this may not fully capture its underlying geometry. In this work, we extend the concept cone framework, recently introduced for modeling refusal, to the domain of truth. We identify multi-dimensional cones that causally mediate truth-related behavior across multiple LLM families. Our results are supported by three lines of evidence: (i) causal interventions reliably flip model responses to factual statements, (ii) learned cones generalize across model architectures, and (iii) cone-based interventions preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings reveal the richer, multidirectional structure governing simple true/false propositions in LLMs and highlight concept cones as a promising tool for probing abstract behaviors.

Summary:
In the study, the challenges hindering the operational deployment of a fully automated greenhouse gas plume detection system using imaging spectroscopy were reviewed and addressed. Key obstacles such as data and label quality control, spatiotemporal biases, and modeling objectives alignment were tackled. The study demonstrated that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve operational detection performance when these obstacles are alleviated. A multitask model combining instance detection and pixelwise segmentation was shown to be effective in leading towards operational deployment. The model's ability to detect plumes across emission source types and regions was evaluated, establishing thresholds for operational readiness.

Abstract: Operational deployment of a fully automated greenhouse gas (GHG) plume detection system remains an elusive goal for imaging spectroscopy missions, despite recent advances in deep learning approaches. With the dramatic increase in data availability, however, automation continues to increase in importance for natural and anthropogenic emissions monitoring. This work reviews and addresses several key obstacles in the field: data and label quality control, prevention of spatiotemporal biases, and correctly aligned modeling objectives. We demonstrate through rigorous experiments using multicampaign data from airborne and spaceborne instruments that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to achieve operational detection performance when these obstacles are alleviated. We demonstrate that a multitask model that learns both instance detection and pixelwise segmentation simultaneously can successfully lead towards an operational pathway. We evaluate the model's plume detectability across emission source types and regions, identifying thresholds for operational deployment. Finally, we provide analysis-ready data, models, and source code for reproducibility, and work to define a set of best practices and validation standards to facilitate future contributions to the field.

Existing models like gradient boosting machines and deep models excel in performance but lack interpretability. By incorporating custom reward functions, the proposed model not only focuses on accurate predictions but also generates human-understandable explanations.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on tabular data is the cornerstone of many real-world applications. Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most existing LLMs.

The paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing Data Augmentation (DA) strategies in machine learning. By viewing DA from a probabilistic standpoint, the authors treat augmentation parameters as model (hyper)parameters and optimize the marginal likelihood through a Bayesian model selection approach. A tractable Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) is derived to enable joint optimization of augmentation parameters and model parameters. Theoretical results on variational approximation quality, generalization guarantees, invariance properties, and links to empirical Bayes are provided. Experimental results on computer vision tasks demonstrate improved calibration and robust performance compared to fixed or no augmentation strategies. The work establishes a rigorous foundation for optimizing DA using Bayesian principles, offering significant potential for enhancing robustness in machine learning.

Abstract: Data Augmentation (DA) has become an essential tool to improve robustness and generalization of modern machine learning. However, when deciding on DA strategies it is critical to choose parameters carefully, and this can be a daunting task which is traditionally left to trial-and-error or expensive optimization based on validation performance. In this paper, we counter these limitations by proposing a novel framework for optimizing DA. In particular, we take a probabilistic view of DA, which leads to the interpretation of augmentation parameters as model (hyper)-parameters, and the optimization of the marginal likelihood with respect to these parameters as a Bayesian model selection problem. Due to its intractability, we derive a tractable Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO), which allows us to optimize augmentation parameters jointly with model parameters. We provide extensive theoretical results on variational approximation quality, generalization guarantees, invariance properties, and connections to empirical Bayes. Through experiments on computer vision tasks, we show that our approach improves calibration and yields robust performance over fixed or no augmentation. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for optimizing DA through Bayesian principles with significant potential for robust machine learning.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel unsupervised framework for predicting the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by integrating Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with statistical techniques. T2DM poses significant health and economic challenges, making early detection crucial. Traditional supervised learning approaches are limited by the lack of confirmed negative cases, leading to the development of this new method. By identifying latent patterns of multimorbidity and polypharmacy among diagnosed T2DM patients, the framework estimates T2DM risk in undiagnosed individuals. This data-driven approach provides interpretable insights for healthcare providers to implement timely interventions, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the future health and economic burden of T2DM. <div>

Abstract: The global prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is rapidly increasing, posing significant health and economic challenges. T2DM not only disrupts blood glucose regulation but also damages vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. In the US alone, the economic burden of diagnosed diabetes exceeded \$400 billion in 2022. Early detection of individuals at risk is critical to mitigating these impacts. While machine learning approaches for T2DM prediction are increasingly adopted, many rely on supervised learning, which is often limited by the lack of confirmed negative cases. To address this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised framework that integrates Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with statistical techniques to identify individuals at risk of developing T2DM. Our method identifies latent patterns of multimorbidity and polypharmacy among diagnosed T2DM patients and applies these patterns to estimate the T2DM risk in undiagnosed individuals. By leveraging data-driven insights from comorbidity and medication usage, our approach provides an interpretable and scalable solution that can assist healthcare providers in implementing timely interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and potentially reducing the future health and economic burden of T2DM.

Summary:
In the study, the researchers focused on the optimal allocation of inference-time computation in large language models for reasoning tasks. They explored whether sequential scaling or parallel scaling was more effective in improving performance. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on various language models, including those trained specifically for graph connectivity problems, they discovered scenarios where sequential scaling provided an exponential advantage over parallel scaling. These findings were particularly evident in challenging distributions of graphs. The research sheds light on the importance of considering different strategies for reasoning tasks and highlights the potential benefits of sequential scaling in certain scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2505.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time computation has emerged as a promising scaling axis for improving large language model reasoning. However, despite yielding impressive performance, the optimal allocation of inference-time computation remains poorly understood. A central question is whether to prioritize sequential scaling (e.g., longer chains of thought) or parallel scaling (e.g., majority voting across multiple short chains of thought). In this work, we seek to illuminate the landscape of test-time scaling by demonstrating the existence of reasoning settings where sequential scaling offers an exponential advantage over parallel scaling. These settings are based on graph connectivity problems in challenging distributions of graphs. We validate our theoretical findings with comprehensive experiments across a range of language models, including models trained from scratch for graph connectivity with different chain of thought strategies as well as large reasoning models.

Summary:
Adam optimization algorithm has shown remarkable efficacy in training transformer-based language models. Various simplified versions of Adam, such as signed momentum methods, have been proposed but consistently underperform relative to Adam. However, constraining the momentum parameters in Adam to be equal preserves near-optimal performance while offering new insights and formulations. This choice not only ensures robust performance but also allows for a statistical interpretation, showing that Adam can be viewed as an online algorithm for estimating gradient mean and variance from a mean-field Gaussian variational inference perspective. This study conducted over 1,300 language models highlights the significance of Adam in optimization and sheds light on the "secret sauce" behind its success. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the remarkable efficacy of Adam when training transformer-based language models has become a central research topic within the optimization community. To gain deeper insights, several simplifications of Adam have been proposed, such as the signed gradient and signed momentum methods. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study - training over 1,300 language models across different data configurations and scales - comparing Adam to several known simplified variants. We find that signed momentum methods are faster than SGD, but consistently underperform relative to Adam, even after careful tuning of momentum, clipping setting and learning rates. However, our analysis reveals a compelling option that preserves near-optimal performance while allowing for new insightful reformulations: constraining the Adam momentum parameters to be equal. Beyond robust performance, this choice affords new theoretical insights, highlights the "secret sauce" on top of signed momentum, and grants a precise statistical interpretation: we show that Adam in this setting implements a natural online algorithm for estimating the mean and variance of gradients-one that arises from a mean-field Gaussian variational inference perspective.

Joint fine-tuning and compression methods are proposed to reduce model size after training, aiming to create a smaller model directly guided by the downstream task. This approach avoids sacrificing performance and eliminates the need for a larger intermediate model. By gradually distilling the model to a pruned low-rank structure, the joint fine-tuning and compression method outperforms sequential compression techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in significantly reducing model size while maintaining performance in downstream tasks. <div>

Abstract: To reduce model size during post-training, compression methods, including knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, and pruning, are often applied after fine-tuning the model. However, sequential fine-tuning and compression sacrifices performance, while creating a larger than necessary model as an intermediate step. In this work, we aim to reduce this gap, by directly constructing a smaller model while guided by the downstream task. We propose to jointly fine-tune and compress the model by gradually distilling it to a pruned low-rank structure. Experiments demonstrate that joint fine-tuning and compression significantly outperforms other sequential compression methods.

Abstract: Online safe reinforcement learning (RL) plays a key role in dynamic environments, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and cybersecurity. The objective is to learn optimal policies that maximize rewards while satisfying safety constraints modeled by constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). Existing methods achieve sublinear regret under stochastic constraints but often fail in adversarial settings, where constraints are unknown, time-varying, and potentially adversarially designed. In this paper, we propose the Optimistic Mirror Descent Primal-Dual (OMDPD) algorithm, the first to address online CMDPs with anytime adversarial constraints. OMDPD achieves optimal regret O(sqrt(K)) and strong constraint violation O(sqrt(K)) without relying on Slater's condition or the existence of a strictly known safe policy. We further show that access to accurate estimates of rewards and transitions can further improve these bounds. Our results offer practical guarantees for safe decision-making in adversarial environments.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in safe reinforcement learning (RL) is a method to ensure the safety of a policy throughout the entire process, from learning to operation. However, existing safe RL paradigms inherently struggle to achieve this objective. We propose a method, called Provably Lifetime Safe RL (PLS), that integrates offline safe RL with safe policy deployment to address this challenge. Our proposed method learns a policy offline using return-conditioned supervised learning and then deploys the resulting policy while cautiously optimizing a limited set of parameters, known as target returns, using Gaussian processes (GPs). Theoretically, we justify the use of GPs by analyzing the mathematical relationship between target and actual returns. We then prove that PLS finds near-optimal target returns while guaranteeing safety with high probability. Empirically, we demonstrate that PLS outperforms baselines both in safety and reward performance, thereby achieving the longstanding goal to obtain high rewards while ensuring the safety of a policy throughout the lifetime from learning to operation.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian model averaging, ensemble learning, pre-trained models, classification, optimization

Summary:
In this study, the authors propose a novel approach to enhance classification performance on image and text data by leveraging Bayesian model averaging (BMA) with pre-trained or lightly-finetuned foundation models. They introduce trainable linear classifiers that take features from these models as inputs, allowing for model ensembling based on model posteriors. Additionally, they present a computationally efficient model averaging scheme (OMA) where ensemble weights are optimized to reduce prediction surprise. These methods provide a principled way to combine multiple models and enhance classification tasks, making it possible to incorporate future, improved foundation models for even better performance. <div>

Abstract: We revisit the classical, full-fledged Bayesian model averaging (BMA) paradigm to ensemble pre-trained and/or lightly-finetuned foundation models to enhance the classification performance on image and text data. To make BMA tractable under foundation models, we introduce trainable linear classifiers that take frozen features from the pre-trained foundation models as inputs. The model posteriors over the linear classifiers tell us which linear heads and frozen features are better suited for a given dataset, resulting in a principled model ensembling method. Furthermore, we propose a computationally cheaper, optimizable model averaging scheme (OMA). In OMA, we directly optimize the model ensemble weights, just like those weights based on model posterior distributions in BMA, by reducing the amount of surprise (expected entropy of the predictions) we get from predictions of ensembled models. With the rapid development of foundation models, these approaches will enable the incorporation of future, possibly significantly better foundation models to enhance the performance of challenging classification tasks.

<div> Keywords: Batch Normalisation, Federated Learning, Statistical Parameters, Hybrid Batch Normalisation, Global Statistics

Summary:
Hybrid Batch Normalisation (HBN) is introduced as a solution for the challenge of applying Batch Normalisation (BN) in federated learning, where data among client nodes is not identically distributed. HBN separates the update of statistical parameters from learnable parameters, allowing for unbiased estimation of global statistical parameters in distributed scenarios. By introducing a learnable hybrid distribution factor, HBN enables each computing node to adaptively mix current batch statistics with global statistics, improving federated learning performance. This approach emphasizes the importance of global statistics in shaping the learning process across varying federated learning settings, particularly beneficial for small batch sizes and heterogeneous data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch Normalisation (BN) is widely used in conventional deep neural network training to harmonise the input-output distributions for each batch of data. However, federated learning, a distributed learning paradigm, faces the challenge of dealing with non-independent and identically distributed data among the client nodes. Due to the lack of a coherent methodology for updating BN statistical parameters, standard BN degrades the federated learning performance. To this end, it is urgent to explore an alternative normalisation solution for federated learning. In this work, we resolve the dilemma of the BN layer in federated learning by developing a customised normalisation approach, Hybrid Batch Normalisation (HBN). HBN separates the update of statistical parameters (i.e. , means and variances used for evaluation) from that of learnable parameters (i.e. , parameters that require gradient updates), obtaining unbiased estimates of global statistical parameters in distributed scenarios. In contrast with the existing solutions, we emphasise the supportive power of global statistics for federated learning. The HBN layer introduces a learnable hybrid distribution factor, allowing each computing node to adaptively mix the statistical parameters of the current batch with the global statistics. Our HBN can serve as a powerful plugin to advance federated learning performance. It reflects promising merits across a wide range of federated learning settings, especially for small batch sizes and heterogeneous data.

<div> Keywords: tennis tournaments, momentum, HydraNet, multi-granularity analysis, state-space duality<br />
Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel Momentum Score (MS) metric and HydraNet framework to model momentum in tennis tournaments. The framework integrates thirty-two dimensions of athlete performance and employs a Hydra module based on a state-space duality (SSD) framework to capture explicit and implicit momentum. It also includes a Versus Learning method to enhance the adversarial nature of momentum between athletes and a Collaborative-Adversarial Attention Mechanism (CAAM) for dynamic momentum integration. A million-level tennis cross-tournament dataset is used to validate the HydraNet framework's capabilities in modeling momentum at different granularities. Experimental results demonstrate that the MS metric provides valuable insights into the impact of momentum on match outcomes. This research establishes a new foundation for momentum modeling and sports analysis in tennis tournaments.

Abstract: In tennis tournaments, momentum, a critical yet elusive phenomenon, reflects the dynamic shifts in performance of athletes that can decisively influence match outcomes. Despite its significance, momentum in terms of effective modeling and multi-granularity analysis across points, games, sets, and matches in tennis tournaments remains underexplored. In this study, we define a novel Momentum Score (MS) metric to quantify a player's momentum level in multi-granularity tennis tournaments, and design HydraNet, a momentum-driven state-space duality-based framework, to model MS by integrating thirty-two heterogeneous dimensions of athletes performance in serve, return, psychology and fatigue. HydraNet integrates a Hydra module, which builds upon a state-space duality (SSD) framework, capturing explicit momentum with a sliding-window mechanism and implicit momentum through cross-game state propagation. It also introduces a novel Versus Learning method to better enhance the adversarial nature of momentum between the two athletes at a macro level, along with a Collaborative-Adversarial Attention Mechanism (CAAM) for capturing and integrating intra-player and inter-player dynamic momentum at a micro level. Additionally, we construct a million-level tennis cross-tournament dataset spanning from 2012-2023 Wimbledon and 2013-2023 US Open, and validate the multi-granularity modeling capability of HydraNet for the MS metric on this dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the MS metric constructed by the HydraNet framework provides actionable insights into how momentum impacts outcomes at different granularities, establishing a new foundation for momentum modeling and sports analysis. To the best of our knowledge. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/ReyJerry/HydraNet.

<div> Keywords: Preference learning, generative models, diffusion models, optimization, off-policy bias

Summary: 
Preference learning is crucial for aligning generative models with human expectations, with recent advancements extending to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, challenges such as timestep-dependent instability and off-policy bias hinder the performance of existing approaches like Diffusion-DPO. To address these issues, a new practical strategy, DPO-C\&amp;M, is introduced to improve stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Additionally, a principled framework, SDPO, incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that both DPO-C\&amp;M and SDPO outperform standard Diffusion-DPO in terms of VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These findings underscore the significance of optimized, distribution-corrected techniques in diffusion-based preference learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\&amp;M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.

<title>Compressing Sine-Activated Low-Rank Adapters through Post-Training Quantization</title>

arXiv:2505.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering substantial reductions in trainable parameters by modeling updates as the product of two low-rank matrices. While effective, the low-rank constraint inherently limits representational capacity, often resulting in reduced performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. Recent work by Ji et al. (2025) has addressed this limitation by applying a fixed-frequency sinusoidal transformation to low-rank adapters, increasing their stable rank without introducing additional parameters. This raises a crucial question: can the same sine-activated technique be successfully applied within the context of Post-Training Quantization to retain benefits even after model compression? In this paper, we investigate this question by extending the sinusoidal transformation framework to quantized LoRA adapters. We develop a theoretical analysis showing that the stable rank of a quantized adapter is tightly linked to that of its full-precision counterpart, motivating the use of such rank-enhancing functions even under quantization. Our results demonstrate that the expressivity gains from a sinusoidal non-linearity persist after quantization, yielding highly compressed adapters with negligible loss in performance. We validate our approach across a range of fine-tuning tasks for language, vision and text-to-image generation achieving significant memory savings while maintaining competitive accuracy.

<title>Reinforcement Learning for Out-of-Distribution Reasoning in LLMs: An Empirical Study on Diagnosis-Related Group Coding</title>

Abstract: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.

<title>Taming Transformer Without Using Learning Rate Warmup</title>

Abstract: Scaling Transformer to a large scale without using some technical tricks such as learning rate warump and using an obviously lower learning rate is an extremely challenging task, and is increasingly gaining more attention. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis for the process of training Transformer and reveal the rationale behind the model crash phenomenon in the training process, termed \textit{spectral energy concentration} of ${\bW_q}^{\top} \bW_k$, which is the reason for a malignant entropy collapse, where ${\bW_q}$ and $\bW_k$ are the projection matrices for the query and the key in Transformer, respectively. To remedy this problem, motivated by \textit{Weyl's Inequality}, we present a novel optimization strategy, \ie, making the weight updating in successive steps smooth -- if the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}$ is larger than a threshold, we will automatically bound the learning rate to a weighted multiple of $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}$, where $\nabla \bW_t$ is the updating quantity in step $t$. Such an optimization strategy can prevent spectral energy concentration to only a few directions, and thus can avoid malignant entropy collapse which will trigger the model crash. We conduct extensive experiments using ViT, Swin-Transformer and GPT, showing that our optimization strategy can effectively and stably train these Transformers without using learning rate warmup.

Abstract: We developed a deep learning algorithm for human activity recognition using sensor signals as input. In this study, we built a pretrained language model based on the Transformer architecture, which is widely used in natural language processing. By leveraging this pretrained model, we aimed to improve performance on the downstream task of human activity recognition. While this task can be addressed using a vanilla Transformer, we propose an enhanced n-dimensional numerical processing Transformer that incorporates three key features: embedding n-dimensional numerical data through a linear layer, binning-based pre-processing, and a linear transformation in the output layer. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed model across five different datasets. Compared to the vanilla Transformer, our model demonstrated 10%-15% improvements in accuracy.

Abstract: Designing analog circuits from performance specifications is a complex, multi-stage process encompassing topology selection, parameter inference, and layout feasibility. We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20 expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99\% accuracy in topology inference, <10\% relative error in performance prediction, and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.

<title>Efficient Ensemble for Fine-tuning Language Models on Multiple Datasets</title>

Abstract: This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to multiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$ groups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during fine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\%$ error on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true fine-tuning performances under $5\%$ error while speeding up computation compared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times. When applied to fine-tune Llama and GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to $10\%$ higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only $9\%$ more FLOPs. On a Llama model with $34$ billion parameters, an ensemble of QLoRA increases test accuracy by $3\%$ compared to QLoRA, with only $8\%$ more FLOPs.

<title>Practical Adversarial Attacks on Stochastic Bandits via Fake Data Injection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits have traditionally relied on some unrealistic assumptions, such as per-round reward manipulation and unbounded perturbations, limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We propose a more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model, explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies, revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has remained a significant challenge for deep neural networks as learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge, either partially or completely. Existing solutions often rely on experience rehearsal or full model surrogates to mitigate CF. While effective, these approaches introduce substantial memory and computational overhead, limiting their scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose SPARC, a scalable CL approach that eliminates the need for experience rehearsal and full-model surrogates. By effectively combining task-specific working memories and task-agnostic semantic memory for cross-task knowledge consolidation, SPARC results in a remarkable parameter efficiency, using only 6% of the parameters required by full-model surrogates. Despite its lightweight design, SPARC achieves superior performance on Seq-TinyImageNet and matches rehearsal-based methods on various CL benchmarks. Additionally, weight re-normalization in the classification layer mitigates task-specific biases, establishing SPARC as a practical and scalable solution for CL under stringent efficiency constraints.

Abstract: Two-way partial AUC (TPAUC) is a critical performance metric for binary classification with imbalanced data, as it focuses on specific ranges of the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). However, stochastic algorithms for TPAUC optimization remain under-explored, with existing methods either limited to approximated TPAUC loss functions or burdened by sub-optimal complexities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two innovative stochastic primal-dual double block-coordinate algorithms for TPAUC maximization. These algorithms utilize stochastic block-coordinate updates for both the primal and dual variables, catering to both convex and non-convex settings. We provide theoretical convergence rate analyses, demonstrating significant improvements over prior approaches. Our experimental results, based on multiple benchmark datasets, validate the superior performance of our algorithms, showcasing faster convergence and better generalization. This work advances the state of the art in TPAUC optimization and offers practical tools for real-world machine learning applications.

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex, super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations. By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\% improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated evaluation of free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs) is challenging because many distinct answers can be equally valid. A common practice is to use LLMs themselves as judges, but the theoretical properties of this approach are not yet well understood. We show that a geometric framework that represents both judges and candidates as points on a probability simplex can provide helpful insight on what is or is not identifiable using LLM judges. Our theoretical analysis uncovers a "phase transition" in ranking identifiability: for binary scoring systems, true rankings are identifiable even with weak judges under mild assumptions, while rankings become non-identifiable for three or more scoring levels even with infinite data, absent additional prior knowledge. This non-identifiability highlights how uncertainty in rankings stems from not only aleatoric uncertainty (i.e., inherent stochasticity in the data) but also epistemic uncertainty regarding which assumptions hold, an aspect that has received limited attention until now. To integrate both types of uncertainty, we use Bayesian inference to encode assumptions as priors and conduct sensitivity analysis of ranking estimates and credible intervals. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Bayesian inference yields more accurate rankings and substantially improves coverage rates. These results underscore the importance of taking a more holistic approach to uncertainty quantification when using LLMs as judges.

<title>BOFormer: Learning to Solve Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization via Non-Markovian RL</title>

arXiv:2505.21974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) offers an efficient pipeline for optimizing black-box functions with the help of a Gaussian process prior and an acquisition function (AF). Recently, in the context of single-objective BO, learning-based AFs witnessed promising empirical results given its favorable non-myopic nature. Despite this, the direct extension of these approaches to multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) suffer from the \textit{hypervolume identifiability issue}, which results from the non-Markovian nature of MOBO problems. To tackle this, inspired by the non-Markovian RL literature and the success of Transformers in language modeling, we present a generalized deep Q-learning framework and propose \textit{BOFormer}, which substantiates this framework for MOBO via sequence modeling. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BOFormer constantly outperforms the benchmark rule-based and learning-based algorithms in various synthetic MOBO and real-world multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problems. We have made the source code publicly available to encourage further research in this direction.

arXiv:2505.21978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature generation is a critical step in machine learning, aiming to enhance model performance by capturing complex relationships within the data and generating meaningful new features. Traditional feature generation methods heavily rely on domain expertise and manual intervention, making the process labor-intensive and challenging to adapt to different scenarios. Although automated feature generation techniques address these issues to some extent, they often face challenges such as feature redundancy, inefficiency in feature space exploration, and limited adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. To address these problems, we propose a Two-Stage Feature Generation (TSFG) framework, which integrates a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The encoder-decoder model in TSFG leverages the Transformer's self-attention mechanism to efficiently represent and transform features, capturing complex dependencies within the data. PPO further enhances TSFG by dynamically adjusting the feature generation strategy based on task-specific feedback, optimizing the process for improved performance and adaptability. TSFG dynamically generates high-quality feature sets, significantly improving the predictive performance of machine learning models. Experimental results demonstrate that TSFG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of feature quality and adaptability.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), the demand for memory and computational resources has grown significantly. Recent advances in LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models. However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63% decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.

<title>Learning in Compact Spaces with Approximately Normalized Transformers</title>

Abstract: In deep learning, regularization and normalization are common solutions for challenges such as overfitting, numerical instabilities, and the increasing variance in the residual stream. An alternative approach is to force all parameters and representations to lie on a hypersphere. This removes the need for regularization and increases convergence speed, but comes with additional costs. In this work, we propose a more holistic but approximate normalization (anTransformer). Our approach constrains the norm of parameters and normalizes all representations via scalar multiplications motivated by the tight concentration of the norms of high-dimensional random vectors. When applied to GPT training, we observe a 40% faster convergence compared to models with QK normalization, with less than 3% additional runtime. Deriving scaling laws for anGPT, we found our method enables training with larger batch sizes and fewer hyperparameters, while matching the favorable scaling characteristics of classic GPT architectures.

<title>Weakly-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Imprecise Class Labels</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22028</link>

Abstract: Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success in learning effective representations, with supervised contrastive learning often outperforming self-supervised approaches. However, in real-world scenarios, data annotations are often ambiguous or inaccurate, meaning that class labels may not reliably indicate whether two examples belong to the same class. This limitation restricts the applicability of supervised contrastive learning. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of ``continuous semantic similarity'' to define positive and negative pairs. Instead of directly relying on imprecise class labels, we measure the semantic similarity between example pairs, which quantifies how closely they belong to the same category by iteratively refining weak supervisory signals. Based on this concept, we propose a graph-theoretic framework for weakly-supervised contrastive learning, where semantic similarity serves as the graph weights. Our framework is highly versatile and can be applied to many weakly-supervised learning scenarios. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments in two common settings, i.e., noisy label and partial label learning, where existing methods can be easily integrated to significantly improve performance. Theoretically, we establish an error bound for our approach, showing that it can approximate supervised contrastive learning under mild conditions. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Speechless-10308/WSC.

<title>Detecting Undesired Process Behavior by Means of Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22041</link>

Abstract: Conformance checking techniques detect undesired process behavior by comparing process executions that are recorded in event logs to desired behavior that is captured in a dedicated process model. If such models are not available, conformance checking techniques are not applicable, but organizations might still be interested in detecting undesired behavior in their processes. To enable this, existing approaches use Large Language Models (LLMs), assuming that they can learn to distinguish desired from undesired behavior through fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and the fine-tuned LLMs often do not generalize well. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that requires neither a dedicated process model nor resource-intensive fine-tuning to detect undesired process behavior. Instead, we use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide an LLM with direct access to a knowledge base that contains both desired and undesired process behavior from other processes, assuming that the LLM can transfer this knowledge to the process at hand. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms fine-tuned LLMs in detecting undesired behavior, demonstrating that RAG is a viable alternative to resource-intensive fine-tuning, particularly when enriched with relevant context from the event log, such as frequent traces and activities.

<title>Estimating the Effects of Sample Training Orders for Large Language Models without Retraining</title>

Abstract: The order of training samples plays a crucial role in large language models (LLMs), significantly impacting both their external performance and internal learning dynamics. Traditional methods for investigating this effect generally require retraining the model with various sample orders, which is computationally infeasible for LLMs. In this work, we improve traditional methods by designing a retraining-free framework. By approximating Adam optimizer updates with first- and second-order Taylor expansions and utilizing random projection methods to store intermediate checkpoints, our framework can efficiently estimate model parameters for arbitrary training sample orders. Next, we apply our framework to two downstream research problems: (1) Training curriculum design for LLMs -- we base our retraining-free framework to propose a novel curriculum learning strategy that augments curriculum proposals with estimated model performances, enabling more informed sample scheduling. (2) LLMs' memorization and generalization effect analysis -- we use our retraining-free framework to estimate how the positions of training samples influence LLMs' capacity for memorization and generalization. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our retraining-free framework in reproducing the true model performances, and further demonstrate its potential in optimizing LLM training curricula and analyzing the memorization and generalization effects of LLMs.

<title>Differentiable Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Plans</title>

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space, finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii) it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings. We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is essential.

<title>The Resurrection of the ReLU</title>

Abstract: Modeling sophisticated activation functions within deep learning architectures has evolved into a distinct research direction. Functions such as GELU, SELU, and SiLU offer smooth gradients and improved convergence properties, making them popular choices in state-of-the-art models. Despite this trend, the classical ReLU remains appealing due to its simplicity, inherent sparsity, and other advantageous topological characteristics. However, ReLU units are prone to becoming irreversibly inactive - a phenomenon known as the dying ReLU problem - which limits their overall effectiveness. In this work, we introduce surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) as a novel, plug-and-play regularizer for deep architectures. SUGAR preserves the standard ReLU function during the forward pass but replaces its derivative in the backward pass with a smooth surrogate that avoids zeroing out gradients. We demonstrate that SUGAR, when paired with a well-chosen surrogate function, substantially enhances generalization performance over convolutional network architectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-18, providing sparser activations while effectively resurrecting dead ReLUs. Moreover, we show that even in modern architectures like Conv2NeXt and Swin Transformer - which typically employ GELU - substituting these with SUGAR yields competitive and even slightly superior performance. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that advanced activation functions are necessary for optimal performance. Instead, they suggest that the conventional ReLU, particularly with appropriate gradient handling, can serve as a strong, versatile revived classic across a broad range of deep learning vision models.

<title>Can Test-time Computation Mitigate Memorization Bias in Neural Symbolic Regression?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22081</link>

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover mathematical equations that fit given numerical data. It has been applied in various fields of scientific research, such as producing human-readable expressions that explain physical phenomena. Recently, Neural symbolic regression (NSR) methods that involve Transformers pre-trained on large-scale synthetic datasets have gained attention. While these methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from low performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In this study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization bias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative evaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found that Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data. Additional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the Transformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while verifying their numerical validity. We finally examined if tailoring test-time strategies can lead to reduced memorization bias and better performance. We empirically demonstrate that providing additional information to the model at test time can significantly mitigate memorization bias. On the other hand, we also find that reducing memorization bias does not necessarily correlate with improved performance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of NSR approaches and offer a foundation for designing more robust, generalizable symbolic regression methods.

<title>Inclusive, Differentially Private Federated Learning for Clinical Data</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.

Abstract: Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.

Abstract: Over the past 15 years, hundreds of bias mitigation methods have been proposed in the pursuit of fairness in machine learning (ML). However, algorithmic biases are domain-, task-, and model-specific, leading to a `portability trap': bias mitigation solutions in one context may not be appropriate in another. Thus, a myriad of design choices have to be made when creating a bias mitigation method, such as the formalization of fairness it pursues, and where and how it intervenes in the ML pipeline. This creates challenges in benchmarking and comparing the relative merits of different bias mitigation methods, and limits their uptake by practitioners.
  We propose BiMi Sheets as a portable, uniform guide to document the design choices of any bias mitigation method. This enables researchers and practitioners to quickly learn its main characteristics and to compare with their desiderata. Furthermore, the sheets' structure allow for the creation of a structured database of bias mitigation methods. In order to foster the sheets' adoption, we provide a platform for finding and creating BiMi Sheets at bimisheet.com.

Abstract: A key challenge in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is achieving effective many-agent multi-step coordination in complex environments. In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline auto-regressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works (SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo) covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings. We will make all of our datasets, experimental data, and code available upon publication.

<title>Uncertainty Estimation for Heterophilic Graphs Through the Lens of Information Theory</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22152</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While uncertainty estimation for graphs recently gained traction, most methods rely on homophily and deteriorate in heterophilic settings. We address this by analyzing message passing neural networks from an information-theoretic perspective and developing a suitable analog to data processing inequality to quantify information throughout the model's layers. In contrast to non-graph domains, information about the node-level prediction target can increase with model depth if a node's features are semantically different from its neighbors. Therefore, on heterophilic graphs, the latent embeddings of an MPNN each provide different information about the data distribution - different from homophilic settings. This reveals that considering all node representations simultaneously is a key design principle for epistemic uncertainty estimation on graphs beyond homophily. We empirically confirm this with a simple post-hoc density estimator on the joint node embedding space that provides state-of-the-art uncertainty on heterophilic graphs. At the same time, it matches prior work on homophilic graphs without explicitly exploiting homophily through post-processing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade gradient-based deep learning has revolutionized several applications. However, this rapid advancement has highlighted the need for a deeper theoretical understanding of its limitations. Research has shown that, in many practical learning tasks, the information contained in the gradient is so minimal that gradient-based methods require an exceedingly large number of iterations to achieve success. The informativeness of the gradient is typically measured by its variance with respect to the random selection of a target function from a hypothesis class.
  We use this framework and give a general bound on the variance in terms of a parameter related to the pairwise independence of the target function class and the collision entropy of the input distribution. Our bound scales as $ \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon+e^{-\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{E}_c}) $, where $ \tilde{\mathcal{O}} $ hides factors related to the regularity of the learning model and the loss function, $ \varepsilon $ measures the pairwise independence of the target function class and $\mathcal{E}_c$ is the collision entropy of the input distribution.
  To demonstrate the practical utility of our bound, we apply it to the class of Learning with Errors (LWE) mappings and high-frequency functions. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present experiments to understand better the nature of recent deep learning-based attacks on LWE.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful tool in machine learning and computer vision to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. Meanwhile, its empirical success has encouraged many theoretical studies to reveal the learning mechanisms. However, in the existing theoretical research, the role of data augmentation is still under-exploited, especially the effects of specific augmentation types. To fill in the blank, we for the first time propose an augmentation-aware error bound for self-supervised contrastive learning, showing that the supervised risk is bounded not only by the unsupervised risk, but also explicitly by a trade-off induced by data augmentation. Then, under a novel semantic label assumption, we discuss how certain augmentation methods affect the error bound. Lastly, we conduct both pixel- and representation-level experiments to verify our proposed theoretical results.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have demonstrated significant success due to their powerful expressiveness, most models struggle to meet practical requirements for uncertainty estimation. Concurrently, the entangled nature of deep neural networks leads to a multifaceted problem, where various localized explanation techniques reveal that multiple unrelated features influence the decisions, thereby undermining interpretability. To address these challenges, we develop a Bayesian Non-negative Decision Layer (BNDL), which reformulates deep neural networks as a conditional Bayesian non-negative factor analysis. By leveraging stochastic latent variables, the BNDL can model complex dependencies and provide robust uncertainty estimation. Moreover, the sparsity and non-negativity of the latent variables encourage the model to learn disentangled representations and decision layers, thereby improving interpretability. We also offer theoretical guarantees that BNDL can achieve effective disentangled learning. In addition, we developed a corresponding variational inference method utilizing a Weibull variational inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate that with enhanced disentanglement capabilities, BNDL not only improves the model's accuracy but also provides reliable uncertainty estimation and improved interpretability.

<title>Pitfalls of Rule- and Model-based Verifiers -- A Case Study on Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Trustworthy verifiers are essential for the success of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR), which is the core methodology behind various large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. In complex domains like mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL training results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct (i.e., false positives). This vulnerability is exploited during policy model optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore the unique risks inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers, aiming to offer valuable insights to develop more robust reward systems in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) are crucial for accelerating computational materials science by surrogating density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Improving their accuracy is possible through pre-training and fine-tuning, where an NNP model is first pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and then fine-tuned on a smaller target dataset. However, this approach is computationally expensive, mainly due to the cost of DFT-based dataset labeling and load imbalances during large-scale pre-training. To address this, we propose LaMM, a semi-supervised pre-training method incorporating improved denoising self-supervised learning and a load-balancing algorithm for efficient multi-node training. We demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages a large-scale dataset of $\sim$300 million semi-labeled samples to train a single NNP model, resulting in improved fine-tuning performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is a fundamental tool for decision-making in a wide range of applications. However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of the optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning (DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy. While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation. In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope. Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this as loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high decision quality.

Abstract: Non-conservative uncertainty bounds are key for both assessing an estimation algorithm's accuracy and in view of downstream tasks, such as its deployment in safety-critical contexts. In this paper, we derive a tight, non-asymptotic uncertainty bound for kernel-based estimation, which can also handle correlated noise sequences. Its computation relies on a mild norm-boundedness assumption on the unknown function and the noise, returning the worst-case function realization within the hypothesis class at an arbitrary query input location. The value of this function is shown to be given in terms of the posterior mean and covariance of a Gaussian process for an optimal choice of the measurement noise covariance. By rigorously analyzing the proposed approach and comparing it with other results in the literature, we show its effectiveness in returning tight and easy-to-compute bounds for kernel-based estimates.

Abstract: Understanding the reasoning behind deep learning model predictions is crucial in cheminformatics and drug discovery, where molecular design determines their properties. However, current evaluation frameworks for Explainable AI (XAI) in this domain often rely on artificial datasets or simplified tasks, employing data-derived metrics that fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios and lack a direct link to explanation faithfulness. To address this, we introduce B-XAIC, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world molecular data and diverse tasks with known ground-truth rationales for assigned labels. Through a comprehensive evaluation using B-XAIC, we reveal limitations of existing XAI methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the molecular domain. This benchmark provides a valuable resource for gaining deeper insights into the faithfulness of XAI, facilitating the development of more reliable and interpretable models.

<title>A Unified Online-Offline Framework for Co-Branding Campaign Recommendations</title>

Abstract: Co-branding has become a vital strategy for businesses aiming to expand market reach within recommendation systems. However, identifying effective cross-industry partnerships remains challenging due to resource imbalances, uncertain brand willingness, and ever-changing market conditions. In this paper, we provide the first systematic study of this problem and propose a unified online-offline framework to enable co-branding recommendations. Our approach begins by constructing a bipartite graph linking ``initiating'' and ``target'' brands to quantify co-branding probabilities and assess market benefits. During the online learning phase, we dynamically update the graph in response to market feedback, while striking a balance between exploring new collaborations for long-term gains and exploiting established partnerships for immediate benefits. To address the high initial co-branding costs, our framework mitigates redundant exploration, thereby enhancing short-term performance while ensuring sustainable strategic growth. In the offline optimization phase, our framework consolidates the interests of multiple sub-brands under the same parent brand to maximize overall returns, avoid excessive investment in single sub-brands, and reduce unnecessary costs associated with over-prioritizing a single sub-brand. We present a theoretical analysis of our approach, establishing a highly nontrivial sublinear regret bound for online learning in the complex co-branding problem, and enhancing the approximation guarantee for the NP-hard offline budget allocation optimization. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world co-branding datasets demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our framework, with at least 12\% improvement.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated significant promise in interpreting the hidden states of language models by decomposing them into interpretable latent directions. However, training SAEs at scale remains challenging, especially when large dictionary sizes are used. While decoders can leverage sparse-aware kernels for efficiency, encoders still require computationally intensive linear operations with large output dimensions. To address this, we propose KronSAE, a novel architecture that factorizes the latent representation via Kronecker product decomposition, drastically reducing memory and computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce mAND, a differentiable activation function approximating the binary AND operation, which improves interpretability and performance in our factorized framework.

<title>Revisiting Group Relative Policy Optimization: Insights into On-Policy and Off-Policy Training</title>

arXiv:2505.22257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in both on-policy and off-policy optimization regimes. Our motivation comes from recent work on off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which improves training stability, sampling efficiency, and memory usage. In addition, a recent analysis of GRPO suggests that estimating the advantage function with off-policy samples could be beneficial. Building on these observations, we adapt GRPO to the off-policy setting. We show that both on-policy and off-policy GRPO objectives yield an improvement in the reward. This result motivates the use of clipped surrogate objectives in the off-policy version of GRPO. We then compare the empirical performance of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in post-training using both GRPO variants. Our results show that off-policy GRPO either significantly outperforms or performs on par with its on-policy counterpart.

Abstract: Novel techniques in evolutionary optimization, simulation and machine learning allow for a broad analysis of domains like fluid dynamics, in which computation is expensive and flow behavior is complex. Under the term of full domain analysis we understand the ability to efficiently determine the full space of solutions in a problem domain, and analyze the behavior of those solutions in an accessible and interactive manner. The goal of full domain analysis is to deepen our understanding of domains by generating many examples of flow, their diversification, optimization and analysis. We define a formal model for full domain analysis, its current state of the art, and requirements of subcomponents. Finally, an example is given to show what we can learn by using full domain analysis. Full domain analysis, rooted in optimization and machine learning, can be a helpful tool in understanding complex systems in computational physics and beyond.

Abstract: Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system. However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.

<title>Transformers Pretrained on Procedural Data Contain Modular Structures for Algorithmic Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22308</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining on large, semantically rich datasets is key for developing language models. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that even synthetic data, generated procedurally through simple semantic-free algorithms, can yield some of the same benefits as natural language pretraining. It is unclear what specific capabilities such simple synthetic data instils in a model, where these capabilities reside in the architecture, and how they manifest within its weights. In this short paper, we identify several beneficial forms of procedural data, together with specific algorithmic reasoning skills that improve in small transformers. Our core finding is that different procedural rules instil distinct but complementary inductive structures in the model. With extensive ablations and partial-transfer experiments, we discover that these structures reside in different parts of the model. Attention layers often carry the most transferable information, but some pretraining rules impart useful structure to MLP blocks instead. Most interestingly, the structures induced by multiple rules can be composed to jointly reinforce multiple capabilities. These results suggest an exciting possibility of disentangling the acquisition of knowledge from reasoning in language models, with the goal of improving their robustness and data efficiency.

Abstract: Recent unlearning methods for LLMs are vulnerable to relearning attacks: knowledge believed-to-be-unlearned re-emerges by fine-tuning on a small set of (even seemingly-unrelated) examples. We study this phenomenon in a controlled setting for example-level unlearning in vision classifiers. We make the surprising discovery that forget-set accuracy can recover from around 50% post-unlearning to nearly 100% with fine-tuning on just the retain set -- i.e., zero examples of the forget set. We observe this effect across a wide variety of unlearning methods, whereas for a model retrained from scratch excluding the forget set (gold standard), the accuracy remains at 50%. We observe that resistance to relearning attacks can be predicted by weight-space properties, specifically, $L_2$-distance and linear mode connectivity between the original and the unlearned model. Leveraging this insight, we propose a new class of methods that achieve state-of-the-art resistance to relearning attacks.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 underscores the significant role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present Skywork-OR1, an effective and scalable RL implementation for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models. Building on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series, our RL approach achieves notable performance gains, increasing average accuracy across AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench from 57.8% to 72.8% (+15.0%) for the 32B model and from 43.6% to 57.5% (+13.9%) for the 7B model. Our Skywork-OR1-32B model surpasses both DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on the AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on LiveCodeBench. The Skywork-OR1-7B and Skywork-OR1-Math-7B models demonstrate competitive reasoning capabilities among models of similar size. We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets.

<title>Rethinking BPS: A Utility-Based Evaluation Framework</title>

arXiv:2505.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business process simulation (BPS) is a key tool for analyzing and optimizing organizational workflows, supporting decision-making by estimating the impact of process changes. The reliability of such estimates depends on the ability of a BPS model to accurately mimic the process under analysis, making rigorous accuracy evaluation essential. However, the state-of-the-art approach to evaluating BPS models has two key limitations. First, it treats simulation as a forecasting problem, testing whether models can predict unseen future events. This fails to assess how well a model captures the as-is process, particularly when process behavior changes from train to test period. Thus, it becomes difficult to determine whether poor results stem from an inaccurate model or the inherent complexity of the data, such as unpredictable drift. Second, the evaluation approach strongly relies on Earth Mover's Distance-based metrics, which can obscure temporal patterns and thus yield misleading conclusions about simulation quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that evaluates simulation quality based on its ability to generate representative process behavior. Instead of comparing simulated logs to future real-world executions, we evaluate whether predictive process monitoring models trained on simulated data perform comparably to those trained on real data for downstream analysis tasks. Empirical results show that our framework not only helps identify sources of discrepancies but also distinguishes between model accuracy and data complexity, offering a more meaningful way to assess BPS quality.

<title>A Closer Look on Memorization in Tabular Diffusion Model: A Data-Centric Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating high-quality tabular data, but they carry privacy risks by reproducing exact training samples. While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce memorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most. We present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular diffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how many generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance ratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of memorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately to leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we divide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their training-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and monitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized slightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these insights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method: (a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and (c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and models, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity and downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses. Furthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked samples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective for reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods achieve performance comparable to Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) while requiring significantly fewer computing resources, making it the go-to choice for researchers. We find that although PEFT can achieve competitive results on some benchmarks, its performance falls short of FFT in complex tasks, such as reasoning and instruction-based fine-tuning. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of PEFT and FFT in terms of representational capacity and robustness based on optimization theory. We theoretically demonstrate that PEFT is a strict subset of FFT. By providing theoretical upper bounds for PEFT, we show that the limited parameter space constrains the model's representational ability, making it more susceptible to perturbations. Experiments on 15 datasets encompassing classification, generation, reasoning, instruction fine-tuning tasks and 11 adversarial test sets validate our theories. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established PEFT. The source code is in the anonymous Github repository\footnote{https://github.com/misonsky/PEFTEval}.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in safety-critical domains poses a key challenge: ensuring reliable model performance on downstream user data without access to ground truth labels for direct validation. We propose the suitability filter, a novel framework designed to detect performance deterioration by utilizing suitability signals -- model output features that are sensitive to covariate shifts and indicative of potential prediction errors. The suitability filter evaluates whether classifier accuracy on unlabeled user data shows significant degradation compared to the accuracy measured on the labeled test dataset. Specifically, it ensures that this degradation does not exceed a pre-specified margin, which represents the maximum acceptable drop in accuracy. To achieve reliable performance evaluation, we aggregate suitability signals for both test and user data and compare these empirical distributions using statistical hypothesis testing, thus providing insights into decision uncertainty. Our modular method adapts to various models and domains. Empirical evaluations across different classification tasks demonstrate that the suitability filter reliably detects performance deviations due to covariate shift. This enables proactive mitigation of potential failures in high-stakes applications.

<title>Budget-Adaptive Adapter Tuning in Orthogonal Subspaces for Continual Learning in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22358</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment. To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark.

arXiv:2505.22359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalization performance of unregularized gradient methods for separable linear classification. While previous work mostly deal with the binary case, we focus on the multiclass setting with $k$ classes and establish novel population risk bounds for Gradient Descent for loss functions that decay to zero. In this setting, we show risk bounds that reveal that convergence rates are crucially influenced by the geometry of the loss template, as formalized by Wang and Scott (2024), rather than of the loss function itself. Particularly, we establish risk upper bounds that holds for any decay rate of the loss whose template is smooth with respect to the $p$-norm. In the case of exponentially decaying losses, our results indicates a contrast between the $p=\infty$ case, where the risk exhibits a logarithmic dependence on $k$, and $p=2$ where the risk scales linearly with $k$. To establish this separation formally, we also prove a lower bound in the latter scenario, demonstrating that the polynomial dependence on $k$ is unavoidable. Central to our analysis is a novel bound on the Rademacher complexity of low-noise vector-valued linear predictors with a loss template smooth w.r.t.~general $p$-norms.

Abstract: This paper studies a bandit optimization problem where the goal is to maximize a function $f(x)$ over $T$ periods for some unknown strongly concave function $f$. We consider a new pairwise comparison oracle, where the decision-maker chooses a pair of actions $(x, x')$ for a consecutive number of periods and then obtains an estimate of $f(x)-f(x')$. We show that such a pairwise comparison oracle finds important applications to joint pricing and inventory replenishment problems and network revenue management. The challenge in this bandit optimization is twofold. First, the decision-maker not only needs to determine a pair of actions $(x, x')$ but also a stopping time $n$ (i.e., the number of queries based on $(x, x')$). Second, motivated by our inventory application, the estimate of the difference $f(x)-f(x')$ is biased, which is different from existing oracles in stochastic optimization literature. To address these challenges, we first introduce a discretization technique and local polynomial approximation to relate this problem to linear bandits. Then we developed a tournament successive elimination technique to localize the discretized cell and run an interactive batched version of LinUCB algorithm on cells. We establish regret bounds that are optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we apply our proposed algorithm and analytical framework to the two operations management problems and obtain results that improve state-of-the-art results in the existing literature.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various learning tasks on graph-structured data. Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to 15.07% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers, providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph structures.

Abstract: Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks, and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a critical tool for analyzing and improving organizational processes by estimating the impact of process changes. A key component of BPS is the case-arrival model, which determines the pattern of new case entries into a process. Although accurate case-arrival modeling is essential for reliable simulations, as it influences waiting and overall cycle times, existing approaches often rely on oversimplified static distributions of inter-arrival times. These approaches fail to capture the dynamic and temporal complexities inherent in organizational environments, leading to less accurate and reliable outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose Auto Time Kernel Density Estimation (AT-KDE), a divide-and-conquer approach that models arrival times of processes by incorporating global dynamics, day-of-week variations, and intraday distributional changes, ensuring both precision and scalability. Experiments conducted across 20 diverse processes demonstrate that AT-KDE is far more accurate and robust than existing approaches while maintaining sensible execution time efficiency.

<title>Train with Perturbation, Infer after Merging: A Two-Stage Framework for Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&amp;M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&amp;M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&amp;M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages, including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems, particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, diffusion models only access noisy data $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are typically applied to the expectation of clean samples $\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}_0|\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints into diffusion models.

<title>Mitigating Overthinking in Large Reasoning Models via Manifold Steering</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks.

Abstract: The construction of confidence intervals for the mean of a bounded random variable is a classical problem in statistics with numerous applications in machine learning and virtually all scientific fields. In particular, obtaining the tightest possible confidence intervals is vital every time the sampling of the random variables is expensive. The current state-of-the-art method to construct confidence intervals is by using betting algorithms. This is a very successful approach for deriving optimal confidence sequences, even matching the rate of law of iterated logarithms. However, in the fixed horizon setting, these approaches are either sub-optimal or based on heuristic solutions with strong empirical performance but without a finite-time guarantee. Hence, no betting-based algorithm guaranteeing the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2\log\frac1\delta}{n}})$ width of the confidence intervals are known. This work bridges this gap. We propose a betting-based algorithm to compute confidence intervals that empirically outperforms the competitors. Our betting strategy uses the optimal strategy in every step (in a certain sense), whereas the standard betting methods choose a constant strategy in advance. Leveraging this fact results in strict improvements even for classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones of Hoeffding or Bernstein. Moreover, we also prove that the width of our confidence intervals is optimal up to an $1+o(1)$ factor diminishing with $n$. The code is available on~https://github.com/vvoracek/STaR-bets-confidence-interval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advances in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain bottlenecked by two core challenges: architectural inefficiency due to reliance on Transformers, and a lack of structured fine-tuning for high-difficulty domains. We introduce \ourmodel, an attention-free language model that addresses both issues through architectural and data-centric innovations. Built on the state space dual (SSD) layers of Mamba-2, our model eliminates the need for self-attention and key-value caching, enabling fixed-memory, constant-time inference. To train it for complex reasoning, we propose a two-phase curriculum fine-tuning strategy based on the \textsc{PromptCoT} synthesis paradigm, which generates pedagogically structured problems via abstract concept selection and rationale-guided generation. On benchmark evaluations, \ourmodel-7B outperforms strong Transformer and hybrid models of comparable scale, and even surpasses the much larger Gemma3-27B by 2.6\% on AIME 24, 0.6\% on AIME 25, and 3.0\% on Livecodebench. These results highlight the potential of state space models as efficient and scalable alternatives to attention-based architectures for high-capacity reasoning.

<title>Data-Driven Antenna Miniaturization: A Knowledge-Based System Integrating Quantum PSO and Predictive Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless technologies necessitates automated design frameworks to address antenna miniaturization and performance optimization within constrained development cycles. This study demonstrates a machine learning enhanced workflow integrating Quantum-Behaved Dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (QDPSO) with ANSYS HFSS simulations to accelerate antenna design. The QDPSO algorithm autonomously optimized loop dimensions in 11.53 seconds, achieving a resonance frequency of 1.4208 GHz a 12.7 percent reduction compared to conventional 1.60 GHz designs. Machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Stacked ensembles) predicted resonance frequencies in 0.75 seconds using 936 simulation datasets, with stacked models showing superior training accuracy (R2=0.9825) and SVM demonstrating optimal validation performance (R2=0.7197). The complete design cycle, encompassing optimization, prediction, and ANSYS validation, required 12.42 minutes on standard desktop hardware (Intel i5-8500, 16GB RAM), contrasting sharply with the 50-hour benchmark of PSADEA-based approaches. This 240 times of acceleration eliminates traditional trial-and-error methods that often extend beyond seven expert-led days. The system enables precise specifications of performance targets with automated generation of fabrication-ready parameters, particularly benefiting compact consumer devices requiring rapid frequency tuning. By bridging AI-driven optimization with CAD validation, this framework reduces engineering workloads while ensuring production-ready designs, establishing a scalable paradigm for next-generation RF systems in 6G and IoT applications.

<title>SOReL and TOReL: Two Methods for Fully Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22442</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample efficiency remains a major obstacle for real world adoption of reinforcement learning (RL): success has been limited to settings where simulators provide access to essentially unlimited environment interactions, which in reality are typically costly or dangerous to obtain. Offline RL in principle offers a solution by exploiting offline data to learn a near-optimal policy before deployment. In practice, however, current offline RL methods rely on extensive online interactions for hyperparameter tuning, and have no reliable bound on their initial online performance. To address these two issues, we introduce two algorithms. Firstly, SOReL: an algorithm for safe offline reinforcement learning. Using only offline data, our Bayesian approach infers a posterior over environment dynamics to obtain a reliable estimate of the online performance via the posterior predictive uncertainty. Crucially, all hyperparameters are also tuned fully offline. Secondly, we introduce TOReL: a tuning for offline reinforcement learning algorithm that extends our information rate based offline hyperparameter tuning methods to general offline RL approaches. Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately estimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter tuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter tuning methods using only offline data. Thus, SOReL and TOReL make a significant step towards safe and reliable offline RL, unlocking the potential for RL in the real world. Our implementations are publicly available: https://github.com/CWibault/sorel\_torel.

<title>Position: All Current Generative Fidelity and Diversity Metrics are Flawed</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any method's development and practical application is limited by our ability to measure its reliability. The popularity of generative modeling emphasizes the importance of good synthetic data metrics. Unfortunately, previous works have found many failure cases in current metrics, for example lack of outlier robustness and unclear lower and upper bounds. We propose a list of desiderata for synthetic data metrics, and a suite of sanity checks: carefully chosen simple experiments that aim to detect specific and known generative modeling failure modes. Based on these desiderata and the results of our checks, we arrive at our position: all current generative fidelity and diversity metrics are flawed. This significantly hinders practical use of synthetic data. Our aim is to convince the research community to spend more effort in developing metrics, instead of models. Additionally, through analyzing how current metrics fail, we provide practitioners with guidelines on how these metrics should (not) be used.

Abstract: We study pure exploration problems where the set of correct answers is possibly infinite, e.g., the regression of any continuous function of the means of the bandit. We derive an instance-dependent lower bound for these problems. By analyzing it, we discuss why existing methods (i.e., Sticky Track-and-Stop) for finite answer problems fail at being asymptotically optimal in this more general setting. Finally, we present a framework, Sticky-Sequence Track-and-Stop, which generalizes both Track-and-Stop and Sticky Track-and-Stop, and that enjoys asymptotic optimality. Due to its generality, our analysis also highlights special cases where existing methods enjoy optimality.

arXiv:2505.22474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forecasting of multivariate urban data presents a complex challenge due to the intricate dependencies between various urban metrics such as weather, air pollution, carbon intensity, and energy demand. This paper introduces a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that utilizes advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture spatial dependencies among different time-series variables. The proposed model incorporates a decomposition-based preprocessing step, isolating trend, seasonal, and residual components to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of forecasts. By leveraging the dynamic capabilities of GNNs, the model effectively captures interdependencies and improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including electricity usage, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across various forecasting scenarios. The results highlight the potential of the model to optimize smart infrastructure systems, contributing to energy-efficient urban development and enhanced public well-being.

arXiv:2505.22475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pure exploration problems, a statistician sequentially collects information to answer a question about some stochastic and unknown environment. The probability of returning a wrong answer should not exceed a maximum risk parameter $\delta$ and good algorithms make as few queries to the environment as possible. The Track-and-Stop algorithm is a pioneering method to solve these problems. Specifically, it is well-known that it enjoys asymptotic optimality sample complexity guarantees for $\delta\to 0$ whenever the map from the environment to its correct answers is single-valued (e.g., best-arm identification with a unique optimal arm). The Sticky Track-and-Stop algorithm extends these results to settings where, for each environment, there might exist multiple correct answers (e.g., $\epsilon$-optimal arm identification). Although both methods are optimal in the asymptotic regime, their non-asymptotic guarantees remain unknown. In this work, we fill this gap and provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both algorithms.

<title>A Closer Look at Multimodal Representation Collapse</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page: https://abhrac.github.io/mmcollapse/.

arXiv:2505.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at using Energy-based Model (EBM) framework to better understand adversarial training (AT) in classifiers, and additionally to analyze the intrinsic generative capabilities of robust classifiers. By viewing standard classifiers through an energy lens, we begin by analyzing how the energies of adversarial examples, generated by various attacks, differ from those of the natural samples. The central focus of our work is to understand the critical phenomena of Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust Overfitting (RO) in AT from an energy perspective. We analyze the impact of existing AT approaches on the energy of samples during training and observe that the behavior of the ``delta energy' -- change in energy between original sample and its adversarial counterpart -- diverges significantly when CO or RO occurs. After a thorough analysis of these energy dynamics and their relationship with overfitting, we propose a novel regularizer, the Delta Energy Regularizer (DER), designed to smoothen the energy landscape during training. We demonstrate that DER is effective in mitigating both CO and RO across multiple benchmarks. We further show that robust classifiers, when being used as generative models, have limits in handling trade-off between image quality and variability. We propose an improved technique based on a local class-wise principal component analysis (PCA) and energy-based guidance for better class-specific initialization and adaptive stopping, enhancing sample diversity and generation quality. Considering that we do not explicitly train for generative modeling, we achieve a competitive Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) compared to hybrid discriminative-generative models.

<title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Large Learning Rates under Standard Width Scaling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22491</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22491</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is He initialization and a single global learning rate (\textit{standard parameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing infinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and vanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically optimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically predicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we demonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width phenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and incoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be fundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an intermediate \textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits diverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training under large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all hidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments across optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities (vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for predicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise learning rate scalings for standard initialization.

<title>Demystifying the Paradox of Importance Sampling with an Estimated History-Dependent Behavior Policy in Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22492</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22492</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning with a focus on behavior policy estimation for importance sampling. Prior work has shown empirically that estimating a history-dependent behavior policy can lead to lower mean squared error (MSE) even when the true behavior policy is Markovian. However, the question of why the use of history should lower MSE remains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by deriving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance sampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy estimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their finite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions on a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these findings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS estimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with the behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.

arXiv:2505.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing protein sequences of both high fitness and novelty is a challenging task in data-efficient protein engineering. Exploration beyond wild-type neighborhoods often leads to biologically implausible sequences or relies on surrogate models that lose fidelity in novel regions. Here, we propose ProSpero, an active learning framework in which a frozen pre-trained generative model is guided by a surrogate updated from oracle feedback. By integrating fitness-relevant residue selection with biologically-constrained Sequential Monte Carlo sampling, our approach enables exploration beyond wild-type neighborhoods while preserving biological plausibility. We show that our framework remains effective even when the surrogate is misspecified. ProSpero consistently outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse protein engineering tasks, retrieving sequences of both high fitness and novelty.

Abstract: Nuclear physics experiments are aimed at uncovering the fundamental building blocks of matter. The experiments involve high-energy collisions that produce complex events with many particle trajectories. Tracking charged particles resulting from collisions in the presence of a strong magnetic field is critical to enable the reconstruction of particle trajectories and precise determination of interactions. It is traditionally achieved through combinatorial approaches that scale worse than linearly as the number of hits grows. Since particle hit data naturally form a 3-dimensional point cloud and can be structured as graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge as an intuitive and effective choice for this task. In this study, we evaluate the GNN model for track finding on the data from the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab. We use simulation data to train the model and test on both simulation and real GlueX measurements. We demonstrate that GNN-based track finding outperforms the currently used traditional method at GlueX in terms of segment-based efficiency at a fixed purity while providing faster inferences. We show that the GNN model can achieve significant speedup by processing multiple events in batches, which exploits the parallel computation capability of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Finally, we compare the GNN implementation on GPU and FPGA and describe the trade-off.

arXiv:2505.22506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a predominant tool in mechanistic interpretability, aiming to identify interpretable monosemantic features. However, how does sparse encoding organize the representations of activation vector from language models? What is the relationship between this organizational paradigm and feature disentanglement as well as reconstruction performance? To address these questions, we propose the SAEMA, which validates the stratified structure of the representation by observing the variability of the rank of the symmetric semipositive definite (SSPD) matrix corresponding to the modal tensor unfolded along the latent tensor with the level of noise added to the residual stream. To systematically investigate how sparse encoding alters representational structures, we define local and global representations, demonstrating that they amplify inter-feature distinctions by merging similar semantic features and introducing additional dimensionality. Furthermore, we intervene the global representation from an optimization perspective, proving a significant causal relationship between their separability and the reconstruction performance. This study explains the principles of sparsity from the perspective of representational geometry and demonstrates the impact of changes in representational structure on reconstruction performance. Particularly emphasizes the necessity of understanding representations and incorporating representational constraints, providing empirical references for developing new interpretable tools and improving SAEs.

<title>Accelerating Optimization via Differentiable Stopping Time</title>

arXiv:2505.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization is an important module of modern machine learning applications. Tremendous efforts have been made to accelerate optimization algorithms. A common formulation is achieving a lower loss at a given time. This enables a differentiable framework with respect to the algorithm hyperparameters. In contrast, its dual, minimizing the time to reach a target loss, is believed to be non-differentiable, as the time is not differentiable. As a result, it usually serves as a conceptual framework or is optimized using zeroth-order methods. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable stopping time and theoretically justify it based on differential equations. An efficient algorithm is designed to backpropagate through it. As a result, the proposed differentiable stopping time enables a new differentiable formulation for accelerating algorithms. We further discuss its applications, such as online hyperparameter tuning and learning to optimize. Our proposed methods show superior performance in comprehensive experiments across various problems, which confirms their effectiveness.

<title>Evaluating Supervised Learning Models for Fraud Detection: A Comparative Study of Classical and Deep Architectures on Imbalanced Transaction Data</title>

arXiv:2505.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset. While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision, highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and operational needs of fraud detection systems.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have become highly effective across various domains. However, real-world applications often require the generative process to adhere to certain constraints but without task-specific fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a training-free method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution at the test time. Our approach leverages twisted SMC with an approximate locally optimal proposal, obtained via a first-order Taylor expansion of the reward function. To address the challenge of ill-defined gradients in discrete spaces, we incorporate a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, enabling efficient gradient-based approximation within the discrete generative framework. Empirical results on both synthetic datasets and image modelling validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization. However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL, applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we propose in our work.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum generative model for synthesizing tabular data. Synthetic data is valuable in scenarios where real-world data is scarce or private, it can be used to augment or replace existing datasets. Real-world enterprise data is predominantly tabular and heterogeneous, often comprising a mixture of categorical and numerical features, making it highly relevant across various industries such as healthcare, finance, and software. We propose a quantum generative adversarial network architecture with flexible data encoding and a novel quantum circuit ansatz to effectively model tabular data. The proposed approach is tested on the MIMIC III healthcare and Adult Census datasets, with extensive benchmarking against leading classical models, CTGAN, and CopulaGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our quantum model outperforms classical models by an average of 8.5% with respect to an overall similarity score from SDMetrics, while using only 0.072% of the parameters of the classical models. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of the models using two custom-designed metrics that demonstrate the ability of the proposed quantum model to generate useful and novel samples. To our knowledge, this is one of the first demonstrations of a successful quantum generative model for handling tabular data, indicating that this task could be well-suited to quantum computers.

<title>Uncertainty Quantification with Proper Scoring Rules: Adjusting Measures to Prediction Tasks</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty quantification and propose measures of total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on a known decomposition of (strictly) proper scoring rules, a specific type of loss function, into a divergence and an entropy component. This leads to a flexible framework for uncertainty quantification that can be instantiated with different losses (scoring rules), which makes it possible to tailor uncertainty quantification to the use case at hand. We show that this flexibility is indeed advantageous. In particular, we analyze the task of selective prediction and show that the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. In addition, we perform experiments on two other common tasks. For out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, mutual information, performs best. Moreover, in the setting of active learning, our measure of epistemic uncertainty based on the zero-one-loss consistently outperforms other uncertainty measures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks form the backbone of artificial intelligence research, with potential to transform the human experience in areas ranging from autonomous driving to personal assistants, healthcare to education. However, their integration into the daily routines of real-world classrooms remains limited. It is not yet common for a teacher to assign students individualized homework targeting their specific weaknesses, provide students with instant feedback, or simulate student responses to a new exam question. While these models excel in predictive performance, this lack of adoption can be attributed to a significant weakness: the lack of explainability of model decisions, leading to a lack of trust from students, parents, and teachers. This thesis aims to bring human needs to the forefront of eXplainable AI (XAI) research, grounded in the concrete use case of personalized learning and teaching. We frame the contributions along two verticals: technical advances in XAI and their aligned human studies. We investigate explainability in AI for education, revealing systematic disagreements between post-hoc explainers and identifying a need for inherently interpretable model architectures. We propose four novel technical contributions in interpretability with a multimodal modular architecture (MultiModN), an interpretable mixture-of-experts model (InterpretCC), adversarial training for explainer stability, and a theory-driven LLM-XAI framework to present explanations to students (iLLuMinaTE), which we evaluate in diverse settings with professors, teachers, learning scientists, and university students. By combining empirical evaluations of existing explainers with novel architectural designs and human studies, our work lays a foundation for human-centric AI systems that balance state-of-the-art performance with built-in transparency and trust.

Abstract: Scaling foundation model training with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) methods is bandwidth-limited. Existing infrequent communication methods like Local SGD were designed to synchronize only model parameters and cannot be trivially applied to adaptive optimizers due to additional optimizer states. Current approaches extending Local SGD either lack convergence guarantees or require synchronizing all optimizer states, tripling communication costs. We propose Desynced Low Communication Adaptive Optimizers (DES-LOC), a family of optimizers assigning independent synchronization periods to parameters and momenta, enabling lower communication costs while preserving convergence. Through extensive experiments on language models of up to 1.7B, we show that DES-LOC can communicate 170x less than DDP and 2x less than the previous state-of-the-art Local ADAM. Furthermore, unlike previous heuristic approaches, DES-LOC is suited for practical training scenarios prone to system failures. DES-LOC offers a scalable, bandwidth-efficient, and fault-tolerant solution for foundation model training.

Abstract: Processing global geometric context while preserving equivariance is crucial when modeling biological, chemical, and physical systems. Yet, this is challenging due to the computational demands of equivariance and global context at scale. Standard methods such as equivariant self-attention suffer from quadratic complexity, while local methods such as distance-based message passing sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of state-space and long-convolutional models, we introduce Geometric Hyena, the first equivariant long-convolutional model for geometric systems. Geometric Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on all-atom property prediction of large RNA molecules and full protein molecular dynamics, Geometric Hyena outperforms existing equivariant models while requiring significantly less memory and compute that equivariant self-attention. Notably, our model processes the geometric context of 30k tokens 20x faster than the equivariant transformer and allows 72x longer context within the same budget.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is an established approach for performing Bayesian inference on scientific simulators. SBI so far works best on low-dimensional parametric models. However, it is difficult to infer function-valued parameters, which frequently occur in disciplines that model spatiotemporal processes such as the climate and earth sciences. Here, we introduce an approach for efficient posterior estimation, using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) architecture with a flow matching objective. We show that our approach, FNOPE, can perform inference of function-valued parameters at a fraction of the simulation budget of state of the art methods. In addition, FNOPE supports posterior evaluation at arbitrary discretizations of the domain, as well as simultaneous estimation of vector-valued parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark tasks and a challenging spatial inference task from glaciology. FNOPE extends the applicability of SBI methods to new scientific domains by enabling the inference of function-valued parameters.

<title>Benignity of loss landscape with weight decay requires both large overparametrization and initialization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22578</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.22578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of neural networks under weight decay remains poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint. While weight decay is standard practice in modern training procedures, most theoretical analyses focus on unregularized settings. In this work, we investigate the loss landscape of the $\ell_2$-regularized training loss for two-layer ReLU networks. We show that the landscape becomes benign -- i.e., free of spurious local minima -- under large overparametrization, specifically when the network width $m$ satisfies $m \gtrsim \min(n^d, 2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $d$ the input dimension. More precisely in this regime, almost all constant activation regions contain a global minimum and no spurious local minima. We further show that this level of overparametrization is not only sufficient but also necessary via the example of orthogonal data. Finally, we demonstrate that such loss landscape results primarily hold relevance in the large initialization regime. In contrast, for small initializations -- corresponding to the feature learning regime -- optimization can still converge to spurious local minima, despite the global benignity of the landscape.

<title>Machine Unlearning under Overparameterization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the influence of specific training samples, ideally recovering the model that would have resulted from training on the remaining data alone. We study unlearning in the overparameterized setting, where many models interpolate the data, and defining the unlearning solution as any loss minimizer over the retained set$\unicode{x2013}$as in prior work in the underparameterized setting$\unicode{x2013}$is inadequate, since the original model may already interpolate the retained data and satisfy this condition. In this regime, loss gradients vanish, rendering prior methods based on gradient perturbations ineffective, motivating both new unlearning definitions and algorithms. For this setting, we define the unlearning solution as the minimum-complexity interpolator over the retained data and propose a new algorithmic framework that only requires access to model gradients on the retained set at the original solution. We minimize a regularized objective over perturbations constrained to be orthogonal to these model gradients, a first-order relaxation of the interpolation condition. For different model classes, we provide exact and approximate unlearning guarantees, and we demonstrate that an implementation of our framework outperforms existing baselines across various unlearning experiments.

Abstract: Sequential learning -- where complex tasks are broken down into simpler, hierarchical components -- has emerged as a paradigm in AI. This paper views sequential learning through the lens of low-rank linear regression, focusing specifically on how errors propagate when learning rank-1 subspaces sequentially. We present an analysis framework that decomposes the learning process into a series of rank-1 estimation problems, where each subsequent estimation depends on the accuracy of previous steps. Our contribution is a characterization of the error propagation in this sequential process, establishing bounds on how errors -- e.g., due to limited computational budgets and finite precision -- affect the overall model accuracy. We prove that these errors compound in predictable ways, with implications for both algorithmic design and stability guarantees.

<title>The Entropy Mechanism of Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning Language Models</title>

Abstract: This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0, R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically. Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens. Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream performance.

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method to control language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although steering demonstrates promising performance, recent work shows that it can be unreliable or even counterproductive in some cases. This paper studies the influence of prompt types and the geometry of activation differences on steering reliability. First, we find that all seven prompt types used in our experiments produce a net positive steering effect, but exhibit high variance across samples, and often give an effect opposite of the desired one. No prompt type clearly outperforms the others, and yet the steering vectors resulting from the different prompt types often differ directionally (as measured by cosine similarity). Second, we show that higher cosine similarity between training set activation differences predicts more effective steering. Finally, we observe that datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated are more steerable. Our results suggest that vector steering is unreliable when the target behavior is not represented by a coherent direction.

Abstract: Survival analysis is widely deployed in a diverse set of fields, including healthcare, business, ecology, etc. The Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is a semi-parametric model often encountered in the literature. Despite its popularity, wide deployment, and numerous variants, scaling CoxPH to large datasets and deep architectures poses a challenge, especially in the high-dimensional regime. We identify a fundamental connection between rank regression and the CoxPH model: this allows us to adapt and extend the so-called spectral method for rank regression to survival analysis. Our approach is versatile, naturally generalizing to several CoxPH variants, including deep models. We empirically verify our method's scalability on multiple real-world high-dimensional datasets; our method outperforms legacy methods w.r.t. predictive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving complex mathematical and logical problems. However, it can often veer off track through incorrect or unsubstantiated inferences. Formal mathematical reasoning, which can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this issue. However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex problems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem statement can be challenging. Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider the problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language Chain-of-Thought reasoning. That is, given a problem statement and step-by-step solution in natural language, the aim of the verifier is to output [Yes] if the reasoning steps in the solution are all valid, and [No] otherwise. In this work we give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose and analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of strength, in this framework. We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for learning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and impossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives without additional assumptions.

<title>Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents</title>

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is limited or unavailable.

Abstract: Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive information in the corpora such as copyrighted, biased, and private content has led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time correction. We propose {\delta}-Unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, {\delta}-Unlearning learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that {\delta}- Unlearning can effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. {\delta}-Unlearning also effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to black-box LLMs.

Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing have spurred significant interest in harnessing its potential for speedups over classical systems. However, noise remains a major obstacle to achieving reliable quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a provably noise-resilient training theory and algorithm to enhance the robustness of parameterized quantum circuit classifiers. Our method, with a natural connection to Evolutionary Strategies, guarantees resilience to parameter noise with minimal adjustments to commonly used optimization algorithms. Our approach is function-agnostic and adaptable to various quantum circuits, successfully demonstrated in quantum phase classification tasks. By developing provably guaranteed optimization theory with quantum circuits, our work opens new avenues for practical, robust applications of near-term quantum computers.

Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.

Abstract: Brain aging trajectories differ between males and females, yet the genetic factors underlying these differences remain underexplored. Using structural MRI and genotyping data from 40,940 UK Biobank participants (aged 45-83), we computed Brain Age Gap Estimates (BrainAGE) for total brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes. We conducted sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and Post-GWAS analyses to identify genetic variants associated with accelerated brain aging. Distinct gene sets emerged by sex: in females, neurotransmitter transport and mitochondrial stress response genes were implicated; in males, immune and inflammation-related genes dominated. Shared genes, including GMNC and OSTN, were consistently linked to brain volumes across sexes, suggesting core roles in neurostructural maintenance. Tissue expression analyses revealed sex-specific enrichment in pathways tied to neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the importance of sex-stratified approaches in aging research and suggest genetic targets for personalized interventions against age-related cognitive decline.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used by physicians for the diagnosis of numerous neurological disorders. Due to the large volume of EEGs requiring interpretation and the specific expertise involved, artificial intelligence-based tools are being developed to assist in their visual analysis. In this paper, we compare two deep learning models (CNN-LSTM and Transformer-based) with BioSerenity-E1, a recently proposed foundation model, in the task of classifying entire EEG recordings as normal or abnormal. The three models were trained or finetuned on 2,500 EEG recordings and their performances were evaluated on two private and one public datasets: a large multicenter dataset annotated by a single specialist (dataset A composed of n = 4,480 recordings), a small multicenter dataset annotated by three specialists (dataset B, n = 198), and the Temple University Abnormal (TUAB) EEG corpus evaluation dataset (n = 276). On dataset A, the three models achieved at least 86% balanced accuracy, with BioSerenity-E1 finetuned achieving the highest balanced accuracy (89.19% [88.36-90.41]). BioSerenity-E1 finetuned also achieved the best performance on dataset B, with 94.63% [92.32-98.12] balanced accuracy. The models were then validated on TUAB evaluation dataset, whose corresponding training set was not used during training, where they achieved at least 76% accuracy. Specifically, BioSerenity-E1 finetuned outperformed the other two models, reaching an accuracy of 82.25% [78.27-87.48]. Our results highlight the usefulness of leveraging pre-trained models for automatic EEG classification: enabling robust and efficient interpretation of EEG data with fewer resources and broader applicability.

Abstract: Machine learning models achieve high precision, but their decision-making processes often lack explainability. Furthermore, as model complexity increases, explainability typically decreases. Existing efforts to improve explainability primarily involve developing new eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques or incorporating explainability constraints during training. While these approaches yield specific improvements, their applicability remains limited. In this work, we propose the Vision Transformer with artificial Astrocytes (ViTA). This training-free approach is inspired by neuroscience and enhances the reasoning of a pretrained deep neural network to generate more human-aligned explanations. We evaluated our approach employing two well-known XAI techniques, Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, and compared it to a standard Vision Transformer (ViT). Using the ClickMe dataset, we quantified the similarity between the heatmaps produced by the XAI techniques and a (human-aligned) ground truth. Our results consistently demonstrate that incorporating artificial astrocytes enhances the alignment of model explanations with human perception, leading to statistically significant improvements across all XAI techniques and metrics utilized.

<title>CIM-NET: A Video Denoising Deep Neural Network Model Optimized for Computing-in-Memory Architectures</title>

Abstract: While deep neural network (DNN)-based video denoising has demonstrated significant performance, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices remains challenging due to stringent real-time and energy efficiency requirements. Computing-in-Memory (CIM) chips offer a promising solution by integrating computation within memory cells, enabling rapid matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). However, existing DNN models are often designed without considering CIM architectural constraints, thus limiting their acceleration potential during inference. To address this, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework incorporating two innovations: (1) a CIM-Aware Architecture, CIM-NET, optimized for large receptive field operation and CIM's crossbar-based MVM acceleration; and (2) a pseudo-convolutional operator, CIM-CONV, used within CIM-NET to integrate slide-based processing with fully connected transformations for high-quality feature extraction and reconstruction. This framework significantly reduces the number of MVM operations, improving inference speed on CIM chips while maintaining competitive performance. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the conventional lightweight model FastDVDnet, CIM-NET substantially reduces MVM operations with a slight decrease in denoising performance. With a stride value of 8, CIM-NET reduces MVM operations to 1/77th of the original, while maintaining competitive PSNR (35.11 dB vs. 35.56 dB

<title>Learning Shared Representations from Unpaired Data</title>

Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data. Our code IS publicly available at https://github.com/shaham-lab/SUE.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridges enable transitions between arbitrary distributions, with the Unified Diffusion Bridge (UniDB) framework achieving high-fidelity image generation via a Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) formulation. However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models. Our code is available at https://github.com/2769433owo/UniDB-plusplus.

Abstract: Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology employed for distance and depth estimation across medical, automotive, and other fields, encounters significant computational challenges in scattering media. The complex nature of the acquired FLiDAR signal, particularly in such environments, makes isolating photon time-of-flight (related to target depth) and intrinsic fluorescence lifetime exceptionally difficult, thus limiting the effectiveness of current analytical and computational methodologies. To overcome this limitation, we present a Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework tailored for specialized modeling of diverse temporal components. In contrast to the conventional MoE approaches our expert models are informed by underlying physics, such as the radiative transport equation governing photon propagation in scattering media. Central to our approach is EvidenceMoE, which integrates Evidence-Based Dirichlet Critics (EDCs). These critic models assess the reliability of each expert's output by providing per-expert quality scores and corrective feedback. A Decider Network then leverages this information to fuse expert predictions into a robust final estimate adaptively. We validate our method using realistically simulated Fluorescence LiDAR (FLiDAR) data for non-invasive cancer cell depth detection generated from photon transport models in tissue. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, achieving a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.030 for depth estimation and 0.074 for fluorescence lifetime.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Self-Organizing Visual Prototypes (SOP), a new training technique for unsupervised visual feature learning. Unlike existing prototypical self-supervised learning (SSL) methods that rely on a single prototype to encode all relevant features of a hidden cluster in the data, we propose the SOP strategy. In this strategy, a prototype is represented by many semantically similar representations, or support embeddings (SEs), each containing a complementary set of features that together better characterize their region in space and maximize training performance. We reaffirm the feasibility of non-parametric SSL by introducing novel non-parametric adaptations of two loss functions that implement the SOP strategy. Notably, we introduce the SOP Masked Image Modeling (SOP-MIM) task, where masked representations are reconstructed from the perspective of multiple non-parametric local SEs. We comprehensively evaluate the representations learned using the SOP strategy on a range of benchmarks, including retrieval, linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and object detection. Our pre-trained encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance on many retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate increasing performance gains with more complex encoders.

<title>Is Attention Required for Transformer Inference? Explore Function-preserving Attention Replacement</title>

Abstract: While transformers excel across vision and language pretraining tasks, their reliance on attention mechanisms poses challenges for inference efficiency, especially on edge and embedded accelerators with limited parallelism and memory bandwidth. Hinted by the observed redundancy of attention at inference time, we hypothesize that though the model learns complicated token dependency through pretraining, the inference-time sequence-to-sequence mapping in each attention layer is actually ''simple'' enough to be represented with a much cheaper function. In this work, we explore FAR, a Function-preserving Attention Replacement framework that replaces all attention blocks in pretrained transformers with learnable sequence-to-sequence modules, exemplified by an LSTM. FAR optimize a multi-head LSTM architecture with a block-wise distillation objective and a global structural pruning framework to achieve a family of efficient LSTM-based models from pretrained transformers. We validate FAR on the DeiT vision transformer family and demonstrate that it matches the accuracy of the original models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with reduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the semantic token relationships and the token-to-token correlation learned in the transformer's attention module.

<title>CiRL: Open-Source Environments for Reinforcement Learning in Circular Economy and Net Zero</title>

Abstract: The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control designs; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is publicly available.

<title>Corruption-Aware Training of Latent Video Diffusion Models for Robust Text-to-Video Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) achieve high-quality generation but are sensitive to imperfect conditioning, which causes semantic drift and temporal incoherence on noisy, web-scale video-text datasets. We introduce CAT-LVDM, the first corruption-aware training framework for LVDMs that improves robustness through structured, data-aligned noise injection. Our method includes Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI), which perturbs embeddings along intra-batch semantic directions to preserve temporal consistency. BCNI is especially effective on caption-rich datasets like WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD. We also propose Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), which injects noise along dominant spectral directions to improve low-frequency smoothness, showing strong results on UCF-101. On average, BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9% across WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN yields a 12.3% improvement on UCF-101. Ablation studies confirm the benefit of low-rank, data-aligned noise. Our theoretical analysis further explains how such perturbations tighten entropy, Wasserstein, score-drift, mixing-time, and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM establishes a principled, scalable training approach for robust video diffusion under multimodal noise. Code and models: https://github.com/chikap421/catlvdm

Abstract: Whisper fails to correctly transcribe dementia speech because persons with dementia (PwDs) often exhibit irregular speech patterns and disfluencies such as pauses, repetitions, and fragmented sentences. It was trained on standard speech and may have had little or no exposure to dementia-affected speech. However, correct transcription is vital for dementia speech for cost-effective diagnosis and the development of assistive technology. In this work, we fine-tune Whisper with the open-source dementia speech dataset (DementiaBank) and our in-house dataset to improve its word error rate (WER). The fine-tuning also includes filler words to ascertain the filler inclusion rate (FIR) and F1 score. The fine-tuned models significantly outperformed the off-the-shelf models. The medium-sized model achieved a WER of 0.24, outperforming previous work. Similarly, there was a notable generalisability to unseen data and speech patterns.

Abstract: We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks, specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the work of Jenner et al. (2024) by analyzing the model's ability to consider future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our findings reveal that the network's look-ahead behavior is highly context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position. We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play. These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains. Our work also showcases the effectiveness of interpretability techniques in uncovering cognitive-like processes in artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Network traffic prediction techniques have attracted much attention since they are valuable for network congestion control and user experience improvement. While existing prediction techniques can achieve favorable performance when there is sufficient training data, it remains a great challenge to make accurate predictions when only a small amount of training data is available. To tackle this problem, we propose a deep learning model, entitled MetaSTNet, based on a multimodal meta-learning framework. It is an end-to-end network architecture that trains the model in a simulator and transfers the meta-knowledge to a real-world environment, which can quickly adapt and obtain accurate predictions on a new task with only a small amount of real-world training data. In addition, we further employ cross conformal prediction to assess the calibrated prediction intervals. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MetaSTNet.

Abstract: Agricultural research has accelerated in recent years, yet farmers often lack the time and resources for on-farm research due to the demands of crop production and farm operations. Seed classification offers valuable insights into quality control, production efficiency, and impurity detection. Early identification of seed types is critical to reducing the cost and risk associated with field emergence, which can lead to yield losses or disruptions in downstream processes like harvesting. Seed sampling supports growers in monitoring and managing seed quality, improving precision in determining seed purity levels, guiding management adjustments, and enhancing yield estimations. This study proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework for the efficient classification of ten common Brassica seed types. The approach addresses the inherent challenge of texture similarity in seed images using a custom-designed CNN architecture. The model's performance was evaluated against several pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures, with adjustments to layer configurations for optimized classification. Experimental results using our collected Brassica seed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieved a high accuracy rate of 93 percent.

Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework for the automated staging of spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) fusion, a critical diagnostic marker in both orthodontics and forensic anthropology. Our approach leverages a dual-model architecture wherein a teacher model, trained on manually cropped images, transfers its precise spatial understanding to a student model that operates on full, uncropped images. This knowledge distillation is facilitated by a newly formulated loss function that aligns spatial logits as well as incorporates gradient-based attention spatial mapping, ensuring that the student model internalizes the anatomically relevant features without relying on external cropping or YOLO-based segmentation. By leveraging expert-curated data and feedback at each step, our framework attains robust diagnostic accuracy, culminating in a clinically viable end-to-end pipeline. This streamlined approach obviates the need for additional pre-processing tools and accelerates deployment, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and consistency of skeletal maturation assessment in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: In deep multi-instance learning, the number of applicable instances depends on the data set. In histopathology images, deep learning multi-instance learners usually assume there are hundreds to thousands instances in a bag. However, when the number of instances in a bag increases to 256 in brain hematoma CT, learning becomes extremely difficult. In this paper, we address this drawback. To overcome this problem, we propose using a pre-trained model with self-supervised learning for the multi-instance learner as a downstream task. With this method, even when the original target task suffers from the spurious correlation problem, we show improvements of 5% to 13% in accuracy and 40% to 55% in the F1 measure for the hypodensity marker classification of brain hematoma CT.

Abstract: AI-based motion capture is an emerging technology that offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However, current AI motion capture methods rely entirely on observed video sequences, similar to conventional motion capture. This means that all human actions must be predefined, and movements outside the observed sequences are not possible. To address this limitation, we aim to apply AI motion capture to virtual humans, where flexible actions beyond the observed sequences are required. We assume that while many action fragments exist in the training data, the transitions between them may be missing. To bridge these gaps, we propose a diffusion-model-based action completion technique that generates complementary human motion sequences, ensuring smooth and continuous movements. By introducing a gate module and a position-time embedding module, our approach achieves competitive results on the Human3.6M dataset. Our experimental results show that (1) MDC-Net outperforms existing methods in ADE, FDE, and MMADE but is slightly less accurate in MMFDE, (2) MDC-Net has a smaller model size (16.84M) compared to HumanMAC (28.40M), and (3) MDC-Net generates more natural and coherent motion sequences. Additionally, we propose a method for extracting sensor data, including acceleration and angular velocity, from human motion sequences.

Abstract: With the development of Embodied Artificial intelligence, the end-to-end control policy such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has become the mainstream. Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment. Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.

Abstract: Mesh-based 3D static analysis methods have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to traditional computational numerical solvers, significantly reducing computational costs and runtime for various physics-based analyses. However, these methods primarily focus on surface topology and geometry, often overlooking the inherent thickness of real-world 3D objects, which exhibits high correlations and similar behavior between opposing surfaces. This limitation arises from the disconnected nature of these surfaces and the absence of internal edge connections within the mesh. In this work, we propose a novel framework, the Thickness-aware E(3)-Equivariant 3D Mesh Neural Network (T-EMNN), that effectively integrates the thickness of 3D objects while maintaining the computational efficiency of surface meshes. Additionally, we introduce data-driven coordinates that encode spatial information while preserving E(3)-equivariance or invariance properties, ensuring consistent and robust analysis. Evaluations on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate the superior performance of T-EMNN in accurately predicting node-level 3D deformations, effectively capturing thickness effects while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts the performance by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT and DenseNet on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, with a range of optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet. It can also easily stack with existing weak and strong augmentation strategies to further boost the performance.

Abstract: Complex data are often represented as a graph, which in turn can often be viewed as a realisation of a random graph, such as of an inhomogeneous random graph model (IRG). For general fast goodness-of-fit tests in high dimensions, kernelised Stein discrepancy (KSD) tests are a powerful tool. Here, we develop, test, and analyse a KSD-type goodness-of-fit test for IRG models that can be carried out with a single observation of the network. The test is applicable to a network of any size and does not depend on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. We also provide theoretical guarantees.

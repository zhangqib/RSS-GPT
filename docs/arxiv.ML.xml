<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces Modality Incremental Learning (MIL), a paradigm that addresses the challenge of incremental learning across evolving modal sequences. The proposed framework, Harmony, utilizes adaptive compatible feature modulation and cumulative modal bridging to align modalities and retain knowledge, allowing the model to learn from a sequence of distinct modalities within a unified framework. By constructing historical modal features and accumulating modal knowledge, the components of Harmony effectively bridge modal differences and maintain knowledge retention, even with only unimodal data available at each learning stage. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving successful learning across multiple modalities in incremental learning scenarios. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously acquire knowledge from evolving data streams while preserving previously learned capabilities. While current research predominantly focuses on unimodal incremental learning and multimodal incremental learning where the modalities are consistent, real-world scenarios often present data from entirely new modalities, posing additional challenges. This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a unified model capable of incremental learning across continuously evolving modal sequences. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm called Modality Incremental Learning (MIL), where each learning stage involves data from distinct modalities. To address this task, we propose a novel framework named Harmony, designed to achieve modal alignment and knowledge retention, enabling the model to reduce the modal discrepancy and learn from a sequence of distinct modalities, ultimately completing tasks across multiple modalities within a unified framework. Our approach introduces the adaptive compatible feature modulation and cumulative modal bridging. Through constructing historical modal features and performing modal knowledge accumulation and alignment, the proposed components collaboratively bridge modal differences and maintain knowledge retention, even with solely unimodal data available at each learning phase.These components work in concert to establish effective modality connections and maintain knowledge retention, even when only unimodal data is available at each learning stage. Extensive experiments on the MIL task demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing incremental learning methods, validating its effectiveness in MIL scenarios.

<div> Keywords: visual AI models, data-efficient scaling laws, distillation boundary theory, knowledge inheritance, vision model scaling behaviors 

Summary: 
This paper introduces a framework for studying the scaling behavior of visual AI models in data-constrained downstream tasks. The authors investigate how data efficiency impacts scaling behaviors and the efficacy of knowledge distillation. They propose the distillation boundary theory, which identifies a critical turning point in distillation efficiency and pre-training dominance based on data availability. In data-scarce conditions, distilled models outperform non-distilled models by leveraging inherited knowledge efficiently. However, as pre-training data increases, non-distilled models gradually surpass distilled models, indicating diminishing returns from knowledge inheritance. The empirical validation across various model scales and data volumes confirms these performance inflection points, highlighting the importance of understanding vision model scaling behaviors in data-limited regimes. This work bridges the gap between large-scale pretraining and practical downstream adaptation, providing insights for optimizing computational resource allocation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current scaling laws for visual AI models focus predominantly on large-scale pretraining, leaving a critical gap in understanding how performance scales for data-constrained downstream tasks. To address this limitation, this paper establishes the first practical framework for data-efficient scaling laws in visual transfer learning, addressing two fundamental questions: 1) How do scaling behaviors shift when downstream tasks operate with limited data? 2) What governs the efficacy of knowledge distillation under such constraints? Through systematic analysis of vision tasks across data regimes (1K-1M samples), we propose the distillation boundary theory, revealing a critical turning point in distillation efficiency: 1) Distillation superiority: In data-scarce conditions, distilled models significantly outperform their non-distillation counterparts, efficiently leveraging inherited knowledge to compensate for limited training samples. 2) Pre-training dominance: As pre-training data increases beyond a critical threshold, non-distilled models gradually surpass distilled versions, suggesting diminishing returns from knowledge inheritance when sufficient task-specific data becomes available. Empirical validation across various model scales (2.5M to 38M parameters) and data volumes demonstrate these performance inflection points, with error difference curves transitioning from positive to negative values at critical data thresholds, confirming our theoretical predictions. This work redefines scaling laws for data-limited regimes, bridging the knowledge gap between large-scale pretraining and practical downstream adaptation, addressing a critical barrier to understanding vision model scaling behaviors and optimizing computational resource allocation.

<div> neural ordinary differential equations, mean-field game theory, deep learning, data-driven, automatic differentiation
<br />
Mean-field game theory has traditionally relied on analytical solutions that may lead to bias and loss of solution characteristics. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines mean-field game theory with deep learning using neural ordinary differential equations. By integrating deep learning, the model becomes data-driven and lightweight, capable of capturing complex strategic interactions beyond traditional mean-field theory. The use of automatic differentiation enhances robustness and objectivity compared to finite difference-based approaches. The study demonstrates the efficacy and flexibility of this method by applying it to three different mean-field games with varying complexities, observabilities, and noise levels. The results showcase the model's adaptability, efficiency, and ability to learn underlying data distributions with minimal observations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field game theory relies on approximating games that would otherwise have been intractable to model. While the games can be solved analytically via the associated system of partial derivatives, this approach is not model-free, can lead to the loss of the existence or uniqueness of solutions and may suffer from modelling bias. To reduce the dependency between the model and the game, we combine mean-field game theory with deep learning in the form of neural ordinary differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven, lightweight and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to capture using mean-field theory alone. In addition, the model is based on automatic differentiation, making it more robust and objective than approaches based on finite differences. We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our approach by solving three mean-field games that vary in their complexity, observability and the presence of noise. Using these results, we show that the model is flexible, lightweight and requires few observations to learn the distribution underlying the data.

arXiv:2504.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polysomnography (PSG) signals are essential for studying sleep processes and diagnosing sleep disorders. Analyzing PSG data through deep neural networks (DNNs) for automated sleep monitoring has become increasingly feasible. However, the limited availability of datasets for certain sleep events often leads to DNNs focusing on a single task with a single-sourced training dataset. As a result, these models struggle to transfer to new sleep events and lack robustness when applied to new datasets. To address these challenges, we propose PSG-MAE, a mask autoencoder (MAE) based pre-training framework. By performing self-supervised learning on a large volume of unlabeled PSG data, PSG-MAE develops a robust feature extraction network that can be broadly applied to various sleep event monitoring tasks. Unlike conventional MAEs, PSG-MAE generates complementary masks across PSG channels, integrates a multichannel signal reconstruction method, and employs a self-supervised inter-channel contrastive learning (ICCL) strategy. This approach enables the encoder to capture temporal features from each channel while simultaneously learning latent relationships between channels, thereby enhancing the utilization of multichannel information. Experimental results show that PSG-MAE effectively captures both temporal details and inter-channel information from PSG signals. When the encoder pre-trained through PSG-MAE is fine-tuned with downstream feature decomposition networks, it achieves an accuracy of 83.7% for sleep staging and 90.45% for detecting obstructive sleep apnea, which highlights the framework's robustness and broad applicability.

Summary: 
- The article introduces a novel autoregressive generative model called Auto-FEDUS for mapping fetal electrocardiogram signals to Doppler ultrasound waveforms.
- Auto-FEDUS utilizes a neural temporal network based on dilated causal convolutions to capture short and long-range dependencies within the signals.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal health monitoring through one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound (DUS) signals offers a cost-effective and accessible approach that is increasingly gaining interest. Despite its potential, the development of machine learning based techniques to assess the health condition of mothers and fetuses using DUS signals remains limited. This scarcity is primarily due to the lack of extensive DUS datasets with a reliable reference for interpretation and data imbalance across different gestational ages. In response, we introduce a novel autoregressive generative model designed to map fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) signals to corresponding DUS waveforms (Auto-FEDUS). By leveraging a neural temporal network based on dilated causal convolutions that operate directly on the waveform level, the model effectively captures both short and long-range dependencies within the signals, preserving the integrity of generated data. Cross-subject experiments demonstrate that Auto-FEDUS outperforms conventional generative architectures across both time and frequency domain evaluations, producing DUS signals that closely resemble the morphology of their real counterparts. The realism of these synthesized signals was further gauged using a quality assessment model, which classified all as good quality, and a heart rate estimation model, which produced comparable results for generated and real data, with a Bland-Altman limit of 4.5 beats per minute. This advancement offers a promising solution for mitigating limited data availability and enhancing the training of DUS-based fetal models, making them more effective and generalizable.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel framework, NUCS, for coreset selection in transfer learning. NUCS addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating both class-level and instance-level criteria to create a balanced and representative subset for training. Through adaptive budget allocation and sample selection based on category difficulty, NUCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency across various datasets and architectures. Notably, NUCS achieves comparable accuracy to full-data training with 30% of samples and a 60% reduction in computation time on CIFAR100 and Food101. By emphasizing the importance of category difficulty in coreset selection, NUCS offers a robust and data-efficient solution for transfer learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As transfer learning models and datasets grow larger, efficient adaptation and storage optimization have become critical needs. Coreset selection addresses these challenges by identifying and retaining the most informative samples, constructing a compact subset for target domain training. However, current methods primarily rely on instance-level difficulty assessments, overlooking crucial category-level characteristics and consequently under-representing minority classes. To overcome this limitation, we propose Non-Uniform Class-Wise Coreset Selection (NUCS), a novel framework that integrates both class-level and instance-level criteria. NUCS automatically allocates data selection budgets for each class based on intrinsic category difficulty and adaptively selects samples within optimal difficulty ranges. By explicitly incorporating category-specific insights, our approach achieves a more balanced and representative coreset, addressing key shortcomings of prior methods. Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates the rationale behind adaptive budget allocation and sample selection, while extensive experiments across 14 diverse datasets and model architectures demonstrate NUCS's consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, on CIFAR100 and Food101, NUCS matches full-data training accuracy while retaining just 30% of samples and reducing computation time by 60%. Our work highlights the importance of characterizing category difficulty in coreset selection, offering a robust and data-efficient solution for transfer learning.

Abstract: This study presents an NNTile framework for training large deep neural networks in heterogeneous clusters. The NNTile is based on a StarPU library, which implements task-based parallelism and schedules all provided tasks onto all available processing units (CPUs and GPUs). It means that a particular operation, necessary to train a large neural network, can be performed on any of the CPU cores or GPU devices, depending on automatic scheduling decisions. Such an approach shifts the burden of deciding where to compute and when to communicate from a human being to an automatic decision maker, whether a simple greedy heuristic or a complex AI-based software. The performance of the presented tool for training large language models is demonstrated in extensive numerical experiments.

The RDIRL method is designed to be online, fast, and efficient, using sequential second-order Newton updates to recover the cost function governing adversary actions and goals. This approach minimizes an upper bound on the Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective and demonstrates superior performance in recovering cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that RDIRL outperforms several leading IRL algorithms, making it a promising candidate for real-time scenarios in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. <div>

Abstract: Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.

<div> neighbor explosion problem, graph neural networks, pre-propagation GNNs, training efficiency, scalability

Summary:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly used for learning node embeddings in graphs, but they face the neighbor explosion problem with increasing layers. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) offer a solution by separating feature propagation from training. This study compares PP-GNNs with graph-sampling methods, finding PP-GNNs achieve similar accuracy but face challenges in data loading efficiency and scalability due to input expansion. To improve training throughput, the researchers propose optimized data loading methods and tailored training techniques, resulting in a 15x increase in training efficiency over baseline PP-GNNs and significantly faster speeds compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph datasets. The implementation is open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cornell-zhang/preprop-gnn.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning node embeddings in graphs, typically adopting a message-passing scheme. This approach, however, leads to the neighbor explosion problem, with exponentially growing computational and memory demands as layers increase. Graph sampling has become the predominant method for scaling GNNs to large graphs, mitigating but not fully solving the issue. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) represent a new class of models that decouple feature propagation from training through pre-processing, addressing neighbor explosion in theory. Yet, their practical advantages and system-level optimizations remain underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of PP-GNNs, comparing them with graph-sampling-based methods in training efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. While PP-GNNs achieve comparable accuracy, we identify data loading as the key bottleneck for training efficiency and input expansion as a major scalability challenge. To address these issues, we propose optimized data loading schemes and tailored training methods that improve PP-GNN training throughput by an average of 15$\times$ over the PP-GNN baselines, with speedup of up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph benchmarks. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/cornell-zhang/preprop-gnn.

- GrokTransfer is a method proposed to accelerate grokking by leveraging data embedding to eliminate delayed generalization.
- GrokTransfer first trains a weaker model to reach a nontrivial test performance and then uses the learned input embedding to initialize the target model.

Abstract: ''Grokking'' is a phenomenon where a neural network first memorizes training data and generalizes poorly, but then suddenly transitions to near-perfect generalization after prolonged training. While intriguing, this delayed generalization phenomenon compromises predictability and efficiency. Ideally, models should generalize directly without delay. To this end, this paper proposes GrokTransfer, a simple and principled method for accelerating grokking in training neural networks, based on the key observation that data embedding plays a crucial role in determining whether generalization is delayed. GrokTransfer first trains a smaller, weaker model to reach a nontrivial (but far from optimal) test performance. Then, the learned input embedding from this weaker model is extracted and used to initialize the embedding in the target, stronger model. We rigorously prove that, on a synthetic XOR task where delayed generalization always occurs in normal training, GrokTransfer enables the target model to generalize directly without delay. Moreover, we demonstrate that, across empirical studies of different tasks, GrokTransfer effectively reshapes the training dynamics and eliminates delayed generalization, for both fully-connected neural networks and Transformers.

Summary:
The paper introduces a component-aware pruning strategy for deep neural networks (DNNs) to address the challenge of reducing model complexity in resource-constrained settings. By extending dependency graphs to isolate individual components and inter-component flows, the strategy creates smaller, targeted pruning groups that preserve network integrity.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver outstanding performance, but their complexity often prohibits deployment in resource-constrained settings. Comprehensive structured pruning frameworks based on parameter dependency analysis reduce model size with specific regard to computational performance. When applying them to Multi-Component Neural Architectures (MCNAs), they risk network integrity by removing large parameter groups. We introduce a component-aware pruning strategy, extending dependency graphs to isolate individual components and inter-component flows. This creates smaller, targeted pruning groups that conserve functional integrity. Demonstrated effectively on a control task, our approach achieves greater sparsity and reduced performance degradation, opening a path for optimizing complex, multi-component DNNs efficiently.

<br />Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach to accelerate the training of deep autoencoders using Hessian-free optimization. By incorporating the LSMR method, known for solving large sparse linear systems efficiently, and an improved preconditioner, the training process is optimized. A new mini-batch selection algorithm is proposed to prevent overfitting by starting with a small subset of training data and gradually increasing the mini-batch size based on variance estimates and objective value decrease for validation data. Experimental results show that this stochastic Hessian-free optimization results in faster training of deep autoencoders with improved generalization error. <div>
arXiv:2504.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hessian-free (HF) optimization has been shown to effectively train deep autoencoders (Martens, 2010). In this paper, we aim to accelerate HF training of autoencoders by reducing the amount of data used in training. HF utilizes the conjugate gradient algorithm to estimate update directions. Instead, we propose using the LSMR method, which is known for effectively solving large sparse linear systems. We also incorporate Chapelle & Erhan (2011)'s improved preconditioner for HF optimization. In addition, we introduce a new mini-batch selection algorithm to mitigate overfitting. Our algorithm starts with a small subset of the training data and gradually increases the mini-batch size based on (i) variance estimates obtained during the computation of a mini-batch gradient (Byrd et al., 2012) and (ii) the relative decrease in objective value for the validation data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our stochastic Hessian-free optimization, using the LSMR method and the new sample selection algorithm, leads to rapid training of deep autoencoders with improved generalization error.

Abstract: Depression is a complex mental disorder characterized by a diverse range of observable and measurable indicators that go beyond traditional subjective assessments. Recent research has increasingly focused on objective, passive, and continuous monitoring using wearable devices to gain more precise insights into the physiological and behavioral aspects of depression. However, most existing studies primarily distinguish between healthy and depressed individuals, adopting a binary classification that fails to capture the heterogeneity of depressive disorders. In this study, we leverage wearable devices to predict depression subtypes-specifically unipolar and bipolar depression-aiming to identify distinctive biomarkers that could enhance diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment strategies. To this end, we introduce the CALYPSO dataset, designed for non-invasive detection of depression subtypes and symptomatology through physiological and behavioral signals, including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Additionally, we establish a benchmark on the dataset using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Preliminary results indicate that features related to physical activity, extracted from accelerometer data, are the most effective in distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression, achieving an accuracy of $96.77\%$. Temperature-based features also showed high discriminative power, reaching an accuracy of $93.55\%$. These findings highlight the potential of physiological and behavioral monitoring for improving the classification of depressive subtypes, paving the way for more tailored clinical interventions.

Abstract: Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from the bifurcation diagram. Compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and high-frequency ranges.

<div> Keywords: IDRL, reinforcement learning, discriminator-weighted imitation, Dual-RL, offline datasets

Summary: 
IDRL introduces a new method for reinforcement learning that utilizes an optimal discriminator-weighted imitation approach. By training a discriminator with an offline dataset and additional expert dataset, IDRL achieves strong results across various datasets. The method aims to approach the optimal visitation distribution ratio in the offline dataset iteratively. By removing suboptimal transitions and updating the visitation distribution ratio in each iteration, IDRL improves performance and stability compared to Primal-RL and Dual-RL baselines. The approach demonstrates superior performance on D4RL datasets as well as more realistic corrupted demonstrations. IDRL's iterative approach represents a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios, ultimately leading to better results in reinforcement learning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Iterative Dual Reinforcement Learning (IDRL), a new method that takes an optimal discriminator-weighted imitation view of solving RL. Our method is motivated by a simple experiment in which we find training a discriminator using the offline dataset plus an additional expert dataset and then performing discriminator-weighted behavior cloning gives strong results on various types of datasets. That optimal discriminator weight is quite similar to the learned visitation distribution ratio in Dual-RL, however, we find that current Dual-RL methods do not correctly estimate that ratio. In IDRL, we propose a correction method to iteratively approach the optimal visitation distribution ratio in the offline dataset given no addtional expert dataset. During each iteration, IDRL removes zero-weight suboptimal transitions using the learned ratio from the previous iteration and runs Dual-RL on the remaining subdataset. This can be seen as replacing the behavior visitation distribution with the optimized visitation distribution from the previous iteration, which theoretically gives a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios that are closer to the optimal discriminator weight. We verify the effectiveness of IDRL on various kinds of offline datasets, including D4RL datasets and more realistic corrupted demonstrations. IDRL beats strong Primal-RL and Dual-RL baselines in terms of both performance and stability, on all datasets.

Summary:
The paper explores the mean teacher algorithm for language model unlearning, aiming to reduce memorization of specific text instances while maintaining the model's overall capabilities. By approximating a trajectory of slow natural gradient descent, the mean teacher method helps avoid high-curvature updates that could harm model utility. To address vanishing gradients, a new unlearning loss termed "negative log-unlikelihood" (NLUL) is introduced. The combination of mean teacher and NLUL shows improvements in metrics on the MUSE benchmarks. This research offers a promising approach to reducing dataset memorization in language models without sacrificing general performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the goals of language model unlearning is to reduce memorization of selected text instances while retaining the model's general abilities. Despite various proposed methods, reducing memorization of large datasets without noticeable degradation in model utility remains challenging. In this paper, we investigate the mean teacher algorithm (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), a simple proximal optimization method from continual learning literature that gradually modifies the teacher model. We show that the mean teacher can approximate a trajectory of a slow natural gradient descent (NGD), which inherently seeks low-curvature updates that are less likely to degrade the model utility. While slow NGD can suffer from vanishing gradients, we introduce a new unlearning loss called "negative log-unlikelihood" (NLUL) that avoids this problem. We show that the combination of mean teacher and NLUL improves some metrics on the MUSE benchmarks (Shi et al., 2024).

Abstract: Imitation learning is a widely used approach for training agents to replicate expert behavior in complex decision-making tasks. However, existing methods often struggle with compounding errors and limited generalization, due to the inherent challenge of error correction and the distribution shift between training and deployment. In this paper, we present a novel model-based imitation learning framework inspired by model predictive control, which addresses these limitations by integrating predictive modeling through multi-step state predictions. Our method outperforms traditional behavior cloning numerical benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness to distribution shift and measurement noise both in available data and during execution. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and error bounds of our method, offering insights into its convergence properties.

Summary:  
The paper introduces STAMP, a framework for detecting dataset membership in large language models. It addresses concerns about proprietary data inclusion in model training without attribution or licensing. STAMP involves embedding watermarks with unique secret keys in rephrased versions of the original content, enabling creators to compare public and private versions using statistical tests to prove dataset membership. The framework successfully detects contamination in benchmarks with minimal presence in training data. STAMP maintains semantic meaning and utility of the original data while comparing models. Application of STAMP to real-world scenarios confirms the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in pretraining corpora. <div>

Abstract: Given how large parts of publicly available text are crawled to pretrain large language models (LLMs), data creators increasingly worry about the inclusion of their proprietary data for model training without attribution or licensing. Their concerns are also shared by benchmark curators whose test-sets might be compromised. In this paper, we present STAMP, a framework for detecting dataset membership-i.e., determining the inclusion of a dataset in the pretraining corpora of LLMs. Given an original piece of content, our proposal involves first generating multiple rephrases, each embedding a watermark with a unique secret key. One version is to be released publicly, while others are to be kept private. Subsequently, creators can compare model likelihoods between public and private versions using paired statistical tests to prove membership. We show that our framework can successfully detect contamination across four benchmarks which appear only once in the training data and constitute less than 0.001% of the total tokens, outperforming several contamination detection and dataset inference baselines. We verify that STAMP preserves both the semantic meaning and the utility of the original data in comparing different models. We apply STAMP to two real-world scenarios to confirm the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in the pretraining corpora.

Summary:
Neural surrogate solvers can efficiently estimate solutions to partial differential equations in physical problems but require extensive high-resolution training data. This paper introduces a super-resolution learning framework in solid mechanics, allowing training of high-resolution neural networks using only low-resolution data. The Equilibrium Conserving Operator (ECO) architecture embeds known physics directly into the network to compensate for missing high-resolution information during training. ECO-based super-resolution framework, which strongly enforces conservation-laws in the predicted solutions, is evaluated on examples like embedded pores in a homogenized matrix and randomly textured polycrystalline materials. ECO eliminates the need for high-fidelity data, reducing the upfront cost of data collection significantly, making it a robust and resource-efficient pathway for surrogate modeling in materials science. The ECO approach is applicable to a wide range of physics-based problems.

Abstract: Neural surrogate solvers can estimate solutions to partial differential equations in physical problems more efficiently than standard numerical methods, but require extensive high-resolution training data. In this paper, we break this limitation; we introduce a framework for super-resolution learning in solid mechanics problems. Our approach allows one to train a high-resolution neural network using only low-resolution data. Our Equilibrium Conserving Operator (ECO) architecture embeds known physics directly into the network to make up for missing high-resolution information during training. We evaluate this ECO-based super-resolution framework that strongly enforces conservation-laws in the predicted solutions on two working examples: embedded pores in a homogenized matrix and randomly textured polycrystalline materials. ECO eliminates the reliance on high-fidelity data and reduces the upfront cost of data collection by two orders of magnitude, offering a robust pathway for resource-efficient surrogate modeling in materials modeling. ECO is readily generalizable to other physics-based problems.

Summary: 
- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained popularity for processing graph-structured data, but their shallow model architecture leads to over-smoothing.
- Current approaches to addressing over-smoothing involve adding components like residual connections, but deep GCN success remains limited.
- Messages in GCNs traverse through low-order neighbors, leading to over-aggregation and redundant information aggregation.
- Over-aggregation introduces significant redundancy and is the fundamental cause of over-smoothing in GCNs. 
- Analyzing the intrinsic message passing mechanism of GCNs sheds light on the critical issue of over-aggregation, providing insights for optimizing GCN architectures. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained popularity for their exceptional ability to process graph-structured data. Existing GCN-based approaches typically employ a shallow model architecture due to the over-smoothing phenomenon. Current approaches to mitigating over-smoothing primarily involve adding supplementary components to GCN architectures, such as residual connections and random edge-dropping strategies. However, these improvements toward deep GCNs have achieved only limited success. In this work, we analyze the intrinsic message passing mechanism of GCNs and identify a critical issue: messages originating from high-order neighbors must traverse through low-order neighbors to reach the target node. This repeated reliance on low-order neighbors leads to redundant information aggregation, a phenomenon we term over-aggregation. Our analysis demonstrates that over-aggregation not only introduces significant redundancy but also serves as the fundamental cause of over-smoothing in GCNs.

<div> Keywords: Graph neural networks, out-of-distribution detection, negative energy scores, NODESAFE, node-level OOD data detection

Summary:
NODESAFE introduces a novel approach to improve the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data at the node level. Current methods like GNNSAFE have limitations due to extreme score values and logit shifts, reducing accuracy in OOD detection. NODESAFE addresses this issue by incorporating optimization terms to constrain negative energy scores and mitigate logit shifts, effectively reducing the generation of extreme scores. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in OOD detection, with FPR95 metrics showing a substantial reduction compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. For example, in scenarios with and without OOD data exposure induced by Structure Manipulation, the FPR95 metric is decreased by 28.4% and 22.7%, respectively. NODESAFE offers a promising solution to enhance the ability of GNNs to accurately detect node-level OOD data in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the critical role of graphs in real-world applications and their high-security requirements, improving the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an urgent research problem. The recent work GNNSAFE proposes a framework based on the aggregation of negative energy scores that significantly improves the performance of GNNs to detect node-level OOD data. However, our study finds that score aggregation among nodes is susceptible to extreme values due to the unboundedness of the negative energy scores and logit shifts, which severely limits the accuracy of GNNs in detecting node-level OOD data. In this paper, we propose NODESAFE: reducing the generation of extreme scores of nodes by adding two optimization terms that make the negative energy scores bounded and mitigate the logit shift. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically improves the ability of GNNs to detect OOD data at the node level, e.g., in detecting OOD data induced by Structure Manipulation, the metric of FPR95 (lower is better) in scenarios without (with) OOD data exposure are reduced from the current SOTA by 28.4% (22.7%).

Summary: 
This study evaluates machine learning models and neural networks for predicting chaotic systems, specifically the multi-pendulum. Synthetic data is generated using the Runge Kutta Method, and various models are tested based on RMSE and R^2 values. A sliding window approach and time-step based approach are compared to accurately capture chaotic motion. The stability of the system is evaluated using Lyapunov exponents. For a double pendulum, the LSTM network performs best in both scenarios. For a triple pendulum, the VRNN is best for the sliding window approach, and the GRU is best for the time step approach in frictionless scenarios. However, in the presence of friction, the LSTM outperforms other models. <div>

Abstract: A chaotic system is a highly volatile system characterized by its sensitive dependence on initial conditions and outside factors. Chaotic systems are prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks, and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations (ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach, predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However, to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles, or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for friction, LSTM was the best.

<div> Stratify, Federated Learning, Non-IID data, Data heterogeneity, Incremental adjustments <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Stratify, a novel Federated Learning framework designed to address challenges posed by non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data. By systematically managing class and feature distributions using a Stratified Label Schedule (SLS), Stratify reduces bias and variance in aggregated gradients. The approach includes a label-aware client selection strategy to ensure participation only from clients with relevant data. A fine-grained update scheme accelerates convergence and mitigates data heterogeneity, while a secure client selection protocol preserves privacy. Evaluations on various datasets show that Stratify achieves performance comparable to IID baselines, accelerates convergence, and reduces client-side computation. The framework demonstrates practical effectiveness in realistic federated learning scenarios. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data remains a critical challenge, as existing approaches struggle with severe data heterogeneity. Current methods primarily address symptoms of non-IID by applying incremental adjustments to Federated Averaging (FedAvg), rather than directly resolving its inherent design limitations. Consequently, performance significantly deteriorates under highly heterogeneous conditions, as the fundamental issue of imbalanced exposure to diverse class and feature distributions remains unresolved. This paper introduces Stratify, a novel FL framework designed to systematically manage class and feature distributions throughout training, effectively tackling the root cause of non-IID challenges. Inspired by classical stratified sampling, our approach employs a Stratified Label Schedule (SLS) to ensure balanced exposure across labels, significantly reducing bias and variance in aggregated gradients. Complementing SLS, we propose a label-aware client selection strategy, restricting participation exclusively to clients possessing data relevant to scheduled labels. Additionally, Stratify incorporates a fine-grained, high-frequency update scheme, accelerating convergence and further mitigating data heterogeneity. To uphold privacy, we implement a secure client selection protocol leveraging homomorphic encryption, enabling precise global label statistics without disclosing sensitive client information. Extensive evaluations on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, COVTYPE, PACS, and Digits-DG demonstrate that Stratify attains performance comparable to IID baselines, accelerates convergence, and reduces client-side computation compared to state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its practical effectiveness in realistic federated learning scenarios.

The paper introduces SURE, a novel framework for improving pretrained multimodal models by addressing missing modalities and uncertainty estimation. SURE utilizes latent space reconstruction and statistical error propagation to reconstruct missing modalities and provide reliable uncertainty estimates.

SURE achieves state-of-the-art performance by delivering interpretable results and robust predictions even with incomplete data. <div>
arXiv:2504.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.

Abstract: Phytoplankton absorb and scatter light in unique ways, subtly altering the color of water, changes that are often minor for human eyes to detect but can be captured by sensitive ocean color instruments onboard satellites from space. Hyperspectral sensors, paired with advanced algorithms, are expected to significantly enhance the characterization of phytoplankton community composition, especially in coastal waters where ocean color remote sensing applications have historically encountered significant challenges. This study presents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral missions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to varied combinations of inherent optical properties and associated concentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this study to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time tailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral retrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex estuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation demonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low bias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning designs highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over the mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional data, such as PACE. Our study provides strong evidence that current EMIT and PACE hyperspectral data as well as the upcoming Surface Biology Geology mission will open new pathways toward a better understanding of phytoplankton community dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when integrated with AI technologies.

Abstract: The safety of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems is compromised by the well-known vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Existing literature has sought to monitor the safety of such systems by detecting OOD data. However, such approaches have limited utility, as the presence of an OOD input does not necessarily imply the violation of a desired safety property. We instead propose to directly monitor safety in a manner that is itself robust to OOD data. To this end, we predict violations of signal temporal logic safety specifications based on predicted future trajectories. Our safety monitor additionally uses a novel combination of adaptive conformal prediction and incremental learning. The former obtains probabilistic prediction guarantees even on OOD data, and the latter prevents overly conservative predictions. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach in two case studies on safety monitoring: 1) predicting collisions of an F1Tenth car with static obstacles, and 2) predicting collisions of a race car with multiple dynamic obstacles. We find that adaptive conformal prediction obtains theoretical guarantees where other uncertainty quantification methods fail to do so. Additionally, combining adaptive conformal prediction and incremental learning for safety monitoring achieves high recall and timeliness while reducing loss in precision. We achieve these results even in OOD settings and outperform alternative methods.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Locality-Aware Attention Transformer (LA2Former) as a solution to the limitations of current linear attention methods in dealing with complex and irregular PDEs. LA2Former incorporates K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and combines global and local attention to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations on six benchmark datasets show that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy by over 50% compared to existing linear attention methods and outperforms full pairwise attention in optimal conditions. This work highlights the importance of localized feature learning in enhancing Transformer-based neural operators for solving PDEs on complex and irregular domains.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising frameworks for learning mappings governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), serving as data-driven alternatives to traditional numerical methods. While methods such as the Fourier neural operator (FNO) have demonstrated notable performance, their reliance on uniform grids restricts their applicability to complex geometries and irregular meshes. Recently, Transformer-based neural operators with linear attention mechanisms have shown potential in overcoming these limitations for large-scale PDE simulations. However, these approaches predominantly emphasize global feature aggregation, often overlooking fine-scale dynamics and localized PDE behaviors essential for accurate solutions. To address these challenges, we propose the Locality-Aware Attention Transformer (LA2Former), which leverages K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and integrates global-local attention for enhanced PDE modeling. By combining linear attention for efficient global context encoding with pairwise attention for capturing intricate local interactions, LA2Former achieves an optimal balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy by over 50% relative to existing linear attention methods, while also outperforming full pairwise attention under optimal conditions. This work underscores the critical importance of localized feature learning in advancing Transformer-based neural operators for solving PDEs on complex and irregular domains.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has emerged as a key smart grid technology, identifying electrical device and providing detailed energy consumption data for precise demand response management. Nevertheless, NILM data suffers from missing values due to inescapable factors like sensor failure, leading to inaccuracies in non-intrusive load monitoring. A stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based latent factorization of tensors model has proven to be effective in estimating missing data, however, it updates a latent factor solely based on the current stochastic gradient, without considering past information, which leads to slow convergence of anLFT model. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-Incorporated Latent factorization of tensors (NPIL) model with two-fold ideas: a) rebuilding the instant learning error according to the principle of a nonlinear PID controller, thus, the past update information is efficiently incorporated into the learning scheme, and b) implementing gain parameter adaptation by utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, hence, the model computational efficiency is effectively improved. Experimental results on real-world NILM datasets demonstrate that the proposed NPIL model surpasses state-of-the-art models in convergence rate and accuracy when predicting the missing NILM data.

Summary: 
The article discusses concerns about the vulnerability of neural networks to distribution shift in learning-enabled cyber-physical systems. Traditional methods focus on detecting distribution shift during inference to enable abstaining from decision-making, but this approach has limitations in practical applications. The proposal suggests a monitor and recover paradigm for future research, emphasizing robust safety monitoring and distribution shift recovery. This paradigm aims to address the challenges posed by distribution shift more effectively. The article highlights two examples from recent work as illustrations of the proposed approach. <div>
arXiv:2504.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the known vulnerability of neural networks to distribution shift, maintaining reliability in learning-enabled cyber-physical systems poses a salient challenge. In response, many existing methods adopt a detect and abstain methodology, aiming to detect distribution shift at inference time so that the learning-enabled component can abstain from decision-making. This approach, however, has limited use in real-world applications. We instead propose a monitor and recover paradigm as a promising direction for future research. This philosophy emphasizes 1) robust safety monitoring instead of distribution shift detection and 2) distribution shift recovery instead of abstention. We discuss two examples from our recent work.

Summary: Existing portfolio management models are often black-box and non-transparent, making it challenging to optimize performance while controlling risk. This study introduces a Bayesian optimization framework that considers dual objectives of maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of observations. By incorporating an adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator, the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management models. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimator in improving performance and reducing risk accumulation. Ablation studies further validate the superiority of the proposed approach in optimizing black-box portfolio management models under limited observations. The framework provides a solution to the critical challenge of optimizing performance while controlling risk in financial systems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing portfolio management approaches are often black-box models due to safety and commercial issues in the industry. However, their performance can vary considerably whenever market conditions or internal trading strategies change. Furthermore, evaluating these non-transparent systems is expensive, where certain budgets limit observations of the systems. Therefore, optimizing performance while controlling the potential risk of these financial systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework to optimize black-box portfolio management models under limited observations. In conventional Bayesian optimization settings, the objective function is to maximize the expectation of performance metrics. However, simply maximizing performance expectations leads to erratic optimization trajectories, which exacerbate risk accumulation in portfolio management. Meanwhile, this can lead to misalignment between the target distribution and the actual distribution of the black-box model. To mitigate this problem, we propose an adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator considering dual objective, which incorporates maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of model observations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over five backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management models. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.

<div> RNNs, BPTT, target propagation, local representation alignment, gradient regularization<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing and cases with limited training data. However, their training algorithm, Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), has drawbacks. This study introduces a target propagation-based method for RNNs, focusing on reducing instability. The proposed approach, using local representation alignment (LRA), aims to enhance RNN practicality in various applications. Analysis reveals that despite network decomposition, vanishing gradients persist. Gradient clipping, a proposed solution, shows limited impact. To address vanishing gradients, gradient regularization in the update direction is introduced, promoting gradient flow and improving convergence. Experimental results on tasks like temporal order demonstrate the superiority of the regularized LRA RNN over the unregularized version. This research contributes valuable insights into enhancing RNN performance and stability in challenging tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics.
  The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.

<div> Transformer, approximation, function class, curse of dimensionality, expressive capability
Summary: 
- This paper explores the use of Transformers to approximate H\"older continuous function classes.
- Transformers with one self-attention layer and specific activation functions can achieve high approximation accuracy with relatively few feedforward layers.
- The construction is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, offering a clear and intuitive proof compared to previous works.
- The results demonstrate the strong expressive capability of Transformers in overcoming the curse of dimensionality.
- The translation technique proposed in the paper facilitates the application of previous approximation results from feedforward neural networks to Transformer research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer model is widely used in various application areas of machine learning, such as natural language processing. This paper investigates the approximation of the H\"older continuous function class $\mathcal{H}_{Q}^{\beta}\left([0,1]^{d\times n},\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}\right)$ by Transformers and constructs several Transformers that can overcome the curse of dimensionality. These Transformers consist of one self-attention layer with one head and the softmax function as the activation function, along with several feedforward layers. For example, to achieve an approximation accuracy of $\epsilon$, if the activation functions of the feedforward layers in the Transformer are ReLU and floor, only $\mathcal{O}\left(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ layers of feedforward layers are needed, with widths of these layers not exceeding $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2/\beta}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$. If other activation functions are allowed in the feedforward layers, the width of the feedforward layers can be further reduced to a constant. These results demonstrate that Transformers have a strong expressive capability. The construction in this paper is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem and does not require the concept of contextual mapping, hence our proof is more intuitively clear compared to previous Transformer approximation works. Additionally, the translation technique proposed in this paper helps to apply the previous approximation results of feedforward neural networks to Transformer research.

arXiv:2504.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological synapses effortlessly balance memory retention and flexibility, yet artificial neural networks still struggle with the extremes of catastrophic forgetting and catastrophic remembering. Here, we introduce Metaplasticity from Synaptic Uncertainty (MESU), a Bayesian framework that updates network parameters according their uncertainty. This approach allows a principled combination of learning and forgetting that ensures that critical knowledge is preserved while unused or outdated information is gradually released. Unlike standard Bayesian approaches -- which risk becoming overly constrained, and popular continual-learning methods that rely on explicit task boundaries, MESU seamlessly adapts to streaming data. It further provides reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates, allowing out-of-distribution detection, the only computational cost being to sample the weights multiple times to provide proper output statistics. Experiments on image-classification benchmarks demonstrate that MESU mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while maintaining plasticity for new tasks. When training 200 sequential permuted MNIST tasks, MESU outperforms established continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy, capability to learn additional tasks, and out-of-distribution data detection. Additionally, due to its non-reliance on task boundaries, MESU outperforms conventional learning techniques on the incremental training of CIFAR-100 tasks consistently in a wide range of scenarios. Our results unify ideas from metaplasticity, Bayesian inference, and Hessian-based regularization, offering a biologically-inspired pathway to robust, perpetual learning.

Abstract: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms, despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features, adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%) models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.

In this study, the authors explore the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze sentiment embedded within non-financial content on cryptocurrency blockchains.

The findings highlight the significance of blockchain sentiment analysis as a valuable tool for enhancing financial predictions in cryptocurrency markets.

arXiv:2504.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchains, beyond their primary role as distributed payment systems, are increasingly used to store and share arbitrary content, such as text messages and files. Although often non-financial, this hidden content can impact price movements by conveying private information, shaping sentiment, and influencing public opinion. However, current analyses of such data are limited in scope and scalability, primarily relying on manual classification or hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, we address these limitations by employing Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze, detect patterns, and extract public sentiment encoded within blockchain transactional data. Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, we showcase for the first time the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting cryptocurrency price movements on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Our findings shed light on a previously underexplored source of freely available, transparent, and immutable data and introduce blockchain sentiment analysis as a novel and robust framework for enhancing financial predictions in cryptocurrency markets. Incidentally, we discover an asymmetry between cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has an informational advantage over Ethereum in that the sentiment embedded into transactional data is sufficient to predict its price movement.

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of machine unlearning, focusing on eliminating specific data from a pretrained model to address privacy concerns. Previous research has shown accuracy and efficiency in approximated unlearning but lacks exact unlearning capabilities. This study proposes fairness Conjectures based on the variance-bias trade-off and highlights the correlation between fairness and robustness in machine unlearning algorithms. Experiments on ResNet and ViT architectures illustrate that models with a higher fairness gap are more sensitive and vulnerable. Current approximated unlearning algorithms are susceptible to adversarial attacks, leading to a significant decrease in accuracy for unlearned models compared to exact-unlearned models. The article suggests using fairness-gap measurement and robustness metric for algorithm evaluation and advocates for unlearning in intermediate and last layers to optimize time and memory complexity.

arXiv:2504.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning poses the challenge of ``how to eliminate the influence of specific data from a pretrained model'' in regard to privacy concerns. While prior research on approximated unlearning has demonstrated accuracy and efficiency in time complexity, we claim that it falls short of achieving exact unlearning, and we are the first to focus on fairness and robustness in machine unlearning algorithms. Our study presents fairness Conjectures for a well-trained model, based on the variance-bias trade-off characteristic, and considers their relevance to robustness. Our Conjectures are supported by experiments conducted on the two most widely used model architectures, ResNet and ViT, demonstrating the correlation between fairness and robustness: \textit{the higher fairness-gap is, the more the model is sensitive and vulnerable}. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of current state-of-the-art approximated unlearning algorithms to adversarial attacks, where their unlearned models suffer a significant drop in accuracy compared to the exact-unlearned models. We claim that our fairness-gap measurement and robustness metric should be used to evaluate the unlearning algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unlearning in the intermediate and last layers is sufficient and cost-effective for time and memory complexity.

Summary:
Generative diffusion models' performance relies on choosing the appropriate noise scheduling function or time reparameterization. This study introduces a time scheduler based on entropy rather than uniform spacing, ensuring each sampling point contributes equally to generation. The entropic time is independent of the initial time choice, with a tractable formula for estimation. Additionally, a rescaled entropic time is introduced based on optimality results. Experimental results with Gaussian mixtures and ImageNet demonstrate improved inference performance using entropic and rescaled entropic times. Notably, pretrained EDM2 models show significantly enhanced image quality, based on FID and FD-DINO scores, without increasing function evaluations, especially in the few NFEs regime. <div>

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

Summary: 
The paper introduces an efficient algorithm for the Hadamard decomposition, a technique used for data analysis and matrix compression. By leveraging alternating optimization, the global non-convex problem is decomposed into convex sub-problems. Advanced initialization strategies, inspired by SVD, and acceleration techniques, such as momentum-based updates, are incorporated to enhance performance. The algorithm supports more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.

<div> Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning, Prototypical Networks, Graph Continual Learning, Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning, catastrophic forgetting<br />
<br />
Summary: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) is a method that allows models to learn from limited samples of new tasks after initial training on a large dataset. The current approach using Prototypical Networks (PNs) oversimplifies learning and does not integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques effectively. To address these challenges, a new method called Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA) is proposed. MEGA focuses on alleviating catastrophic forgetting by incorporating incremental second-order gradients during meta-training. This allows the model to learn high-quality priors that improve incremental learning. Experimental results on several graph datasets show that MEGA outperforms existing methods, making it a model-agnostic paradigm for Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning. The integration of MEGA enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in this context, paving the way for future research. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.

Summary:
Dynamic Regularized Causal Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT) is proposed to address the limitations of existing tree-based causal inference techniques in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in high-stakes applications. The framework integrates variance regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function, dynamically updating regularization parameters using gradient statistics to balance bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments show that CBDT improves estimation accuracy and maintains reliable coverage of true treatment effects, with successful identification of clinically actionable rules and high accuracy in treatment effect estimation in an intensive care unit patient triage study. The results validate that dynamic regularization enhances predictive performance and model interpretability, tightening error bounds effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands models that simultaneously optimize precision, interpretability, and calibration. Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however, exhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they struggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static regularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function of gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the regularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true treatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method successfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy in treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic regularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability.

<div> Keywords: token attribution, language model, attention weights, Attribution with Attention, question answering

Summary: 
Attribution with Attention (AT2) is proposed as a method to efficiently attribute the influence of preceding tokens on a language model's generated sequence. Traditional approaches to token attribution involve ablation of tokens, which can be costly. AT2 leverages attention weights as a heuristic for understanding token influence, treating the attention weights of different heads as features to learn effective attribution. This approach outperforms naive methods and performs on par with ablation-based approaches while being more efficient. By using AT2, less important parts of a provided context in a question answering setting can be pruned, leading to improved answer quality. The code for AT2 is available on GitHub for researchers to utilize. The method showcases the utility of attention weights in understanding language model behavior and enhancing model performance.

arXiv:2504.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens generated by a language model, we may want to identify the preceding tokens that influence the model to generate this sequence. Performing such token attribution is expensive; a common approach is to ablate preceding tokens and directly measure their effects. To reduce the cost of token attribution, we revisit attention weights as a heuristic for how a language model uses previous tokens. Naive approaches to attribute model behavior with attention (e.g., averaging attention weights across attention heads to estimate a token's influence) have been found to be unreliable. To attain faithful attributions, we propose treating the attention weights of different attention heads as features. This way, we can learn how to effectively leverage attention weights for attribution (using signal from ablations). Our resulting method, Attribution with Attention (AT2), reliably performs on par with approaches that involve many ablations, while being significantly more efficient. To showcase the utility of AT2, we use it to prune less important parts of a provided context in a question answering setting, improving answer quality. We provide code for AT2 at https://github.com/MadryLab/AT2 .

Summary: 
- Childhood vaccination coverage disparities in England persist due to complex interactions among geographic, cultural, demographic, socioeconomic factors.
- Longitudinal machine learning analysis from 2021 to 2024 using NHS records classified districts into low- and high-coverage clusters.
- CatBoost classifier accurately predicted districts' vaccination clusters based on geographic, cultural, demographic data.
- SHAP method identified rurality, English proficiency, foreign-born residents, ethnic composition as key predictors of vaccination coverage.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Childhood vaccination is a cornerstone of public health, yet disparities in vaccination coverage persist across England. These disparities are shaped by complex interactions among various factors, including geographic, demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural (GDSC) factors. Previous studies mostly rely on cross-sectional data and traditional statistical approaches that assess individual or limited sets of variables in isolation. Such methods may fall short in capturing the dynamic and multivariate nature of vaccine uptake. In this paper, we conducted a longitudinal machine learning analysis of childhood vaccination coverage across 150 districts in England from 2021 to 2024. Using vaccination data from NHS records, we applied hierarchical clustering to group districts by vaccination coverage into low- and high-coverage clusters. A CatBoost classifier was then trained to predict districts' vaccination clusters using their GDSC data. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the predictors' importance. The classifier achieved high accuracies of 92.1, 90.6, and 86.3 in predicting districts' vaccination clusters for the years 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024, respectively. SHAP revealed that geographic, cultural, and demographic variables, particularly rurality, English language proficiency, the percentage of foreign-born residents, and ethnic composition, were the most influential predictors of vaccination coverage, whereas socioeconomic variables, such as deprivation and employment, consistently showed lower importance, especially in 2023-2024. Surprisingly, rural districts were significantly more likely to have higher vaccination rates. Additionally, districts with lower vaccination coverage had higher populations whose first language was not English, who were born outside the UK, or who were from ethnic minority groups.

<div> Sparse autoencoders, in-context learning (ICL), mechanism, latent vectors, task vectors <br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the effectiveness of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in interpreting language model activations to deepen understanding of in-context learning (ICL). It identifies abstract SAE features that encode the model's knowledge of task execution and shows that these features causally induce zero-shot tasks, aligning with prior findings on task vectors. The study demonstrates that task vectors can be approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including task-execution features. By adapting sparse feature circuits to the Gemma-1 2B model for ICL, task-detecting features with corresponding SAE latents are discovered, activating earlier in the prompt to detect task completion. These features are linked with task-execution features through attention and MLP sublayers, providing insights into the ICL mechanism. <div>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular tool for interpreting large language model activations, but their utility in addressing open questions in interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate their effectiveness by using SAEs to deepen our understanding of the mechanism behind in-context learning (ICL). We identify abstract SAE features that (i) encode the model's knowledge of which task to execute and (ii) whose latent vectors causally induce the task zero-shot. This aligns with prior work showing that ICL is mediated by task vectors. We further demonstrate that these task vectors are well approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including these task-execution features. To explore the ICL mechanism, we adapt the sparse feature circuits methodology of Marks et al. (2024) to work for the much larger Gemma-1 2B model, with 30 times as many parameters, and to the more complex task of ICL. Through circuit finding, we discover task-detecting features with corresponding SAE latents that activate earlier in the prompt, that detect when tasks have been performed. They are causally linked with task-execution features through the attention and MLP sublayers.

It incorporates an equivariant message-passing scheme and a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism to capture interactions and temporal influences. Specifically designed for cylindrical roller bearings, it accurately predicts loads and trajectories under various conditions.

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.

Summary: 
DP2Unlearning is a novel framework for efficiently unlearning sensitive or undesired information from Large Language Models (LLMs) while providing formal forgetting guarantees. It utilizes differential privacy to protect textual data during training, enabling cost-effective unlearning with privacy guarantees. Compared to retraining LLMs from scratch on retained data, DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning at half the cost. It outperforms approximate unlearning methods in preserving model utility and effectively forgetting targeted information. The framework offers a balance between privacy protection and model performance, making it a promising solution for addressing ethical and legal concerns associated with LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2504.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

Abstract: We investigate the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to bit-flip attacks (BFAs) by introducing an analytical framework to study the influence of architectural features, graph properties, and their interaction.
  The expressivity of GNNs refers to their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs and depends on the encoding of node neighborhoods. We examine the vulnerability of neural multiset functions commonly used for this purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize a GNN's susceptibility to losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis of the impact of homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation functions on GNN robustness. We derive theoretical bounds for the number of bit flips required to degrade GNN expressivity on a dataset, identifying ReLU-activated GNNs operating on highly homophilous graphs with low-dimensional or one-hot encoded features as particularly susceptible. Empirical results using ten real-world datasets confirm the statistical significance of our key theoretical insights and offer actionable results to mitigate BFA risks in expressivity-critical applications.

Abstract: Stability guarantees are an emerging tool for evaluating feature attributions, but existing certification methods rely on smoothed classifiers and often yield conservative guarantees. To address these limitations, we introduce soft stability and propose a simple, model-agnostic, and sample-efficient stability certification algorithm (SCA) that provides non-trivial and interpretable guarantees for any attribution. Moreover, we show that mild smoothing enables a graceful tradeoff between accuracy and stability, in contrast to prior certification methods that require a more aggressive compromise. Using Boolean function analysis, we give a novel characterization of stability under smoothing. We evaluate SCA on vision and language tasks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of soft stability in measuring the robustness of explanation methods.

Abstract: In machine learning, quantization is widely used to simplify data representation and facilitate algorithm deployment on hardware. Given the fundamental role of classification in machine learning, it is crucial to investigate the impact of quantization on classification. Current research primarily focuses on quantization errors, operating under the premise that higher quantization errors generally result in lower classification performance. However, this premise lacks a solid theoretical foundation and often contradicts empirical findings. For instance, certain extremely low bit-width quantization methods, such as $\{0,1\}$-binary quantization and $\{0, \pm1\}$-ternary quantization, can achieve comparable or even superior classification accuracy compared to the original non-quantized data, despite exhibiting high quantization errors. To more accurately evaluate classification performance, we propose to directly investigate the feature discrimination of quantized data, instead of analyzing its quantization error. Interestingly, it is found that both binary and ternary quantization methods can improve, rather than degrade, the feature discrimination of the original data. This remarkable performance is validated through classification experiments across various data types, including images, speech, and texts.

Abstract: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rotating machinery is critical for industrial safety and maintenance, but existing methods struggle with scarce target-domain data and unclear degradation dynamics. We propose a Meta-Learning and Knowledge Discovery-based Physics-Informed Neural Network (MKDPINN) to address these challenges. The method first maps noisy sensor data to a low-dimensional hidden state space via a Hidden State Mapper (HSM). A Physics-Guided Regulator (PGR) then learns unknown nonlinear PDEs governing degradation evolution, embedding these physical constraints into the PINN framework. This integrates data-driven and physics-based approaches. The framework uses meta-learning, optimizing across source-domain meta-tasks to enable few-shot adaptation to new target tasks. Experiments on industrial data and the C-MAPSS benchmark show MKDPINN outperforms baselines in generalization and accuracy, proving its effectiveness for RUL prediction under data scarcity

Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field, unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However, these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning. However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions. Our goal is to highlight the synergy between CL and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, guide researchers in this field, and pave the way for novel future research directions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has transformed healthcare, particularly in cancer detection and diagnosis. DL surpasses traditional machine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying diseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive analysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies focus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact. This paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL), Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance accuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while maintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets, improving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic pathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model development without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs, traditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical data for improved interpretability. Additionally, this review examines these techniques' efficiency in cancer diagnosis, addresses challenges like data imbalance, and proposes solutions. It serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and guiding future research in advanced DL for cancer detection.

Abstract: For a single-gateway LoRaWAN network, this study proposed a history-enhanced two-phase actor-critic algorithm with a shared transformer algorithm (HEAT) to improve network performance. HEAT considers uplink parameters and often neglected downlink parameters, and effectively integrates offline and online reinforcement learning, using historical data and real-time interaction to improve model performance. In addition, this study developed an open source LoRaWAN network simulator LoRaWANSim. The simulator considers the demodulator lock effect and supports multi-channel, multi-demodulator and bidirectional communication. Simulation experiments show that compared with the best results of all compared algorithms, HEAT improves the packet success rate and energy efficiency by 15% and 95%, respectively.

<title>Concept Enhancement Engineering: A Lightweight and Efficient Robust Defense Against Jailbreak Attacks in Embodied AI</title>

Abstract: Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems integrated with large language models (LLMs) face significant security risks, particularly from jailbreak attacks that manipulate models into generating harmful outputs or executing unsafe physical actions. Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2) constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and (3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios. X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2% attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs.

Abstract: As urbanization speeds up and traffic flow increases, the issue of pavement distress is becoming increasingly pronounced, posing a severe threat to road safety and service life. Traditional methods of pothole detection rely on manual inspection, which is not only inefficient but also costly. This paper proposes an intelligent road crack detection and analysis system, based on the enhanced YOLOv8 deep learning framework. A target segmentation model has been developed through the training of 4029 images, capable of efficiently and accurately recognizing and segmenting crack regions in roads. The model also analyzes the segmented regions to precisely calculate the maximum and minimum widths of cracks and their exact locations. Experimental results indicate that the incorporation of ECA and CBAM attention mechanisms substantially enhances the model's detection accuracy and efficiency, offering a novel solution for road maintenance and safety monitoring.

Abstract: Causality and game theory are two influential fields that contribute significantly to decision-making in various domains. Causality defines and models causal relationships in complex policy problems, while game theory provides insights into strategic interactions among stakeholders with competing interests. Integrating these frameworks has led to significant theoretical advancements with the potential to improve decision-making processes. However, practical applications of these developments remain underexplored. To support efforts toward implementation, this paper clarifies key concepts in game theory and causality that are essential to their intersection, particularly within the context of probabilistic graphical models. By rigorously examining these concepts and illustrating them with intuitive, consistent examples, we clarify the required inputs for implementing these models, provide practitioners with insights into their application and selection across different scenarios, and reference existing research that supports their implementation. We hope this work encourages broader adoption of these models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce KFinEval-Pilot, a benchmark suite specifically designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the Korean financial domain. Addressing the limitations of existing English-centric benchmarks, KFinEval-Pilot comprises over 1,000 curated questions across three critical areas: financial knowledge, legal reasoning, and financial toxicity. The benchmark is constructed through a semi-automated pipeline that combines GPT-4-generated prompts with expert validation to ensure domain relevance and factual accuracy. We evaluate a range of representative LLMs and observe notable performance differences across models, with trade-offs between task accuracy and output safety across different model families. These results highlight persistent challenges in applying LLMs to high-stakes financial applications, particularly in reasoning and safety. Grounded in real-world financial use cases and aligned with the Korean regulatory and linguistic context, KFinEval-Pilot serves as an early diagnostic tool for developing safer and more reliable financial AI systems.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets, where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper, we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency.

Abstract: This article considers the problem of designing adaption and optimisation techniques for training quantum learning machines. To this end, the division algebra of quaternions is used to derive an effective model for representing computation and measurement operations on qubits. In turn, the derived model, serves as the foundation for formulating an adaptive learning problem on principal quantum learning units, thereby establishing quantum information processing units akin to that of neurons in classical approaches. Then, leveraging the modern HR-calculus, a comprehensive training framework for learning on quantum machines is developed. The quaternion-valued model accommodates mathematical tractability and establishment of performance criteria, such as convergence conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing long-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact of fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored. In this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of fine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning (fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning demonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent class conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to optimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates semantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time ensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our framework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast convergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+ significantly reduces both training epochs (from $\sim$100 to $\leq$15) and learned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches by a considerable margin.

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.

<title>Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. Standard implementations rely on Gaussian approximations, which can often accurately predict the mean response but usually introduce significant biases in higher-order moments, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis. To address this limitation, we combine GFDT with recent advances in score-based generative modeling, which enable direct estimation of the score function from data without requiring full density reconstruction. Our method is validated on three reduced-order stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: a scalar stochastic model for low-frequency climate variability, a slow-fast triad model mimicking key features of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and a six-dimensional stochastic barotropic model capturing atmospheric regime transitions. In all cases, the approach captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.

<title>On the minimax optimality of Flow Matching through the connection to kernel density estimation</title>

Abstract: Flow Matching has recently gained attention in generative modeling as a simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, the current state of the art. While existing statistical guarantees adapt tools from the analysis of diffusion models, we take a different perspective by connecting Flow Matching to kernel density estimation. We first verify that the kernel density estimator matches the optimal rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance up to logarithmic factors, improving existing bounds for the Gaussian kernel. Based on this result, we prove that for sufficiently large networks, Flow Matching also achieves the optimal rate up to logarithmic factors, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success of this method. Finally, we provide a first justification of Flow Matching's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings by showing that rates improve when the target distribution lies on a lower-dimensional linear subspace.

Abstract: Learning to perform manipulation tasks from human videos is a promising approach for teaching robots. However, many manipulation tasks require changing control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task. To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human demonstration data -- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

Abstract: Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management. Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases, abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity (RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

Abstract: This technical report presents a comprehensive analysis of malware classification using OpCode sequences. Two distinct approaches are evaluated: traditional machine learning using n-gram analysis with Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers; and a deep learning approach employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The traditional machine learning approach establishes a baseline using handcrafted 1-gram and 2-gram features from disassembled malware samples. The deep learning methodology builds upon the work proposed in "Deep Android Malware Detection" by McLaughlin et al. and evaluates the performance of a CNN model trained to automatically extract features from raw OpCode data. Empirical results are compared using standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). While the SVM classifier outperforms other traditional techniques, the CNN model demonstrates competitive performance with the added benefit of automated feature extraction.

<title>How Learnable Grids Recover Fine Detail in Low Dimensions: A Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis of Multigrid Parametric Encodings</title>

Abstract: Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE.

Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced deep learning-based model for image segmentation of the left and right ventricles and myocardium scar tissue from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance results are described. The performance results show that this approach has attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading techniques both in DSC and HD.

Abstract: Dense ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies but are impractical to collect directly. Traditionally, displacement fields are estimated using patch matching on optical satellite images from different acquisition times. While deep learning-based optical flow models are promising, their adoption in ground deformation analysis is hindered by challenges such as the absence of real ground truth, the need for sub-pixel precision, and temporal variations due to geological or anthropogenic changes. In particular, we identify that deep learning models relying on explicit correlation layers struggle at estimating small displacements in real-world conditions. Instead, we propose a model that employs iterative refinements with explicit warping layers and a correlation-independent backbone, enabling sub-pixel precision. Additionally, a non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization preserves fault-line sharpness while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. Our model significantly outperforms widely used geophysics methods on semi-synthetic benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world scenarios captured by both medium- and high-resolution sensors.

<title>CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient comprehension of complex code.
  To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance for evaluating LLMs in code generation, outperforming the best baseline methods with average improvements of 0.202, 0.139, and 0.117 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. Besides, CodeVisionary provides detailed evaluation reports, which assist developers in identifying shortcomings and making improvements. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CodeVisionary.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid development of LEO satellite networks spurs another widespread concern-data processing at satellites. However, achieving efficient computation at LEO satellites in highly dynamic satellite networks is challenging and remains an open problem when considering the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites. For the first time, we propose a novel distributed learning framework named SFL-LEO by combining Federated Learning (FL) with Split Learning (SL) to accommodate the high dynamics of LEO satellite networks and the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites by leveraging the periodical orbit traveling feature. The proposed scheme allows training locally by introducing an asynchronous training strategy, i.e., achieving local update when LEO satellites disconnect with the ground station, to provide much more training space and thus increase the training performance. Meanwhile, it aggregates client-side sub-models at the ground station and then distributes them to LEO satellites by borrowing the idea from the federated learning scheme. Experiment results driven by satellite-ground bandwidth measured in Starlink demonstrate that SFL-LEO provides a similar accuracy performance with the conventional SL scheme because it can perform local training even within the disconnection duration.

Abstract: This systematic review discusses the methodological approaches and statistical confirmations of cross-cultural adaptations of cognitive evaluation tools used with different populations. The review considers six seminal studies on the methodology of cultural adaptation in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. The results indicate that proper adaptations need holistic models with demographic changes, and education explained as much as 26.76% of the variance in MoCA-H scores. Cultural-linguistic factors explained 6.89% of the variance in European adaptations of MoCA-H; however, another study on adapted MMSE and BCSB among Brazilian Indigenous populations reported excellent diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and specificity of 99.2%. There was 78.5% inter-rater agreement on the evaluation of cultural adaptation using the Manchester Translation Evaluation Checklist. A paramount message of the paper is that community feedback is necessary for culturally appropriate preparation, standardized translation protocols also must be included, along with robust statistical validation methodologies for developing cognitive assessment instruments. This review supplies evidence-based frameworks for the further adaptation of cognitive assessments in increasingly diverse global health settings.

<title>Filter2Noise: Interpretable Self-Supervised Single-Image Denoising for Low-Dose CT with Attention-Guided Bilateral Filtering</title>

Abstract: Effective denoising is crucial in low-dose CT to enhance subtle structures and low-contrast lesions while preventing diagnostic errors. Supervised methods struggle with limited paired datasets, and self-supervised approaches often require multiple noisy images and rely on deep networks like U-Net, offering little insight into the denoising mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable self-supervised single-image denoising framework -- Filter2Noise (F2N). Our approach introduces an Attention-Guided Bilateral Filter that adapted to each noisy input through a lightweight module that predicts spatially varying filter parameters, which can be visualized and adjusted post-training for user-controlled denoising in specific regions of interest. To enable single-image training, we introduce a novel downsampling shuffle strategy with a new self-supervised loss function that extends the concept of Noise2Noise to a single image and addresses spatially correlated noise. On the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset, F2N outperforms the leading self-supervised single-image method (ZS-N2N) by 4.59 dB PSNR while improving transparency, user control, and parametric efficiency. These features provide key advantages for medical applications that require precise and interpretable noise reduction. Our code is demonstrated at https://github.com/sypsyp97/Filter2Noise.git .

Abstract: Foundation models have recently emerged as a new paradigm in machine learning (ML). These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.

<title>SwitchMT: An Adaptive Context Switching Methodology for Scalable Multi-Task Learning in Intelligent Autonomous Agents</title>

arXiv:2504.13541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on multiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments. However, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in single-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the agents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a state-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve multi-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while enabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed context/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the scalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these limitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology for RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT employs the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active dendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to create specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that leverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in multi-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves competitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6, and Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better generalized learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of our SwitchMT methodology in addressing task interference while enabling multi-task learning automation through adaptive task switching, thereby paving the way for more efficient generalist agents with scalable multi-task learning capabilities.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is crucial for brand reputation management in the banking sector, where customer feedback spans English, Sinhala, Singlish, and code-mixed text. Existing models struggle with low-resource languages like Sinhala and lack interpretability for practical use. This research develops a hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis framework that enhances multilingual capabilities with explainable outputs. Using cleaned banking customer reviews, we fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa for Sinhala and code-mixed text, integrate domain-specific lexicon correction, and employ BERT-base-uncased for English. The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with confidence scores, while SHAP and LIME improve interpretability by providing real-time sentiment explanations. Experimental results show that our approaches outperform traditional transformer-based classifiers, achieving 92.3 percent accuracy and an F1-score of 0.89 in English and 88.4 percent in Sinhala and code-mixed content. An explainability analysis reveals key sentiment drivers, improving trust and transparency. A user-friendly interface delivers aspect-wise sentiment insights, ensuring accessibility for businesses. This research contributes to robust, transparent sentiment analysis for financial applications by bridging gaps in multilingual, low-resource NLP and explainability.

<title>Task Assignment and Exploration Optimization for Low Altitude UAV Rescue via Generative AI Enhanced Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots (GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system stability compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Soft robots exhibit inherent compliance and safety, which makes them particularly suitable for applications requiring direct physical interaction with humans, such as surgical procedures. However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions. The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including future real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human language as well as code generation, enabling the translation of high-level intents expressed by humans into low-level network configurations. In this paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro, ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks (RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F), explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all users.

To this end, we discuss approximation properties of kernel regression under minimalistic assumptions on both the kernel and the input data. We first prove error estimates in the kernel's RKHS norm. This leads us to new results concerning uniform convergence of kernel regression on compact domains. For Lipschitz continuous and H\"older continuous kernels, we prove convergence rates.

Abstract: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging, particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both PET and EHR data.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is crucial for improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use performance metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). In this paper, we show that commonly used correctness functions bias UQ evaluations by inflating the performance of certain UQ methods. We evaluate 7 correctness functions -- from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LLM-as-a-judge approaches -- across 4 datasets x 4 models x 6 UQ methods. Our analysis reveals that length biases in the errors of these correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LLM-as-a-judge approaches as among the least length-biased choices and hence a potential solution to mitigate these biases.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid framework for literature reviews that augments traditional bibliometric methods with large language models (LLMs). By fine-tuning open-source LLMs, our approach enables scalable extraction of qualitative insights from large volumes of research content, enhancing both the breadth and depth of knowledge synthesis. To improve annotation efficiency and consistency, we introduce an error-focused validation process in which LLMs generate initial labels and human reviewers correct misclassifications. Applying this framework to over 20000 scientific articles about human migration, we demonstrate that a domain-adapted LLM can serve as a "specialist" model - capable of accurately selecting relevant studies, detecting emerging trends, and identifying critical research gaps. Notably, the LLM-assisted review reveals a growing scholarly interest in climate-induced migration. However, existing literature disproportionately centers on a narrow set of environmental hazards (e.g., floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and land degradation), while overlooking others that more directly affect human health and well-being, such as air and water pollution or infectious diseases. This imbalance highlights the need for more comprehensive research that goes beyond physical environmental changes to examine their ecological and societal consequences, particularly in shaping migration as an adaptive response. Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to conduct more efficient, consistent, and insightful literature reviews across disciplines, ultimately accelerating knowledge synthesis and scientific discovery.

Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification. We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.

Abstract: Open-source intelligence provides a stream of unstructured textual data that can inform assessments of territorial control. We present CONTACT, a framework for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that LLMs fine-tuned using few-shot methods can reduce annotation burdens and support structured inference from open-ended OSINT streams. Our code is available at https://github.com/PaulKMandal/CONTACT/.

Abstract: Modern identity verification systems increasingly rely on facial images embedded in biometric documents such as electronic passports. To ensure global interoperability and security, these images must comply with strict standards defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which specify acquisition, quality, and format requirements. However, once issued, these images may undergo unintentional degradations (e.g., compression, resizing) or malicious manipulations (e.g., morphing) and deceive facial recognition systems. In this study, we explore fragile watermarking, based on deep steganographic embedding as a proactive mechanism to certify the authenticity of ICAO-compliant facial images. By embedding a hidden image within the official photo at the time of issuance, we establish an integrity marker that becomes sensitive to any post-issuance modification. We assess how a range of image manipulations affects the recovered hidden image and show that degradation artifacts can serve as robust forensic cues. Furthermore, we propose a classification framework that analyzes the revealed content to detect and categorize the type of manipulation applied. Our experiments demonstrate high detection accuracy, including cross-method scenarios with multiple deep steganography-based models. These findings support the viability of fragile watermarking via steganographic embedding as a valuable tool for biometric document integrity verification.

Abstract: We present new algorithms for estimating and testing \emph{collision probability}, a fundamental measure of the spread of a discrete distribution that is widely used in many scientific fields. We describe an algorithm that satisfies $(\alpha, \beta)$-local differential privacy and estimates collision probability with error at most $\epsilon$ using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{\log(1/\beta)}{\alpha^2 \epsilon^2}\right)$ samples for $\alpha \le 1$, which improves over previous work by a factor of $\frac{1}{\alpha^2}$. We also present a sequential testing algorithm for collision probability, which can distinguish between collision probability values that are separated by $\epsilon$ using $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ samples, even when $\epsilon$ is unknown. Our algorithms have nearly the optimal sample complexity, and in experiments we show that they require significantly fewer samples than previous methods.

<title>Can LLMs handle WebShell detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework</title>

Abstract: WebShell attacks, in which malicious scripts are injected into web servers, are a major cybersecurity threat. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are hampered by issues such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. With BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improved, with an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Larger models such as GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 14B outperform SOTA methods, while smaller models such as Qwen 2.5 3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection, and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique for transferring knowledge from complex teacher models to simpler student models, significantly enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. It has demonstrated substantial advancements in various applications including image classification, object detection, language modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis. Recent innovations in KD methods, such as attention-based approaches, block-wise logit distillation, and decoupling distillation, have notably improved student model performance. These techniques focus on stimulus complexity, attention mechanisms, and global information capture to optimize knowledge transfer. In addition, KD has proven effective in compressing large language models while preserving accuracy, reducing computational overhead, and improving inference speed. This survey synthesizes the latest literature, highlighting key findings, contributions, and future directions in knowledge distillation to provide insights for researchers and practitioners on its evolving role in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a vector-valued objective function $\boldsymbol{f}$ sampled from a Gaussian Process (GP) whose index set is a well-behaved, compact metric space $({\cal X},d)$ of designs. We assume that $\boldsymbol{f}$ is not known beforehand and that evaluating $\boldsymbol{f}$ at design $x$ results in a noisy observation of $\boldsymbol{f}(x)$. Since identifying the Pareto optimal designs via exhaustive search is infeasible when the cardinality of ${\cal X}$ is large, we propose an algorithm, called Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL, that exploits the smoothness of the GP-sampled function and the structure of $({\cal X},d)$ to learn fast. In essence, Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL employs a tree-based adaptive discretization technique to identify an $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set of designs in as few evaluations as possible. We provide both information-type and metric dimension-type bounds on the sample complexity of $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set identification. We also experimentally show that our algorithm outperforms other Pareto set identification methods.

Abstract: Off-policy learning ability is an important feature of reinforcement learning (RL) for practical applications. However, even one of the most elementary RL algorithms, temporal-difference (TD) learning, is known to suffer form divergence issue when the off-policy scheme is used together with linear function approximation. To overcome the divergent behavior, several off-policy TD-learning algorithms, including gradient-TD learning (GTD), and TD-learning with correction (TDC), have been developed until now. In this work, we provide a unified view of such algorithms from a purely control-theoretic perspective, and propose a new convergent algorithm. Our method relies on the backstepping technique, which is widely used in nonlinear control theory. Finally, convergence of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified in environments where the standard TD-learning is known to be unstable.

Abstract: Going beyond 'dendritic democracy', we introduce a 'democracy of local processors', termed Cooperator. Here we compare their capabilities when used in permutation invariant neural networks for reinforcement learning (RL), with machine learning algorithms based on Transformers, such as ChatGPT. Transformers are based on the long standing conception of integrate-and-fire 'point' neurons, whereas Cooperator is inspired by recent neurobiological breakthroughs suggesting that the cellular foundations of mental life depend on context-sensitive pyramidal neurons in the neocortex which have two functionally distinct points. Weshow that when used for RL, an algorithm based on Cooperator learns far quicker than that based on Transformer, even while having the same number of parameters.

Abstract: The explicit incorporation of task-specific inductive biases through symmetry has emerged as a general design precept in the development of high-performance machine learning models. For example, group equivariant neural networks have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains and applications such as protein and drug design. A prevalent intuition about such models is that the integration of relevant symmetry results in enhanced generalization. Moreover, it is posited that when the data and/or the model may only exhibit $\textit{approximate}$ or $\textit{partial}$ symmetry, the optimal or best-performing model is one where the model symmetry aligns with the data symmetry. In this paper, we conduct a formal unified investigation of these intuitions. To begin, we present general quantitative bounds that demonstrate how models capturing task-specific symmetries lead to improved generalization. In fact, our results do not require the transformations to be finite or even form a group and can work with partial or approximate equivariance. Utilizing this quantification, we examine the more general question of model mis-specification i.e. when the model symmetries don't align with the data symmetries. We establish, for a given symmetry group, a quantitative comparison between the approximate/partial equivariance of the model and that of the data distribution, precisely connecting model equivariance error and data equivariance error. Our result delineates conditions under which the model equivariance error is optimal, thereby yielding the best-performing model for the given task and data. Our results are the most general results of their type in the literature.

Abstract: Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art optimizers are adaptive gradient-based optimization methods such as Adam. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in formulating gradient-based optimizers in a probabilistic framework for better modeling the uncertainty of the gradients. Here, we propose to combine both approaches, resulting in the Variational Stochastic Gradient Descent (VSGD) optimizer. We model gradient updates as a probabilistic model and utilize stochastic variational inference (SVI) to derive an efficient and effective update rule. Further, we show how our VSGD method relates to other adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam. Lastly, we carry out experiments on two image classification datasets and four deep neural network architectures, where we show that VSGD outperforms Adam and SGD.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the MallowsPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities. MallowsPO is also compatible with other SOTA offline preference optimization methods, boosting nearly 2\% extra LC win rate when used as a plugin for fine-tuning Llama3-Instruct.

Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a surprising capability of large language models (LLMs): given only input feature names and a description of a prediction task, they are capable of selecting the most predictive features, with performance rivaling the standard tools of data science. Remarkably, these models exhibit this capacity across various query mechanisms. For example, we zero-shot prompt an LLM to output a numerical importance score for a feature (e.g., "blood pressure") in predicting an outcome of interest (e.g., "heart failure"), with no additional context. In particular, we find that the latest models, such as GPT-4, can consistently identify the most predictive features regardless of the query mechanism and across various prompting strategies. We illustrate these findings through extensive experiments on real-world data, where we show that LLM-based feature selection consistently achieves strong performance competitive with data-driven methods such as the LASSO, despite never having looked at the downstream training data. Our findings suggest that LLMs may be useful not only for selecting the best features for training but also for deciding which features to collect in the first place. This could benefit practitioners in domains like healthcare and the social sciences, where collecting high-quality data comes at a high cost.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of noise in training datasets for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. We categorize noise into pointwise noise, which includes low-quality data points, and pairwise noise, which encompasses erroneous data pair associations that affect preference rankings. Utilizing Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), we enhance DPO's resilience to these types of noise. Our theoretical insights reveal that DPO inherently embeds DRO principles, conferring robustness to pointwise noise, with the regularization coefficient $\beta$ playing a critical role in its noise resistance. Extending this framework, we introduce Distributionally Robustifying DPO (Dr. DPO), which integrates pairwise robustness by optimizing against worst-case pairwise scenarios. The novel hyperparameter $\beta'$ in Dr. DPO allows for fine-tuned control over data pair reliability, providing a strategic balance between exploration and exploitation in noisy training environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Dr. DPO substantially improves the quality of generated text and response accuracy in preference datasets, showcasing enhanced performance in both noisy and noise-free settings. The code is available at https://github.com/junkangwu/Dr_DPO.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex, nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they face challenges such as high memory requirements and computational costs with limited interpretability. This paper introduces an approach where master equations of physics are converted into multilayered networks that are trained via backpropagation. The resulting general-purpose model effectively encodes data in the properties of the underlying physical system. In contrast to existing methods wherein a trained neural network is used as a computationally efficient alternative for solving physical equations, our approach directly treats physics equations as trainable models. We demonstrate this physical embedding concept with the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE), which acts as trainable architecture for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. The network embeds data representation in orders of magnitude fewer parameters than conventional neural networks when tested on time series data. Notably, the trained "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network" is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings. This interpretability offers insight into the underlying dynamics of the system that produced the data. The proposed method of replacing traditional DNN feature learning architectures with physical equations is also extended to the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework to other master equations of physics. Among our results, an ablation study quantifies the relative importance of physical terms such as dispersion, nonlinearity, and potential energy for classification accuracy. We also outline the limitations of this approach as it relates to generalizability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Typically, LLMs are first pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during fine-tuning, LLMs may forget some knowledge acquired in the pre-training stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. Existing approaches to mitigate forgetting often rely on access to pre-training data, which may be unavailable in many real-world scenarios--such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). MoFO is an extension of greedy block coordinate descent (BCD) methods: in each iteration, MoFO only updates the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes, while keeping all other parameters fixed. MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance to the default fine-tuning algorithm while effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating forgetting without pre-training data.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates linear programming (LP) within the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed approach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming problem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere to these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not only preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it particularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning scenarios.

Abstract: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.
  To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the rise to dominance of deep learning in unstructured data domains, tree-based methods such as Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) are still the workhorses for handling discriminative tasks on tabular data. We explore generative extensions of these popular algorithms with a focus on explicitly modeling the data density (up to a normalization constant), thus enabling other applications besides sampling. As our main contribution we propose an energy-based generative boosting algorithm that is analogous to the second-order boosting implemented in popular libraries like XGBoost. We show that, despite producing a generative model capable of handling inference tasks over any input variable, our proposed algorithm can achieve similar discriminative performance to GBDT on a number of real world tabular datasets, outperforming alternative generative approaches. At the same time, we show that it is also competitive with neural-network-based models for sampling. Code is available at https://github.com/ajoo/nrgboost.

Abstract: On Efficient and Scalable Computation of the Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimator in Mixture ModelsTwin support vector machine (TSVM) is an emerging machine learning model with versatile applicability in classification and regression endeavors. Nevertheless, TSVM confronts noteworthy challenges: $(i)$ the imperative demand for matrix inversions presents formidable obstacles to its efficiency and applicability on large-scale datasets; $(ii)$ the omission of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle in its primal formulation heightens the vulnerability to overfitting risks; and $(iii)$ the TSVM exhibits a high susceptibility to noise and outliers, and also demonstrates instability when subjected to resampling. In view of the aforementioned challenges, we propose the granular ball twin support vector machine (GBTSVM). GBTSVM takes granular balls, rather than individual data points, as inputs to construct a classifier. These granular balls, characterized by their coarser granularity, exhibit robustness to resampling and reduced susceptibility to the impact of noise and outliers. We further propose a novel large-scale granular ball twin support vector machine (LS-GBTSVM). LS-GBTSVM's optimization formulation ensures two critical facets: $(i)$ it eliminates the need for matrix inversions, streamlining the LS-GBTSVM's computational efficiency, and $(ii)$ it incorporates the SRM principle through the incorporation of regularization terms, effectively addressing the issue of overfitting. The proposed LS-GBTSVM exemplifies efficiency, scalability for large datasets, and robustness against noise and outliers. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the GBTSVM and LS-GBTSVM models on benchmark datasets from UCI, KEEL, and NDC datasets. Our experimental findings and statistical analyses affirm the superior generalization prowess of the proposed GBTSVM and LS-GBTSVM models.

Abstract: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.

Abstract: Large language models of high parameter counts are computationally expensive, yet can be made much more efficient by compressing their weights to very low numerical precision. This can be achieved either through post-training quantization by minimizing local, layer-wise quantization errors, or through quantization-aware fine-tuning by minimizing the global loss function. In this study, we discovered that, under the same data constraint, the former approach nearly always fared worse than the latter, a phenomenon particularly prominent when the numerical precision is very low. We further showed that this difficulty of post-training quantization arose from stark misalignment between optimization of the local and global objective functions. Our findings explains limited utility in minimization of local quantization error and the importance of direct quantization-aware fine-tuning, in the regime of large models at very low precision.

<title>Robust Universum Twin Support Vector Machine for Imbalanced Data</title>

Abstract: One of the major difficulties in machine learning methods is categorizing datasets that are imbalanced. This problem may lead to biased models, where the training process is dominated by the majority class, resulting in inadequate representation of the minority class. Universum twin support vector machine (UTSVM) produces a biased model towards the majority class, as a result, its performance on the minority class is often poor as it might be mistakenly classified as noise. Moreover, UTSVM is not proficient in handling datasets that contain outliers and noises. Inspired by the concept of incorporating prior information about the data and employing an intuitionistic fuzzy membership scheme, we propose intuitionistic fuzzy UTSVM for imbalanced data (IFUTSVM-ID) by enhancing overall robustness. We use an intuitionistic fuzzy membership scheme to mitigate the impact of noise and outliers. Moreover, to tackle the problem of imbalanced class distribution, data oversampling and undersampling methods are utilized. Prior knowledge about the data is provided by universum data. This leads to better generalization performance. UTSVM is susceptible to overfitting risks due to the omission of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle in their primal formulations. However, the proposed IFUTSVM-ID model incorporates the SRM principle through the incorporation of regularization terms, effectively addressing the issue of overfitting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID model on benchmark datasets from KEEL and compare it with existing baseline models. Furthermore, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID model in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), we applied them to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID models compared to the baseline models.

<title>ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

<title>Subgraph Aggregation for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has gained significant attention due to its critical importance in graph-based predictions in real-world scenarios. Existing methods primarily focus on extracting a single causal subgraph from the input graph to achieve generalizable predictions. However, relying on a single subgraph can lead to susceptibility to spurious correlations and is insufficient for learning invariant patterns behind graph data. Moreover, in many real-world applications, such as molecular property prediction, multiple critical subgraphs may influence the target label property. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, SubGraph Aggregation (SuGAr), designed to learn a diverse set of subgraphs that are crucial for OOD generalization on graphs. Specifically, SuGAr employs a tailored subgraph sampler and diversity regularizer to extract a diverse set of invariant subgraphs. These invariant subgraphs are then aggregated by averaging their representations, which enriches the subgraph signals and enhances coverage of the underlying causal structures, thereby improving OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 24% improvement in OOD generalization on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study graph OOD generalization by learning multiple invariant subgraphs. code: https://github.com/Nanolbw/SuGAr

<title>Few-shot Model Extraction Attacks against Sequential Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Among adversarial attacks against sequential recommender systems, model extraction attacks represent a method to attack sequential recommendation models without prior knowledge. Existing research has primarily concentrated on the adversary's execution of black-box attacks through data-free model extraction. However, a significant gap remains in the literature concerning the development of surrogate models by adversaries with access to few-shot raw data (10\% even less). That is, the challenge of how to construct a surrogate model with high functional similarity within the context of few-shot data scenarios remains an issue that requires resolution.This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel few-shot model extraction framework against sequential recommenders, which is designed to construct a superior surrogate model with the utilization of few-shot data. The proposed few-shot model extraction framework is comprised of two components: an autoregressive augmentation generation strategy and a bidirectional repair loss-facilitated model distillation procedure. Specifically, to generate synthetic data that closely approximate the distribution of raw data, autoregressive augmentation generation strategy integrates a probabilistic interaction sampler to extract inherent dependencies and a synthesis determinant signal module to characterize user behavioral patterns. Subsequently, bidirectional repair loss, which target the discrepancies between the recommendation lists, is designed as auxiliary loss to rectify erroneous predictions from surrogate models, transferring knowledge from the victim model to the surrogate model effectively. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed few-shot model extraction framework yields superior surrogate models.

<title>Order is All You Need for Categorical Data Clustering</title>

Abstract: Categorical data composed of qualitative valued attributes are ubiquitous in machine learning tasks. Due to the lack of well-defined metric space, categorical data distributions are difficult to be intuitively understood. Clustering is a popular data analysis technique suitable for data distribution understanding. However, the success of clustering often relies on reasonable distance metrics, which happens to be what categorical data naturally lack. This paper therefore introduces a new finding that the order relation among attribute values is the decisive factor in clustering accuracy, and is also the key to understanding categorical data clusters, because the essence of clustering is to order the clusters in terms of their admission to samples. To obtain the orders, we propose a new learning paradigm that allows joint learning of clusters and the orders. It alternatively partitions the data into clusters based on the distance metric built upon the orders and estimates the most likely orders according to the clusters. The algorithm achieves superior clustering accuracy with a convergence guarantee, and the learned orders facilitate the understanding of the non-intuitive cluster distribution of categorical data. Extensive experiments with ablation studies, statistical evidence, and case studies have validated the new insight into the importance of value order and the method proposition.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in vehicle control by guiding agents to learn optimal control strategies through designing or learning appropriate reward signals. However, in vehicle control applications, rewards typically need to be manually designed while considering multiple implicit factors, which easily introduces human biases. Although imitation learning methods does not rely on explicit reward signals, they necessitate high-quality expert actions, which are often challenging to acquire. To address these issues, we propose a reward-free reinforcement learning framework (RFRLF). This framework directly learns the target states to optimize agent behavior through a target state prediction network (TSPN) and a reward-free state-guided policy network (RFSGPN), avoiding the dependence on manually designed reward signals. Specifically, the policy network is learned via minimizing the differences between the predicted state and the expert state. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RFRLF in controlling vehicle driving, showing its advantages in improving learning efficiency and adapting to reward-free environments.

Abstract: Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We propose a new idea for the community to adopt: convert scholarly documents into knowledge preserving, but style agnostic representations we term Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95\%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.

Abstract: We address the problem of active logistic regression in the realizable setting. It is well known that active learning can require exponentially fewer label queries compared to passive learning, in some cases using $\log \frac{1}{\eps}$ rather than $\poly(1/\eps)$ labels to get error $\eps$ larger than the optimum.
  We present the first algorithm that is polynomially competitive with the optimal algorithm on every input instance, up to factors polylogarithmic in the error and domain size. In particular, if any algorithm achieves label complexity polylogarithmic in $\eps$, so does ours. Our algorithm is based on efficient sampling and can be extended to learn more general class of functions. We further support our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating performance gains for logistic regression compared to existing active learning algorithms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has significantly improved large language model performance, enabling deeper reasoning to solve complex problems. However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Reason Bench (DNR Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNR Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNR Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in Lithium ion battery (LIB) health management systems is essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. However, many existing methods assume that training and testing data follow the same distribution, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen target domains. To address this, we propose a novel RUL prediction framework that incorporates a domain adaptation (DA) technique. Our framework integrates a signal preprocessing pipeline including noise reduction, feature extraction, and normalization with a robust deep learning model called HybridoNet Adapt. The model features a combination of LSTM, Multihead Attention, and Neural ODE layers for feature extraction, followed by two predictor modules with trainable trade-off parameters. To improve generalization, we adopt a DA strategy inspired by Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), replacing adversarial loss with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to learn domain-invariant features. Experimental results show that HybridoNet Adapt significantly outperforms traditional models such as XGBoost and Elastic Net, as well as deep learning baselines like Dual input DNN, demonstrating its potential for scalable and reliable battery health management (BHM).

Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.

Abstract: Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its different application scenarios. However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.

Abstract: At the current stage, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated excellent capabilities in evaluating aerodynamic performance, significantly reducing the time and cost required for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. However, when faced with the task of processing extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) vehicle models, the lack of large-scale datasets and training resources, coupled with the inherent diversity and complexity of the geometry of different vehicle models, means that the prediction accuracy and versatility of these networks are still not up to the level required for current production. In view of the remarkable success of Transformer models in the field of natural language processing and their strong potential in the field of image processing, this study innovatively proposes a point cloud learning framework called DrivAer Transformer (DAT). The DAT structure uses the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which contains high-fidelity CFD data of industrial-standard 3D vehicle shapes. enabling accurate estimation of air drag directly from 3D meshes, thus avoiding the limitations of traditional methods such as 2D image rendering or signed distance fields (SDF). DAT enables fast and accurate drag prediction, driving the evolution of the aerodynamic evaluation process and laying the critical foundation for introducing a data-driven approach to automotive design. The framework is expected to accelerate the vehicle design process and improve development efficiency.

Abstract: Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).

Abstract: Sponge examples are test-time inputs optimized to increase energy consumption and prediction latency of deep networks deployed on hardware accelerators. By increasing the fraction of neurons activated during classification, these attacks reduce sparsity in network activation patterns, worsening the performance of hardware accelerators. In this work, we present a novel training-time attack, named sponge poisoning, which aims to worsen energy consumption and prediction latency of neural networks on any test input without affecting classification accuracy. To stage this attack, we assume that the attacker can control only a few model updates during training -- a likely scenario, e.g., when model training is outsourced to an untrusted third party or distributed via federated learning. Our extensive experiments on image classification tasks show that sponge poisoning is effective, and that fine-tuning poisoned models to repair them poses prohibitive costs for most users, highlighting that tackling sponge poisoning remains an open issue.

In this work, we provide evidence that the saddle points problem can be naturally avoided in variational quantum algorithms by exploiting the presence of stochasticity. We prove convergence guarantees and present practical examples in numerical simulations and on quantum hardware. We argue that the natural stochasticity of variational algorithms can be beneficial for avoiding strict saddle points, i.e., those saddle points with at least one negative Hessian eigenvalue. This insight that some levels of shot noise could help is expected to add a new perspective to notions of near-term variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Typical machine learning regression applications aim to report the mean or the median of the predictive probability distribution, via training with a squared or an absolute error scoring function. The importance of issuing predictions of more functionals of the predictive probability distribution (quantiles and expectiles) has been recognized as a means to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. In deep learning (DL) applications, that is possible through quantile and expectile regression neural networks (QRNN and ERNN respectively). Here we introduce deep Huber quantile regression networks (DHQRN) that nest QRNN and ERNN as edge cases. DHQRN can predict Huber quantiles, which are more general functionals in the sense that they nest quantiles and expectiles as limiting cases. The main idea is to train a DL algorithm with the Huber quantile scoring function, which is consistent for the Huber quantile functional. As a proof of concept, DHQRN are applied to predict house prices in Melbourne, Australia and Boston, United States (US). In this context, predictive performances of three DL architectures are discussed along with evidential interpretation of results from two economic case studies. Additional simulation experiments and applications to real-world case studies using open datasets demonstrate a satisfactory absolute performance of DHQRN.

Abstract: Hesitant fuzzy sets find extensive application in specific scenarios involving uncertainty and hesitation. In the context of set theory, the concept of inclusion relationship holds significant importance as a fundamental definition. Consequently, as a type of sets, hesitant fuzzy sets necessitate a clear and explicit definition of the inclusion relationship. Based on the discrete form of hesitant fuzzy membership degrees, this study proposes multiple types of inclusion relationships for hesitant fuzzy sets. Subsequently, this paper introduces foundational propositions related to hesitant fuzzy sets, as well as propositions concerning families of hesitant fuzzy sets.

<title>Algorithms for mean-field variational inference via polyhedral optimization in the Wasserstein space</title>

arXiv:2312.02849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of finite-dimensional polyhedral subsets over the Wasserstein space and optimization of functionals over them via first-order methods. Our main application is to the problem of mean-field variational inference, which seeks to approximate a distribution $\pi$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a product measure $\pi^\star$. When $\pi$ is strongly log-concave and log-smooth, we provide (1) approximation rates certifying that $\pi^\star$ is close to the minimizer $\pi^\star_\diamond$ of the KL divergence over a \emph{polyhedral} set $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$, and (2) an algorithm for minimizing $\text{KL}(\cdot\|\pi)$ over $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$ based on accelerated gradient descent over $\R^d$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first end-to-end analysis for gradient-based algorithms for MFVI.

<title>Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2404.02151v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a 100% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we provide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.

<title>Is In-Context Learning Sufficient for Instruction Following in LLMs?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2405.19874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights: this is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples. Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance. In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on the established benchmark MT-Bench, especially with more capable base LLMs. We then uncover the most relevant elements for successful in-context alignment, finding the crucial role of the decoding parameters. Based on these insights, we show that the approach of URIAL can indeed be improved by adding high-quality, potentially carefully selected via greedy search, demonstrations in context, getting closer to the performance of instruct models. Finally, we provide the first, to our knowledge, systematic comparison of ICL and instruction fine-tuning (IFT) for instruction following in the low data regime, where ICL can be a viable alternative to IFT. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique and its relationship to IFT. We provide our code at https://github.com/tml-epfl/icl-alignment.

<title>VCR: A Task for Pixel-Level Complex Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Restoring Occluded Text</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06462</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2406.06462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.

<title>NeuroNAS: Enhancing Efficiency of Neuromorphic In-Memory Computing for Intelligent Mobile Agents through Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture Search</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00641</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2407.00641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent mobile agents (e.g., UGVs and UAVs) typically demand low power/energy consumption when solving their machine learning (ML)-based tasks, since they are usually powered by portable batteries with limited capacity. A potential solution is employing neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which leverages event-based computation to enable ultra-low power/energy ML algorithms. To maximize the performance efficiency of SNN inference, the In-Memory Computing (IMC)-based hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) can be employed. However, SNN models are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying IMC hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energyefficient neuromorphic IMC for intelligent mobile agents using hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Its key steps include: optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, NeuroNAS quickly finds SNN architectures (with 8bit weight precision) that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency improvements, 84% energy savings across different datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200); while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once.

<title>Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11969</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2407.11969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended. We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense.

<title>Enabling Fast and Accurate Crowdsourced Annotation for Elevation-Aware Flood Extent Mapping</title>

Abstract: Mapping the extent of flood events is a necessary and important aspect of disaster management. In recent years, deep learning methods have evolved as an effective tool to quickly label high resolution imagery and provide necessary flood extent mappings. These methods, though, require large amounts of annotated training data to create models that are accurate and robust to new flooded imagery. In this work, we present FloodTrace, a web-based application that enables effective crowdsourcing of flooded region annotation for machine learning applications. To create this application, we conducted extensive interviews with domain experts to produce a set of formal requirements. Our work brings topological segmentation tools to the web and greatly improves annotation efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. The user-friendliness of our solution allows researchers to outsource annotations to non-experts and utilize them to produce training data with equal quality to fully expert-labeled data. We conducted a user study to confirm the effectiveness of our application in which 266 graduate students annotated high-resolution aerial imagery from Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina. Experimental results show the efficiency benefits of our application for untrained users, with median annotation time less than half the state-of-the-art annotation method. In addition, using our aggregation and correction framework, flood detection models trained on crowdsourced annotations were able to achieve performance equal to models trained on fully expert-labeled annotations, while requiring a fraction of the time on the part of the expert.

Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires a detailed analysis of protein structures and functions, a task that is inherently complex and time-consuming in traditional protein research. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multimodal large language model for proteins that enables users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers to ensure precise representation adaptation and leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we constructed a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins, each annotated with 20-30 property tags and 5-10 QA pairs per protein, and optimized the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. Experiments demonstrate that ProteinGPT effectively generates informative responses to protein-related questions, achieving high performance on both semantic and lexical metrics and significantly outperforming baseline models and general-purpose LLMs in understanding and responding to protein-related queries. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ProteinGPT/ProteinGPT.

<title>Symmetry-Based Structured Matrices for Efficient Approximately Equivariant Networks</title>

arXiv:2409.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in designing neural networks (NNs) with relaxed equivariance, which interpolate between exact equivariance and full flexibility for consistent performance gains. In a separate line of work, structured parameter matrices with low displacement rank (LDR) -- which permit fast function and gradient evaluation -- have been used to create compact NNs, though primarily benefiting classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a framework based on symmetry-based structured matrices to build approximately equivariant NNs with fewer parameters. Our approach unifies the aforementioned areas using Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design of structured matrices similar to LDR matrices, which can generalize all the elementary operations of a CNN from cyclic groups to arbitrary finite groups. We show GMs can also generalize classical LDR theory to general discrete groups, enabling a natural formalism for approximate equivariance. We test GM-based architectures on various tasks with relaxed symmetry and find that our framework performs competitively with approximately equivariant NNs and other structured matrix-based methods, often with one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting recreational angler effort is important for sustainable fisheries management. However, conventional methods of measuring angler effort, such as surveys, can be costly and limited in both time and spatial extent. Models that predict angler effort based on environmental or economic factors typically rely on historical data, which often limits their spatial and temporal generalizability due to data scarcity. In this study, high-resolution data from an online fishing platform and easily accessible auxiliary data were tested to predict daily boat presence and aerial counts of boats at almost 200 lakes over five years in Ontario, Canada. Lake-information website visits alone enabled predicting daily angler boat presence with 78% accuracy. While incorporating additional environmental, socio-ecological, weather and angler-reported features into machine learning models did not remarkably improve prediction performance of boat presence, they were substantial for the prediction of boat counts. Models achieved an R2 of up to 0.77 at known lakes included in the model training, but they performed poorly for unknown lakes (R2 = 0.21). The results demonstrate the value of integrating data from online fishing platforms into predictive models and highlight the potential of machine learning models to enhance fisheries management.

Abstract: We present generalized versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems with the probabilities being transported replaced by lower probabilities. We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated sets, then our version of Monge's, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich's problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich's optimal plan, and for the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations the lower probability versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also discussed.

Abstract: Not yet. We present SPACE, a benchmark that systematically evaluates spatial cognition in frontier models. Our benchmark builds on decades of research in cognitive science. It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models. Results suggest that contemporary frontier models fall short of the spatial intelligence of animals, performing near chance level on a number of classic tests of animal cognition.

Abstract: We now deploy language models in a wide variety of user-facing applications. Typically, these deployments have some specific purpose, like answering questions about documentation or acting as coding assistants, but they require general language understanding. Under these circumstances these models should not be able to answer irrelevant requests such as, poetry generation or questions about physics, etc. Instead we would like language models to only answer to queries corresponding to desired behavior and refuse all other requests, which we refer to as scoping. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of potential methods from prompting to fine-tuning to preference learning to a recently proposed method for general alignment called Circuit Breakers (CB). Across three families of language models and a broad variety of tasks, we show that it is possible to scope language models. We examine scoping for multiple topics, and fine-grained topics. We ablate diversity of irrelevant queries, layer different techniques, conduct adversarial evaluations and more. Among other results, we find that, when diverse examples of irrelevant queries are available, simple supervised fine-tuning produces the best results, but when such diversity is low, Circuit Breakers perform quite well. One can often get the benefits of both methods by layering them in succession. We intend our study to serve as a practitioner's guide to scoping language models.

Abstract: Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets. Our loss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.

<title>PriorDiffusion: Leverage Language Prior in Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisance. We argue that language prior can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the inductive bias learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. The ability of these models to generate images that align with text indicates that they have learned the spatial relationships, size, and shape of specified objects, which can be applied to improve depth estimation. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both images and corresponding text descriptions to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language prior enhances the model's perception of specific regions of images that users care about and describe. Simultaneously, language prior acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve faster training convergence, fewer inference diffusion steps, and state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Human motion is inherently continuous and dynamic, posing significant challenges for generative models. While discrete generation methods are widely used, they suffer from limited expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. In contrast, continuous approaches produce smoother, more natural motion but often struggle to adhere to conditioning signals due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this discord between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that leverages rectified flow to decode discrete motion tokens in the continuous, raw motion space. Our core idea is to frame token decoding as a conditional generation task, ensuring that DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and achieves smoother, more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals on diverse settings.

arXiv:2412.00383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities across a variety of tasks. Fine-tuning these models for specific domains, particularly through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies like LoRA, has become a prevalent practice due to its efficiency. However, this raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models may inadvertently retain and disseminate sensitive or undesirable information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel instance-wise unlearning framework, LLMEraser, which systematically categorizes unlearning tasks and applies precise parameter adjustments using influence functions. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that are often limited in scope and require extensive retraining, LLMEraser is designed to handle a broad spectrum of unlearning tasks without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LLMEraser excels in efficiently managing various unlearning scenarios while maintaining the overall integrity and efficacy of the models.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, MultiShield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. MultiShield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that MultiShield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.

Abstract: The field of self-supervised learning (SSL) for 3D medical images lacks consistency and standardization. While many methods have been developed, it is impossible to identify the current state-of-the-art, due to i) varying and small pretraining datasets, ii) varying architectures, and iii) being evaluated on differing downstream datasets. In this paper, we bring clarity to this field and lay the foundation for further method advancements through three key contributions: We a) publish the largest publicly available pre-training dataset comprising 114k 3D brain MRI volumes, enabling all practitioners to pre-train on a large-scale dataset. We b) benchmark existing 3D self-supervised learning methods on this dataset for a state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer architecture, clarifying the state of 3D SSL pre-training. Among many findings, we show that pre-trained methods can exceed a strong from-scratch nnU-Net ResEnc-L baseline. Lastly, we c) publish the code of our pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks and provide the pre-trained models created during the benchmarking process to facilitate rapid adoption and reproduction.

Abstract: Recently, Cella and Martin proved how, under an assumption called consonance, a credal set (i.e. a closed and convex set of probabilities) can be derived from the conformal transducer associated with transductive conformal prediction. We show that the Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) associated with such a credal set corresponds to the classical Conformal Prediction Region. In proving this result, we establish a new relationship between Conformal Prediction and Imprecise Probability (IP) theories, via the IP concept of a cloud. A byproduct of our presentation is the discovery that consonant plausibility functions are monoid homomorphisms, a new algebraic property of an IP tool.

Abstract: Many works have investigated reinforcement learning (RL) for routing and spectrum assignment on flex-grid networks but only one work to date has examined RL for fixed-grid with flex-rate transponders, despite production systems using this paradigm. Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is concerned with how intelligence agents take actions in a given environment to maximize the cumulative reward they receive. In healthcare, applying RL algorithms could assist patients in improving their health status. In ride-sharing platforms, applying RL algorithms could increase drivers' income and customer satisfaction. For large language models, applying RL algorithms could align their outputs with human preferences. Over the past decade, RL has been arguably one of the most vibrant research frontiers in machine learning. Nevertheless, statistics as a field, as opposed to computer science, has only recently begun to engage with RL both in depth and in breadth. This chapter presents a selective review of statistical inferential tools for RL, covering both hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Our goal is to highlight the value of statistical inference in RL for both the statistics and machine learning communities, and to promote the broader application of classical statistical inference tools in this vibrant area of research.

arXiv:2502.16542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loss functions constructed by applying transformations to the realization and prediction variables of (strictly) consistent loss functions have been extensively studied empirically, yet their theoretical foundations remain unexplored. To address this gap, we establish formal characterizations of (strict) consistency for such transformed loss functions and their corresponding elicitable functionals. Our analysis focuses on two interrelated cases: (a) transformations applied solely to the realization variable and (b) bijective transformations applied jointly to both the realization and prediction variables. These cases extend the well-established framework of transformations applied exclusively to the prediction variable, as formalized by Osband's revelation principle. We further develop analogous characterizations for (strict) identification functions. The resulting theoretical framework is broadly applicable to statistical and machine learning methodologies. When applied to Bregman and expectile loss functions, our framework enables two key advancements: (a) the interpretation of empirical findings from models trained with transformed loss functions and (b) the systematic construction of novel identifiable and elicitable functionals, including the g-transformed expectation and g-transformed expectile. By unifying theoretical insights with practical applications, this work advances principled methodologies for designing loss functions in complex predictive tasks. Applications of the framework to simulated and real-world data illustrate its practical utility in diverse settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.

arXiv:2503.17140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful tool for approximating quantum wavefunctions using deep learning. While these models achieve remarkable accuracy, understanding how they encode physical information remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce adiabatic fine-tuning, a scheme that trains NQS across a phase diagram, leading to strongly correlated weight representations across different models. This correlation in weight space enables the detection of phase transitions in quantum systems by analyzing the trained network weights alone. We validate our approach on the transverse field Ising model and the J1-J2 Heisenberg model, demonstrating that phase transitions manifest as distinct structures in weight space. Our results establish a connection between physical phase transitions and the geometry of neural network parameters, opening new directions for the interpretability of machine learning models in physics.

<title>Minimax Optimal Convergence of Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression via Large and Adaptive Stepsizes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04105</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.04105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\textit{gradient descent}$ (GD) for logistic regression on linearly separable data with stepsizes that adapt to the current risk, scaled by a constant hyperparameter $\eta$. We show that after at most $1/\gamma^2$ burn-in steps, GD achieves a risk upper bounded by $\exp(-\Theta(\eta))$, where $\gamma$ is the margin of the dataset. As $\eta$ can be arbitrarily large, GD attains an arbitrarily small risk $\textit{immediately after the burn-in steps}$, though the risk evolution may be $\textit{non-monotonic}$.
  We further construct hard datasets with margin $\gamma$, where any batch (or online) first-order method requires $\Omega(1/\gamma^2)$ steps to find a linear separator. Thus, GD with large, adaptive stepsizes is $\textit{minimax optimal}$ among first-order batch methods. Notably, the classical $\textit{Perceptron}$ (Novikoff, 1962), a first-order online method, also achieves a step complexity of $1/\gamma^2$, matching GD even in constants.
  Finally, our GD analysis extends to a broad class of loss functions and certain two-layer networks.

Abstract: High-quality code documentation is crucial for software development especially in the era of AI. However, generating it automatically using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, as existing approaches often produce incomplete, unhelpful, or factually incorrect outputs. We introduce DocAgent, a novel multi-agent collaborative system using topological code processing for incremental context building. Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently. Our ablation study confirms the vital role of the topological processing order. DocAgent offers a robust approach for reliable code documentation generation in complex and proprietary repositories.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach to understanding the collaboration patterns among experts in Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs). By employing hierarchical sparse dictionary learning (HSDL), the study effectively identifies the specific input types that experts collaborate on and uncovers their semantic significance across various tasks. Additionally, the Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm is proposed to optimize MoE LLMs by removing low-contribution experts. Experimental results demonstrate that expert collaboration patterns are closely tied to input types and pruning low-contribution experts can enhance overall performance by 2.5% on average, surpassing existing methods. These findings shed light on how expert interactions influence model efficiency and interpretability, ultimately improving model optimization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues: (1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average, outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

<div> Keywords: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), data-driven customization, multiturn setting, Activated LoRA (aLoRA), intrinsics models <br />
Summary: 
Activated LoRA (aLoRA) is introduced as an improved framework for finetuning large foundation models such as LoRA, allowing for efficient adaptation of weights in multiturn settings. Unlike LoRA, aLoRA only adjusts token weights after activation, eliminating the need to recompute key-value caches for each turn. This enables the use of specialized intrinsics models that can be instantly activated for specific operations within a conversation chain. By training a set of intrinsics models using aLoRA, competitive accuracy with standard LoRA is achieved while significantly improving inference efficiency. The innovation of aLoRA lies in its ability to streamline the adaptation process and enable quick customization of model behavior without redundant computations. <div>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

In the paper titled "Scaling Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Objectives for Multi-Objective Optimization," the authors address the challenge of effectively balancing multiple objectives in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. They propose a novel technique that involves scaling QUBO objectives to have unit variance, thereby aligning them onto a common scale. This approach allows for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the objectives with equal weights and can aid in the selection of appropriate weights during scalarization. Through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective optimization problems, the advantages of this technique are demonstrated, highlighting its efficacy in solving multi-objective optimization problems where manually selecting scalarization weights is challenging and efficient solutions are limited.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are scarce.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships. The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras .h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting accountability.

Summary: <br />
The paper explores the use of Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. Synthetic datasets with known spatially varying and nonlinear effects are generated across different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors from various spatial weights matrices are tested with popular machine learning models like Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet. The accuracies of these models, measured in cross-validated R2 values, are compared to models using only location coordinates as features. Results indicate that models relying solely on coordinates outperform eigenvector-based approaches in various experiments and datasets. The study suggests that while eigenvectors may not be as effective for spatial processes with positive autocorrelation, they could still have utility in modeling network autocorrelation and scenarios with negative spatial autocorrelation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran Eigenvectors would still be useful.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors address the crucial issue of fairness in machine learning, particularly focusing on mitigating discrimination against marginalized groups. They propose a novel approach that incorporates subgroup justice concepts into gradient-boosting machines for supervised learning tasks. By expanding the traditional gradient-boosting methodologies to include a min-max fairness term in the objective function, the algorithm can now address a wider range of fairness considerations. The authors investigate the theoretical properties of the min-max optimization problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through theoretical proofs and empirical experiments. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting algorithm is shown to converge under mild conditions and offers a flexible solution for achieving both binary and subgroup fairness in predictive models. This work highlights the importance of incorporating fairness considerations into machine learning algorithms to ensure equitable outcomes across different demographic groups. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and subgroup fairness.

Summary: 
Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer pretraining due to its sparse routing mechanism. However, sparse backward updates can cause training instability and suboptimal performance. To address this issue, a lightweight approximation method called Default MoE is introduced. This method provides the MoE router with dense gradient updates while maintaining sparse parameter activation. By filling in missing expert activations with default outputs derived from an exponential moving average of past outputs, the router can receive signals from all experts for each input token. Default MoE shows significant improvements over standard TopK routing in various scenarios, without incurring notable computational overhead. This approach enhances training performance by enabling the router to access information from all experts, leading to better overall results. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer. Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of training on diverse or representative inputs.

<br />
Summary:
The paper introduces the Distributed Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework to optimize fine-tuning for foundation models in distributed computing environments. D2FT strategically orchestrates operations across attention modules, reducing computational workload by 40% and communication costs by 50% with minimal accuracy drops. Three selection strategies are employed to efficiently distribute computation, addressing workload imbalances. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of D2FT in reducing training costs while maintaining accuracy. The framework is also extended to LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, showing a 4% to 6% accuracy drop on the Stanford Cars dataset with reduced computational and communication costs. D2FT leverages the foundation nature of models to optimize fine-tuning processes and pave the way for efficient adaptation in commercial devices with limited memory bandwidth.

Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on Stanford Cars dataset.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF -- both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation -- and open questions for the field.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, engineering design, continual learning, regression tasks, catastrophic forgetting 

Summary: 
This paper introduces the concept of continual learning (CL) to engineering design, addressing the challenge of models forgetting previously learned information when new data is introduced. By benchmarking various CL methods on regression tasks using engineering datasets, the study evaluates their ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting and improve generalization. Results indicate that applying CL methods, particularly the Replay strategy, can significantly enhance performance compared to naive baselines. The Replay strategy, in particular, achieved comparable results to retraining models from scratch while reducing training time by nearly half. This research demonstrates the potential of CL methods in enhancing real-world engineering workflows by allowing models to learn from sequential data and adapt to new constraints and designs. The code and datasets used in the study will be made available for further exploration and experimentation.

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

Summary: <br />
The proposed method, Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" to reduce peak memory usage during inference for long-context language models. Experiments show MOM can extend the maximum context length and maintain accuracy on various models. It reduces memory consumption significantly, changing research priorities from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage efficiency. MOM achieves over 50% peak memory reduction on average and increases context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU. Compared to traditional methods, MOM offers a 35% greater context length extension and competitive throughput performance due to efficient processing. This breakthrough eliminates prefill memory consumption as a primary bottleneck during inference, highlighting the importance of improving residual KV cache efficiency in future research. <div>

Abstract: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

<div> generalization, diffusion models, denoising score matching, score function, training distribution

Summary:<br />
- Diffusion models' generalization beyond their training set is not well understood.
- The denoising score matching (DSM) objective used for training is the score function of the training distribution.
- The noisy target used in training impacts the generalization of diffusion models.
- A mathematical theory explains the 'generalization through variance' phenomenon.
- The distributions learned by diffusion models fill in gaps in the training distribution due to the covariance structure of the noisy target.
- Diffusion models sample effectively from distributions that resemble their training distributions.
- The inductive bias of diffusion models is influenced by the covariance structure of the noisy target.
- The inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases. 

<br /><br />Summary: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training data is a mystery, despite being trained on the denoising score matching (DSM) objective. The noisy target in training impacts generalization, leading to a 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. A new mathematical theory explains how diffusion models fill in gaps in the training distribution, influenced by the covariance structure of the noisy target. The learned distributions resemble the training distribution, with an inductive bias from the noisy target and feature-related biases. <div>
arXiv:2504.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases.

Summary:
Safety is a crucial aspect in reinforcement learning (RL), but defining safety constraints can be challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for safe RL where the true safety definition is unknown. By utilizing a safety model that performs credit assignment based on labeled data, the impact of each decision step on overall safety can be estimated. The architecture of the safety model allows for separate safety scores at each timestep, enabling effective learning. The safe RL problem is reformulated using this model, leading to the development of an algorithm to optimize a policy that is both safe and rewarding. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this approach in various continuous control tasks. Overall, this research contributes to addressing safety concerns in RL scenarios where safety definitions are unclear or difficult to specify. 

<br /><br />Summary: Safety in reinforcement learning can be challenging to define, especially in scenarios where safety constraints are unknown. In this study, a safety model is introduced to estimate the impact of decision steps on overall safety based on labeled data. By reformulating the safe RL problem and developing an algorithm to optimize safe yet rewarding policies, this approach proves effective in satisfying unknown safety definitions. The architecture of the safety model allows for separate safety scores at each timestep, enhancing learning capabilities. Empirical results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of this method in various continuous control tasks, highlighting its potential for enhancing safety in RL environments. <div>

Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.

Summary: 
- Flood forecasting is crucial for early warning systems, with machine learning (ML) models proving to be effective when trained on large, diverse datasets.
- Global training of ML models can lead to a loss of ownership for national forecasters, hindering their ability to adapt models for local improvements.
- Local data, accessible only to local agencies, is valuable for enhancing model performance, as suggested by traditional hydrology research.
- The methodology of pre-training a model on a global dataset and fine-tuning it on local basin data can lead to performance increases, particularly in underperforming watersheds during global training.
- The study provides a roadmap for national forecasters to take control of global models using their own data, facilitating the operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore, traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.

Summary: 
Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) is proposed as an efficient alternative to Hebbian learning in the context of associative memories in neural networks. Unlike iterative methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), KRR learns dual variables non-iteratively through a closed-form solution, significantly reducing training time. Experimental results show that KRR achieves a high storage capacity, with a ratio of 1.5, and robustness against noise, recalling patterns even when corrupted by up to 80%. This performance is comparable to KLR, demonstrating the effectiveness of KRR in building high-performance associative memories efficiently. The study highlights the speed advantages of KRR in comparison to traditional iteratively learning methods, positioning it as a promising approach for efficiently implementing associative memory capabilities in neural networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO) is introduced as a hybrid algorithm combining neuroevolution with policy gradient methods to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning. EPO integrates the global exploration strengths of evolutionary computation with the local optimization capabilities of policy gradient methods, offering a solution to the dilemma in RL. Experimental evaluations on Atari Pong and Breakout benchmarks demonstrate that EPO enhances policy quality and sample efficiency compared to standard policy gradient and evolutionary computation methods.

arXiv:2504.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency. Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained, gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.

Summary: 
MagMatch introduces a novel framework for Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) that isolates out-of-distribution (OOD) samples using a prototype-based contrastive learning approach. Unlike existing methods, MagMatch does not assign prototypes to OOD samples, instead selectively aligning in-distribution (ID) samples with class prototypes through an ID-Selective Magnetic (ISM) module. This allows OOD samples to remain unaligned in the feature space. The framework also uses Selective Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which adjusts alignment dynamically based on sample confidence. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, MagMatch demonstrates superior performance in closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in generalizing to unseen OOD data. This approach offers a promising solution to the challenge of learning from mixed unlabeled data with both ID and OOD classes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in generalizing to unseen OOD data.

Summary: <br />
Federated learning allows collaborative training of deep learning models while preserving client data privacy. The traditional weighted averaging aggregation method based on client data volume declaration is susceptible to model bias due to dishonest clients. To tackle this issue, a new secure Federated Data Quantity-aware weighted averaging method (FedDua) is proposed. This approach enables servers to predict client data quantities accurately using local model gradients, enhancing global model performance by an average of 3.17% compared to existing methods in the presence of inaccurate data declarations. FedDua can be seamlessly integrated into various federated learning algorithms involving server-side aggregation, ensuring more reliable and efficient model training. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDua in enhancing model performance while addressing the challenges posed by inaccurate client data volume reporting. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client, which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17% compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate client data volume declarations.

Summary: 
Chemical kinetic model inference for combustion problems is complex due to large ODE systems and varied time scales. Traditional machine learning techniques struggle with the nonlinearity and numerical stiffness of these models. A novel approach, ChemKANs, combines the KAN-ODE framework with physical laws and an elemental conservation loss term, providing streamlined training and high accuracy predictions. ChemKANs show no overfitting and can accurately model hydrogen combustion with minimal parameters, offering a 2x acceleration over detailed chemistry in simulations. This demonstrates the scalability and potential of ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics, highlighting their applicability to larger and more challenging problems. <div>

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations (KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN (only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry, providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics, and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Discrimination-aware classification techniques aim to ensure fair predictions by considering protected attributes like gender and ethnicity. Traditional decision tree algorithms focus solely on information gain in the target attribute, potentially leading to biased models. In contrast, GroupCART, a tree-based ensemble optimizer, balances predictive accuracy with fairness by simultaneously optimizing for decreased entropy in the target attribute and increased entropy in protected attributes. Without requiring data transformation, GroupCART produces fairer models with minimal performance trade-offs. Additionally, the method allows for customizable weighting, enabling users to adjust the balance between predictive accuracy and fairness according to their needs. Overall, GroupCART demonstrates that algorithmic bias in decision tree models can be alleviated through multi-task, fairness-aware learning. <div>

Abstract: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering a smooth and flexible trade-off between predictive performance and fairness based on user requirements. These results demonstrate that algorithmic bias in decision tree models can be mitigated through multi-task, fairness-aware learning.

Summary: 
The study introduces modifications to the plain Transformer model to make it suitable for graph learning without complex architectural changes. The proposed modifications include using simplified $L_2$ attention to measure token closeness, adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitudes, and a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder. These modifications improve performance across various graph datasets. The research highlights significant gains in expressiveness in the graph isomorphism task. The study demonstrates that these simple modifications to the Transformer architecture can make it applicable to graph learning tasks and achieve notable performance improvements in graph-related applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1) simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder. Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in the graph isomorphism.

<div> Keywords: LLM ensembles, judgment distribution, maximum a posteriori framework, adaptive stopping, BetaConform

Summary: 
The paper introduces a maximum a posteriori framework for accurately estimating the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. It proposes a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution, enhancing over the traditional Binomial distribution. An adaptive stopping approach based on conformal prediction allows for efficient iterative sampling while maintaining accuracy. A prior transfer mechanism leverages distributions from open-source datasets to improve estimation on target datasets with limited annotations. The BetaConform framework integrates these components, providing a theoretically guaranteed estimation of LLM ensemble judgment with minimal labeled samples. Empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of BetaConform, enabling precise performance assessment of LLM judges with minimal data requirements. With as few as 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset, BetaConform can estimate performance with an error margin as small as 3.37%.

Abstract: LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution, revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset, for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error margin as small as 3.37%.

<div> Statistical tests, conditional independence, causal discovery, graphical properties, empirical distribution <br />
Summary:  
This study examines constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely on statistical tests for conditional independence to uncover causal networks. The algorithms assume a correspondence between graphical properties of causal structures and conditional independence properties of observed variables. Due to the finite nature of data, the empirical distribution may be close to, but not identical to, the true distribution. The research investigates the "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties by analyzing the manifolds that constrain the space of possible joint distributions. A measure of this meta-dependence is computed using information projections. Empirical validation is conducted using synthetic and real-world data, highlighting instances where multiple violations of conditional independencies can occur simultaneously. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between conditional independencies in causal networks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions, the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time. We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The "meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world data.

<div> Stochastic Gradient Descent, Convergence Analysis, Machine Learning, Non-convex Optimization, Step-size <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new analytical framework for analyzing the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in machine learning research. It allows for convergence analysis under more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions, compared to previous studies. The analysis proves almost sure convergence of SGD iterates in the non-convex setting for step-sizes that satisfy specific conditions. The results eliminate the need for global Lipschitz continuity assumption on the loss function and relax boundedness requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Additionally, $L_2$ convergence is established based on the almost sure convergence results. These relaxed assumptions make the theoretical results more general and applicable in practical scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $ \{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t = +\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p < +\infty$ for some $p > 2$. Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence. These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning techniques including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN inference are also discussed.

Summary:<br />
Machine-learned potentials (MLPs), particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have transformed materials discovery by accurately predicting molecular and material properties. While GNNs excel in capturing complex atomic interactions, they struggle with out-of-domain data, leading to unreliable predictions. To address this issue, the study explores Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a more computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, the research assesses its ability to provide dependable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets. The results show that DPOSE effectively differentiates between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, displaying higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This research underscores the potential of lightweight UQ methods in enhancing the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and sets the groundwork for future integration with active learning strategies.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.

Summary:
Hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models were compared with classical deep learning (C-DL) models for robustness against adversarial attacks in autonomous vehicle perception modules. Transfer learning models, alexnet and vgg-16, were used as feature extractors before being fed into the quantum system. Over 1000 quantum circuits were tested for three untargeted adversarial approaches: projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack (FGSA), and gradient attack (GA). Results showed that HCQ-DL models maintained high accuracy levels above 95% in no-attack scenarios and above 91% for GA and FGSA attacks, outperforming C-DL models. During the PGD attack, the alexnet-based HCQ-DL model achieved 85% accuracy compared to C-DL models with accuracies below 21%. This study demonstrates that HCQ-DL models offer improved accuracy for traffic sign classification in adversarial settings, making them a valuable tool for AV perception modules. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack (FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new feature selection method, FSCPU, designed specifically for positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenarios where only a few positive labels are available. FSCPU takes into account the clustering of positive labels in data to improve feature selection accuracy. By formulating feature selection as a binary optimization task and incorporating the cluster assumption, FSCPU shows effectiveness in various data conditions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate FSCPU's superiority compared to conventional methods. Additionally, performance comparisons on open datasets reveal FSCPU's competitive edge in downstream classification tasks, even when the cluster assumption is not strictly met. Overall, FSCPU offers a promising solution for efficient feature selection in PU learning scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

Summary:
VLMGuard-R1 introduces a novel approach to enhancing safety in Vision-Language Models by using multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. The framework refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to strengthen safety across various VLM architectures without changing their core parameters. A three-stage reasoning pipeline is developed to create a dataset that trains the rewriter to identify subtle threats and provide tailored responses instead of generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines, achieving a significant 43.59% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark. This proactive framework aims to align VLMs with safety standards by preempting intricate vulnerabilities through reasoning-driven prompt refinement.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20 participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures. This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk, providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust improvement.

Constrained Learning, a new paradigm for physics-informed neural networks, allows for the approximation of first-order derivatives using non-time course or partially observed data. MPOCtrL, an optimization approach tailored for Constrained Learning, balances fitting physical models and observed data. The framework effectively detects nonlinear dependencies between observed data and the underlying physical properties of a system. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that MPOCtrL outperforms existing data-driven flux estimators, particularly in metabolic flux analysis. MPOCtrL's code is available on GitHub for further use and development. <div>
arXiv:2504.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

Summary:
- The study examines continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks using gradient descent for a fixed number of iterations per task.
- When tasks are jointly linearly separable and presented in a cyclic/random order, the trained linear classifier converges towards the joint max-margin solution.
- Gradient descent training on a single task is biased towards individual max-margin solutions, but joint max-margin solution direction can differ significantly.
- Analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting when tasks are given cyclically reveals the relationship between task alignment, catastrophic forgetting, and knowledge transfer.
- Forgetting decreases as the cycle repeats, ultimately vanishing to zero.
- In cases where tasks are not jointly separable, the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions. Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1) alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

This paper introduces a novel approach using Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) in graph self-supervised learning. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of vector quantization in enhancing a graph autoencoder's ability to capture graph topology. It addresses challenges such as codebook underutilization and codebook space sparsity by proposing an annealing-based encoding strategy and a hierarchical two-layer codebook. The model outperforms 16 baseline methods in self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks on various datasets. The annealing-based encoding strategy promotes broad code utilization early in training and focuses on effective codes later. The hierarchical two-layer codebook captures relationships between embeddings, encouraging the model to learn closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology. <div>
arXiv:2504.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently. However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders, demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple datasets.

The paper addresses Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) using deep learning models. It re-evaluates complex designs in favor of simpler approaches like linear models and MLPs. The authors highlight techniques such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, commonly used in LTSF models, aiming to simplify and enhance deep learning utilization. Introducing TimeCapsule, a model based on high-dimensional information compression, they propose a 3D tensor representation for time series data, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions. Employing mode production for multi-mode dependency capture and dimensionality reduction, they suggest an internal forecast within the compressed domain.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper discusses the challenges of high-dimensional multi-label learning in artificial intelligence and introduces a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection) to address them. The curse of dimensionality is a major bottleneck in high-dimensional multi-label learning, but GPMFS aims to overcome it through a combination of global feature identification and personalized feature selection. By identifying global features shared across all labels and supplementing each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features, GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining interpretability and robustness. The method demonstrates the importance of considering label-specific information in feature selection, showing promising results on real-world datasets. GPMFS provides insights into label-specific strength and highlights the potential applicability of personalized optimization approaches in multi-label learning. <div>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However, existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature selection approaches.

<br />Summary: <br /> 
Decentralized Nonconvex Composite Federated Learning (DNCFL) is a promising area of research that addresses the challenges of nonconvex optimization problems in federated learning. The novel algorithm DEPOSITUM proposed in this paper leverages proximal stochastic gradient tracking to approximate global gradients and reduce variance in gradient estimation. By introducing momentums in the gradient descent step and supporting local updates, DEPOSITUM effectively manages data heterogeneity and minimizes communication costs. Theoretical analysis proves its efficiency by achieving an expected stationary point with a low iteration complexity. DEPOSITUM exhibits sublinear convergence rates for key performance metrics, enabling network-independent linear speedup without mega-batch sampling. Empirical evaluations on neural network training demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and superiority over existing federated optimization methods. <div>
arXiv:2504.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning, attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients. Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables, significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient, consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Summary:
Sign-In is a new approach proposed to address the performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch (PaI) and dense-to-sparse training in deep learning. The method focuses on finding correct parameter signs, which are crucial for PaI but often elusive. Sign-In utilizes dynamic reparameterization to induce sign flips, which complement the effects of dense-to-sparse training. Experimental results and theoretical analysis suggest that Sign-In can lead to performance improvements for PaI. However, the main challenge still remains in closing the performance gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training. This highlights the need for further research in optimizing parameter initialization techniques for efficient deep learning models.

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch (PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end, determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish, rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits. Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering. The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT) and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index. We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12 days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period. All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss of 2.2508 %.

arXiv:2504.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking. However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT. To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's optimization efficiency.

The paper introduces a new approach, iHHO-SMOTe, to address imbalanced datasets in machine learning. iHHO-SMOTe first cleanses data from noise points before oversampling the minority class using a hybrid approach. The process involves feature selection with random forest and outlier detection with DBSCAN. Experiments show the model's exceptional performance with an AUC score exceeding 0.99 and a high G-means score of 0.99, demonstrating its robustness. The F1-score consistently exceeds 0.967, indicating its effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets. The Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe model proves to be a promising solution for noise reduction and outlier handling, leading to improved classification models. <div>

Abstract: Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of 0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.

Summary:
The research introduces new vulnerabilities in federated learning (FL) due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients. A collaborative backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois is developed, where a pre-trained model with a Trojan is distributed to compromised clients to manipulate FL model training. This attack involves only a limited number of compromised clients and evades detection by existing defenses. CollaPois amplifies the impact of the Trojan, especially in scenarios with diverse data distributions among clients. The attack remains effective even with a small number of compromised clients and poses a higher risk to clients with locally aligned data. Experimental results show the superiority of CollaPois over existing backdoor attacks in FL settings, highlighting the need for robust defenses to mitigate such vulnerabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.
  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients, causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples, allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL algorithms.
  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses, especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions. Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor infections.

Summary: <br /><br />Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) pretrained on AudioSet are not effective for capturing the nuanced acoustic characteristics of specialized domains like bioacoustic monitoring. Bird sound classification, crucial for environmental health assessment, presents unique challenges that general-purpose models struggle to address.

Bird-MAE achieves superior results in all BirdSet downstream tasks, significantly enhancing multi-label classification performance compared to the Audio-MAE baseline. The study also introduces prototypical probing, a resource-efficient approach for leveraging frozen representations of MAEs. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37% in mean average precision (MAP), closing the gap with fine-tuning to approximately 3% on average on BirdSet. <div>

Summary:
Implicit bias and explicit regularization are essential in understanding how overparameterized models generalize well. This study integrates explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework to analyze its impact on the geometry of training dynamics. Three key effects are studied: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. The analysis covers various problems like sparse coding, matrix sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA. The lasting effect of regularization is explored, leading to the proposal of switching off weight decay during training to potentially improve generalization. Experimental results support the idea that dynamic weight decay schedules can enhance model performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we demonstrate in experiments.

The study revealed a natural separation of timescales based on input data covariance, resulting in staged learning. The analysis also provided an exact description of ICL development, including fixed points representing learned algorithms and conservation laws governing dynamics. Surprisingly, nonlinear learning behavior was observed in the linear model. The findings suggest that this behavior may extend to nonlinear models as well. Additionally, theory-inspired macroscopic measures were introduced to explain the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and delayed generalization in modular arithmetic models. This work provides a precise dynamical model for understanding ICL and tools for analyzing complex transformer training. <div>

Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Summary:
This article introduces a new unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the sliced-Wasserstein distance for training data selection in machine learning applications. It is particularly useful for critical sectors like power systems, offering conservative data selection and an optimal transport interpretation. The method includes two efficient approximations for scalability: processing reduced-cardinality representations of datasets concurrently and using a computationally light Euclidian distance approximation. The article also presents a first dataset on localized critical peak rebate demand response in a northern climate and showcases the filtering patterns of the method on synthetic datasets. Numerical benchmarking for training data selection and a forecasting benchmark for the open-source dataset are also demonstrated. <div>

Abstract: We propose a new unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the sliced-Wasserstein distance for training data selection in machine learning approaches. Our filtering technique is interesting for decision-making pipelines deploying machine learning models in critical sectors, e.g., power systems, as it offers a conservative data selection and an optimal transport interpretation. To ensure the scalability of our method, we provide two efficient approximations. The first approximation processes reduced-cardinality representations of the datasets concurrently. The second makes use of a computationally light Euclidian distance approximation. Additionally, we open the first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in a northern climate. We present the filtering patterns of our method on synthetic datasets and numerically benchmark our method for training data selection. Finally, we employ our method as part of a first forecasting benchmark for our open-source dataset.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to automate the labeling of ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) items. While the ARAT is commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and MiniROCKET as a time series classification technique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants performing various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and reliable approach for classifying ARAT domains, although challenges remain in distinguishing between individual resembling items. Future work may involve improving classification through more advanced machine-learning models and data enhancements.

<title>RL-PINNs: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Adaptive Sampling for Efficient Training of PINNs</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their performance heavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear, high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead, making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

<title>Why Ask One When You Can Ask $k$? Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer to a Set of Experts</title>

arXiv:2504.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query, based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

<title>Inference-friendly Graph Compression for Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

<title>An All-Atom Generative Model for Designing Protein Complexes</title>

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions. Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

<title>An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research</title>

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH), suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However, current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: https://kumarmanas.github.io/SHIFT/.

Abstract: While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural design in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied primitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across various applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed as a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy of its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains: higher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation modulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability to model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it particularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing scenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks, such as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation masking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This systematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard product's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation for future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product as a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between computational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a crucial component in the deep learning toolkit.

To address these issues, we propose Quorum, the first quantum anomaly detection framework designed for unsupervised learning that operates without requiring any training.

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in 2013 to just 0.2% in 2023. As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the development of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly important to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting, and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value, F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest sensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023 herd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the number of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.

Abstract: Cold temperatures can cause significant frost damage to fruit crops depending on their resilience, or cold hardiness, which changes throughout the dormancy season. This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models, which help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures. Unfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for some fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise. Rather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of budbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we introduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels (TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more accurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is available for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks (cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and auxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is assumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict primary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks. Surprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our knowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we propose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that can leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our results on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape cultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve cold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models. MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g., attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g., sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e., standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that there has been real progress in the field.

Abstract: Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models. Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias. Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either (1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and (iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta, Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent models.

Abstract: We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models. Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines) connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain 93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\"ive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary, can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011 first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data remains an underutilized resource.

Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

<title>Geographical Context Matters: Bridging Fine and Coarse Spatial Information to Enhance Continental Land Cover Mapping</title>

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region) spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance, with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and coarse-grained spatial information.

Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50 degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models in industrial steel production applications.

Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations. The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions concerning AA.

Abstract: Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2 in mean error.

<title>Position: The Most Expensive Part of an LLM should be its Training Data</title>

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study 64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers. In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions that could enable fairer practices in the future.

Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially, we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks, offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap in robotics and control.

Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased, feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are available.

Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random, fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture. Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while deepening our understanding of neural computation.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules). However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD, increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by $\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions. Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem and MNIST.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and (2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT) baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures, computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability, making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex, contaminated datasets.

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens. We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books, piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus, likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama 3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However, privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374 mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth, width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression. Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.

<title>Identifying and Mitigating the Influence of the Prior Distribution in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases, LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly, and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons related to the prior probability of token sequences.

Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates. Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs), generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

arXiv:2504.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of forgetting, critical for generalization.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human data.

<title>Post-pre-training for Modality Alignment in Vision-Language Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features. Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the zero-shot performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator, similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low power wireless devices.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their utility as proxies for real-world settings.

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models. While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored, limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS, based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane, sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale, perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests. Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First, we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates; (ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias. Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding of why random forests work well in many applications.

Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs, ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs. By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So, are retrials all you need?

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps, it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic representation of the relations between categories through word vector distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.

Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level. We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data, incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings, we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with molecular resolution.

<title>ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles (perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then, ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions. The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor is open-sourced at https://github.com/Jozenn/ArtistAuditor.

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance'' property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of large language models (LLMs) to financial tasks. We fine-tuned foundation models using the Open FinLLM Leaderboard as a benchmark. Building on Qwen2.5 and Deepseek-R1, we employed techniques including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their financial capabilities. The fine-tuned models demonstrated substantial performance gains across a wide range of financial tasks. Moreover, we measured the data scaling law in the financial domain. Our work demonstrates the potential of large language models (LLMs) in financial applications.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis. First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore, an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model. Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework, comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution -- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains -- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger, as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a broad variety of controlled generation problems.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes, code & models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often exploit *spurious* features that are present in the majority of examples within a class during training. This leads to *poor worst-group test accuracy*, i.e., poor accuracy for minority groups that lack these spurious features. Despite the growing body of recent efforts to address spurious correlations (SC), several challenging settings remain unexplored.In this work, we propose studying methods to mitigate SC in settings with: 1) spurious features that are learned more slowly, 2) a larger number of classes, and 3) a larger number of groups. We introduce two new datasets, Animals and SUN, to facilitate this study and conduct a systematic benchmarking of 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across a total of 5 vision datasets, training over 5,000 models. Through this, we highlight how existing group inference methods struggle in the presence of spurious features that are learned later in training. Additionally, we demonstrate how all existing methods struggle in settings with more groups and/or classes. Finally, we show the importance of careful model selection (hyperparameter tuning) in extracting optimal performance, especially in the more challenging settings we introduced, and propose more cost-efficient strategies for model selection. Overall, through extensive and systematic experiments, this work uncovers a suite of new challenges and opportunities for improving worst-group generalization in the presence of spurious features.

Abstract: We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.

Abstract: Non-conjugate Gaussian processes (NCGPs) define a flexible probabilistic framework to model categorical, ordinal and continuous data, and are widely used in practice. However, exact inference in NCGPs is prohibitively expensive for large datasets, thus requiring approximations in practice. The approximation error adversely impacts the reliability of the model and is not accounted for in the uncertainty of the prediction. We introduce a family of iterative methods that explicitly model this error. They are uniquely suited to parallel modern computing hardware, efficiently recycle computations, and compress information to reduce both the time and memory requirements for NCGPs. As we demonstrate on large-scale classification problems, our method significantly accelerates posterior inference compared to competitive baselines by trading off reduced computation for increased uncertainty.

Abstract: Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose PraX, a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate PraX on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.

Abstract: In data science, hypergraphs are natural models for data exhibiting multi-way relations, whereas graphs only capture pairwise. Nonetheless, many proposed hypergraph neural networks effectively reduce hypergraphs to undirected graphs via symmetrized matrix representations, potentially losing important information. We propose an alternative approach to hypergraph neural networks in which the hypergraph is represented as a non-reversible Markov chain. We use this Markov chain to construct a complex Hermitian Laplacian matrix - the magnetic Laplacian - which serves as the input to our proposed hypergraph neural network. We study HyperMagNet for the task of node classification, and demonstrate its effectiveness over graph-reduction based hypergraph neural networks.

Abstract: Diffusion models represent a powerful family of generative models widely used for image and video generation. However, the time-consuming deployment, long inference time, and requirements on large memory hinder their applications on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a method based on the improved Straight-Through Estimator to improve the deployment efficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we add sparse masks to the Convolution and Linear layers in a pre-trained diffusion model, then transfer learn the sparse model during the fine-tuning stage and turn on the sparse masks during inference. Experimental results on a Transformer and UNet-based diffusion models demonstrate that our method reduces MACs by 50% while maintaining FID. Sparse models are accelerated by approximately 1.2x on the GPU. Under other MACs conditions, the FID is also lower than 1 compared to other methods.

Abstract: To perform effective causal inference in high-dimensional datasets, initiating the process with causal discovery is imperative, wherein a causal graph is generated based on observational data. However, obtaining a complete and accurate causal graph poses a formidable challenge, recognized as an NP- hard problem. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era, indicating their emergent capabilities and widespread applicability in facilitating causal reasoning across diverse domains, such as medicine, finance, and science. The expansive knowledge base of LLMs holds the potential to elevate the field of causal reasoning by offering interpretability, making inferences, generalizability, and uncovering novel causal structures. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, named Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework (ALCM), to synergize data-driven causal discovery algorithms and LLMs, automating the generation of a more resilient, accurate, and explicable causal graph. The ALCM consists of three integral components: causal structure learning, causal wrapper, and LLM-driven causal refiner. These components autonomously collaborate within a dynamic environment to address causal discovery questions and deliver plausible causal graphs. We evaluate the ALCM framework by implementing two demonstrations on seven well-known datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ALCM outperforms existing LLM methods and conventional data-driven causal reasoning mechanisms. This study not only shows the effectiveness of the ALCM but also underscores new research directions in leveraging the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Sleep is vital for people's physical and mental health, and sound sleep can help them focus on daily activities. Therefore, a sleep study that includes sleep patterns and sleep disorders is crucial to enhancing our knowledge about individuals' health status. This study aims to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the recent literature to analyze the different approaches and their outcomes in sleep studies, which includes works on "sleep stages classification" and "sleep disorder detection" using AI. In this review, 183 articles were initially selected from different journals, among which 80 records were enlisted for explicit review, ranging from 2016 to 2023. Brain waves were the most commonly employed body parameters for sleep staging and disorder studies (almost 29% of the research used brain activity signals exclusively, and 77% combined with the other signals). The convolutional neural network (CNN), the most widely used of the 34 distinct artificial intelligence models, comprised 27%. The other models included the long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and recurrent neural network (RNN), which consisted of 11%, 6%, 6%, and 5% sequentially. For performance metrics, accuracy was widely used for a maximum of 83.75% of the cases, the F1 score of 45%, Kappa of 36.25%, Sensitivity of 31.25%, and Specificity of 30% of cases, along with the other metrics. This article would help physicians and researchers get the gist of AI's contribution to sleep studies and the feasibility of their intended work.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model. This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates, we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.

Abstract: Multi-modal methods establish comprehensive superiority over uni-modal methods. However, the imbalanced contributions of different modalities to task-dependent predictions constantly degrade the discriminative performance of canonical multi-modal methods. Based on the contribution to task-dependent predictions, modalities can be identified as predominant and auxiliary modalities. Benchmark methods raise a tractable solution: augmenting the auxiliary modality with a minor contribution during training. However, our empirical explorations challenge the fundamental idea behind such behavior, and we further conclude that benchmark approaches suffer from certain defects: insufficient theoretical interpretability and limited exploration capability of discriminative knowledge. To this end, we revisit multi-modal representation learning from a causal perspective and build the Structural Causal Model. Following the empirical explorations, we determine to capture the true causality between the discriminative knowledge of predominant modality and predictive label while considering the auxiliary modality. Thus, we introduce the $\beta$-generalization front-door criterion. Furthermore, we propose a novel network for sufficiently exploring multi-modal discriminative knowledge. Rigorous theoretical analyses and various empirical evaluations are provided to support the effectiveness of the innate mechanism behind our proposed method.

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced the field of continual learning (CL), enabling positive knowledge transfer and resilience to catastrophic forgetting. To sustain these advantages for sequentially arriving tasks, a promising direction involves keeping the pre-trained backbone frozen while employing parameter-efficient tuning (PET) techniques to instruct representation learning. Despite the popularity of Prompt-based PET for CL, its empirical design often leads to sub-optimal performance in our evaluation of different PTMs and target tasks. To this end, we propose a unified framework for CL with PTMs and PET that provides both theoretical and empirical advancements. We first perform an in-depth theoretical analysis of the CL objective in a pre-training context, decomposing it into hierarchical components namely within-task prediction, task-identity inference and task-adaptive prediction. We then present Hierarchical Decomposition PET (HiDe-PET), an innovative approach that explicitly optimizes the decomposed objective through incorporating task-specific and task-shared knowledge via mainstream PET techniques along with efficient recovery of pre-trained representations. Leveraging this framework, we delve into the distinct impacts of implementation strategy, PET technique and PET architecture, as well as adaptive knowledge accumulation amidst pronounced distribution changes. Finally, across various CL scenarios, our approach demonstrates remarkably superior performance over a broad spectrum of recent strong baselines.

Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.

Abstract: On-device inference holds great potential for increased energy efficiency, responsiveness, and privacy in edge ML systems. However, due to less capable ML models that can be embedded in resource-limited devices, use cases are limited to simple inference tasks such as visual keyword spotting, gesture recognition, and predictive analytics. In this context, the Hierarchical Inference (HI) system has emerged as a promising solution that augments the capabilities of the local ML by offloading selected samples to an edge server or cloud for remote ML inference. Existing works demonstrate through simulation that HI improves accuracy. However, they do not account for the latency and energy consumption on the device, nor do they consider three key heterogeneous dimensions that characterize ML systems: hardware, network connectivity, and models. In contrast, this paper systematically compares the performance of HI with on-device inference based on measurements of accuracy, latency, and energy for running embedded ML models on five devices with different capabilities and three image classification datasets. For a given accuracy requirement, the HI systems we designed achieved up to 73% lower latency and up to 77% lower device energy consumption than an on-device inference system. The key to building an efficient HI system is the availability of small-size, reasonably accurate on-device models whose outputs can be effectively differentiated for samples that require remote inference. Despite the performance gains, HI requires on-device inference for all samples, which adds a fixed overhead to its latency and energy consumption. Therefore, we design a hybrid system, Early Exit with HI (EE-HI), and demonstrate that compared to HI, EE-HI reduces the latency by up to 59.7% and lowers the device's energy consumption by up to 60.4%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks. Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/AI4Chem/ChemVLM-26B.

Abstract: The performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) is susceptible to discrepancies between training and testing sample distributions. Prior studies have attempted to mitigating the impact of distribution shift by reconstructing node features during the testing phase without modifying the model parameters. However, these approaches lack theoretical analysis of the proximity between predictions and ground truth at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel node feature reconstruction method grounded in Lyapunov stability theory. Specifically, we model the GNN as a control system during the testing phase, considering node features as control variables. A neural controller that adheres to the Lyapunov stability criterion is then employed to reconstruct these node features, ensuring that the predictions progressively approach the ground truth at test time. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Most work on causality in machine learning assumes that causal relationships are driven by a constant underlying process. However, the flexibility of agents' actions or tipping points in the environmental process can change the qualitative dynamics of the system. As a result, new causal relationships may emerge, while existing ones change or disappear, resulting in an altered causal graph. To analyze these qualitative changes on the causal graph, we propose the concept of meta-causal states, which groups classical causal models into clusters based on equivalent qualitative behavior and consolidates specific mechanism parameterizations. We demonstrate how meta-causal states can be inferred from observed agent behavior, and discuss potential methods for disentangling these states from unlabeled data. Finally, we direct our analysis towards the application of a dynamical system, showing that meta-causal states can also emerge from inherent system dynamics, and thus constitute more than a context-dependent framework in which mechanisms emerge only as a result of external factors.

Abstract: Transformers often struggle with length generalization, meaning they fail to generalize to sequences longer than those encountered during training. While arithmetic tasks are commonly used to study length generalization, certain tasks are considered notoriously difficult, e.g., multi-operand addition (requiring generalization over both the number of operands and their lengths) and multiplication (requiring generalization over both operand lengths). In this work, we achieve approximately 2-3x length generalization on both tasks, which is the first such achievement in arithmetic Transformers. We design task-specific scratchpads enabling the model to focus on a fixed number of tokens per each next-token prediction step, and apply multi-level versions of \Position Coupling (Cho et al., 2024; McLeish et al., 2024) to let Transformers know the right position to attend to. On the theory side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer using our method can solve multi-operand addition, up to operand length and operand count that are exponential in embedding dimension.

Abstract: Rigid body interactions are fundamental to numerous scientific disciplines, but remain challenging to simulate due to their abrupt nonlinear nature and sensitivity to complex, often unknown environmental factors. These challenges call for adaptable learning-based methods capable of capturing complex interactions beyond explicit physical models and simulations. While graph neural networks can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex scenes and long-term predictions. We introduce a novel framework for modeling rigid body dynamics and learning collision interactions, addressing key limitations of existing graph-based methods. Our approach extends the traditional representation of meshes by incorporating higher-order topology complexes, offering a physically consistent representation. Additionally, we propose a physics-informed message-passing neural architecture, embedding physical laws directly in the model. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy, even during long rollouts, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios. Importantly, this work addresses the challenge of multi-entity dynamic interactions, with applications spanning diverse scientific and engineering domains.

Abstract: Simulating and controlling physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial tasks across science and engineering. Recently, diffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for these tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model high-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with handling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions. In this work, we propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO), a novel PDE simulation and control framework that enhances the handling of these complexities. WDNO comprises two key innovations. Firstly, WDNO performs diffusion-based generative modeling in the wavelet domain for the entire trajectory to handle abrupt changes and long-term dependencies effectively. Secondly, to address the issue of poor generalization across different resolutions, which is one of the fundamental tasks in modeling physical systems, we introduce multi-resolution training. We validate WDNO on five physical systems, including 1D advection equation, three challenging physical systems with abrupt changes (1D Burgers' equation, 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equation and 2D incompressible fluid), and a real-world dataset ERA5, which demonstrates superior performance on both simulation and control tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in long-term and detail prediction accuracy. Remarkably, in the challenging context of the 2D high-dimensional and indirect control task aimed at reducing smoke leakage, WDNO reduces the leakage by 33.2% compared to the second-best baseline.

<title>AHSG: Adversarial Attack on High-level Semantics in Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Graph Neural Networks aim to perturb the performance of the learner by carefully modifying the graph topology and node attributes. Existing methods achieve attack stealthiness by constraining the modification budget and differences in graph properties. However, these methods typically disrupt task-relevant primary semantics directly, which results in low defensibility and detectability of the attack. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Attack on High-level Semantics for Graph Neural Networks (AHSG), which is a graph structure attack model that ensures the retention of primary semantics. By combining latent representations with shared primary semantics, our model retains detectable attributes and relational patterns of the original graph while leveraging more subtle changes to carry out the attack. Then we use the Projected Gradient Descent algorithm to map the latent representations with attack effects to the adversarial graph. Through experiments on robust graph deep learning models equipped with defense strategies, we demonstrate that AHSG outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in attack effectiveness. Additionally, using Contextual Stochastic Block Models to detect the attacked graph further validates that our method preserves the primary semantics of the graph.

Abstract: Consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have significantly advanced semi-supervised learning (SSL). Prior works have effectively employed Mixup for consistency regularization in SSL. However, our findings indicate that applying Mixup for consistency regularization may degrade SSL performance by compromising the purity of artificial labels. Moreover, most pseudo-labeling based methods utilize thresholding strategy to exclude low-confidence data, aiming to mitigate confirmation bias; however, this approach limits the utility of unlabeled samples. To address these challenges, we propose RegMixMatch, a novel framework that optimizes the use of Mixup with both high- and low-confidence samples in SSL. First, we introduce semi-supervised RegMixup, which effectively addresses reduced artificial labels purity by using both mixed samples and clean samples for training. Second, we develop a class-aware Mixup technique that integrates information from the top-2 predicted classes into low-confidence samples and their artificial labels, reducing the confirmation bias associated with these samples and enhancing their effective utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that RegMixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SSL benchmarks.

<title>Predicting Change, Not States: An Alternate Framework for Neural PDE Surrogates</title>

Abstract: Neural surrogates for partial differential equations (PDEs) have become popular due to their potential to quickly simulate physics. With a few exceptions, neural surrogates generally treat the forward evolution of time-dependent PDEs as a black box by directly predicting the next state. While this is a natural and easy framework for applying neural surrogates, it can be an over-simplified and rigid framework for predicting physics. In this work, we evaluate an alternate framework in which neural solvers predict the temporal derivative and an ODE integrator forwards the solution in time, which has little overhead and is broadly applicable across model architectures and PDEs. We find that by simply changing the training target and introducing numerical integration during inference, neural surrogates can gain accuracy and stability in finely-discretized regimes. Predicting temporal derivatives also allows models to not be constrained to a specific temporal discretization, allowing for flexible time-stepping during inference or training on higher-resolution PDE data. Lastly, we investigate why this framework can be beneficial and in what situations does it work well.

Abstract: Prototype-based classification learning methods are known to be inherently interpretable. However, this paradigm suffers from major limitations compared to deep models, such as lower performance. This led to the development of the so-called deep Prototype-Based Networks (PBNs), also known as prototypical parts models. In this work, we analyze these models with respect to different properties, including interpretability. In particular, we focus on the Classification-by-Components (CBC) approach, which uses a probabilistic model to ensure interpretability and can be used as a shallow or deep architecture. We show that this model has several shortcomings, like creating contradicting explanations. Based on these findings, we propose an extension of CBC that solves these issues. Moreover, we prove that this extension has robustness guarantees and derive a loss that optimizes robustness. Additionally, our analysis shows that most (deep) PBNs are related to (deep) RBF classifiers, which implies that our robustness guarantees generalize to shallow RBF classifiers. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that our deep PBN yields state-of-the-art classification accuracy on different benchmarks while resolving the interpretability shortcomings of other approaches. Further, our shallow PBN variant outperforms other shallow PBNs while being inherently interpretable and exhibiting provable robustness guarantees.

Abstract: Feature-based explanations, using perturbations or gradients, are a prevalent tool to understand decisions of black box machine learning models. Yet, differences between these methods still remain mostly unknown, which limits their applicability for practitioners. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for local and global feature-based explanations using two well-established concepts: functional ANOVA (fANOVA) from statistics, and the notion of value and interaction from cooperative game theory. We introduce three fANOVA decompositions that determine the influence of feature distributions, and use game-theoretic measures, such as the Shapley value and interactions, to specify the influence of higher-order interactions. Our framework combines these two dimensions to uncover similarities and differences between a wide range of explanation techniques for features and groups of features. We then empirically showcase the usefulness of our framework on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: De novo generation of hit-like molecules is a challenging task in the drug discovery process. Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a hybrid neural network, HNN2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed HNN2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.

Abstract: The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generative tasks, but aligning them with specific objectives while maintaining their versatility remains challenging. Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free, test-time method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.

Abstract: Deploying complex machine learning models on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to limited computational power, memory, and model retrainability. To address these limitations, a hybrid system can be established by augmenting the local model with a server-side model, where samples are selectively deferred by a rejector and then sent to the server for processing. The hybrid system enables efficient use of computational resources while minimizing the overhead associated with server usage. The recently proposed Learning to Help (L2H) model trains a server model given a fixed local (client) model, differing from the Learning to Defer (L2D) framework, which trains the client for a fixed (expert) server. In both L2D and L2H, the training includes learning a rejector at the client to determine when to query the server. In this work, we extend the L2H model from binary to multi-class classification problems and demonstrate its applicability in a number of different scenarios of practical interest in which access to the server may be limited by cost, availability, or policy. We derive a stage-switching surrogate loss function that is differentiable, convex, and consistent with the Bayes rule corresponding to the 0-1 loss for the L2H model. Experiments show that our proposed methods offer an efficient and practical solution for multi-class classification in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers -- using both PINNs and PIKANs -- on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.

Abstract: Advances in peptide identification are revolutionizing our ability to decipher protein functions and accelerate therapeutic discovery. We present PDeepPP, a deep learning framework that integrates pretrained protein language models with parallel transformer-CNN architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in peptide characterization tasks. The model's hybrid architecture demonstrates unique capabilities in capturing both local sequence motifs and global structural features, as evidenced by 29% improved cluster separation in UMAP visualizations compared to conventional approaches. Evaluated across 33 biological recognition tasks - including post-translational modification site prediction and bioactive peptide identification - PDeepPP outperformed existing methods in 25 tasks with average AUC improvements of 4.2%. Notably, it achieved 0.9726 accuracy with PR AUC 0.9977 in antimicrobial peptide detection while reducing false negatives by 37.5% in antimalarial recognition scenarios. This framework enables accurate large-scale peptide analysis, achieving 218* acceleration over sequence-alignment-based methods while maintaining 99.5% specificity in critical glycosylation site detection.PDeepPP establishes a new paradigm for computational peptide analysis through its synergistic architecture design, enabling rapid yet precise functional annotation that bridges molecular pattern recognition with translational biomedical applications.We have made our implementation, including code, data, and pretrained models, publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/fondress/PDeepPP) and Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/fondress/PDeppPP).

However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.

Abstract: We introduce methods for obtaining pretrained Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) that can serve as basal foundation models for use in obtaining geometric features. These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We release codes and weights for using GNPs in the package geo_neural_op. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.

Abstract: One of the central challenges in modern machine learning is understanding how neural networks generalize knowledge learned from training data to unseen test data. While numerous empirical techniques have been proposed to improve generalization, a theoretical understanding of the mechanism of generalization remains elusive. Here we introduce the concept of Boltzmann entropy into neural networks by re-conceptualizing such networks as hypothetical molecular systems where weights and biases are atomic coordinates, and the loss function is the potential energy. By employing molecular simulation algorithms, we compute entropy landscapes as functions of both training loss and test accuracy (or test loss), on networks with up to 1 million parameters, across four distinct machine learning tasks: arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of high-entropy advantage, wherein high-entropy network states generally outperform those reached via conventional training techniques like stochastic gradient descent. This entropy advantage provides a thermodynamic explanation for neural network generalizability: the generalizable states occupy a larger part of the parameter space than its non-generalizable analog at low train loss. Furthermore, we find this advantage more pronounced in narrower neural networks, indicating a need for different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of networks.

<title>Impact of Data Duplication on Deep Neural Network-Based Image Classifiers: Robust vs. Standard Models</title>

Abstract: The accuracy and robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks are significantly influenced by factors such as training data quality, model architecture, the training process, and the deployment environment. In recent years, duplicated data in training sets, especially in language models, has attracted considerable attention. It has been shown that deduplication enhances both training performance and model accuracy in language models. While the importance of data quality in training image classifier Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is widely recognized, the impact of duplicated images in the training set on model generalization and performance has received little attention.
  In this paper, we address this gap and provide a comprehensive study on the effect of duplicates in image classification. Our analysis indicates that the presence of duplicated images in the training set not only negatively affects the efficiency of model training but also may result in lower accuracy of the image classifier. This negative impact of duplication on accuracy is particularly evident when duplicated data is non-uniform across classes or when duplication, whether uniform or non-uniform, occurs in the training set of an adversarially trained model. Even when duplicated samples are selected in a uniform way, increasing the amount of duplication does not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in industrial artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the industry by driving smarter manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and intelligent decision-making. However, existing approaches often focus primarily on algorithms and models while overlooking the importance of systematically integrating domain knowledge, data, and models to develop more comprehensive and effective AI solutions. Therefore, the effective development and deployment of industrial AI require a more comprehensive and systematic approach. To address this gap, this paper reviews previous research, rethinks the role of industrial AI, and proposes a unified industrial AI foundation framework comprising three core modules: the knowledge module, data module, and model module. These modules help to extend and enhance the industrial AI methodology platform, supporting various industrial applications. In addition, a case study on rotating machinery diagnosis is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and several future directions are highlighted for the development of the industrial AI foundation framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without extensive reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/GPG.

Abstract: Much of the federated learning (FL) literature focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing time. Recent advances in domain generalization (DG) aim to use data from source (training) domains to train a model that generalizes well to data from unseen target (testing) domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives and training processes; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the conventional star-topology architecture. Addressing the second gap, we develop $\textit{Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing}$ ($\texttt{StyleDDG}$), a fully decentralized DG algorithm designed to allow devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we fill the first gap by providing the first systematic approach to mathematically analyzing style-based DG training optimization. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\texttt{StyleDDG}$. Based on this, we obtain analytical conditions under which a sub-linear convergence rate of $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can be obtained. Through experiments on two popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\texttt{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal added communication overhead compared to decentralized gradient methods that do not employ style sharing.

Abstract: Column Generation (CG) is a popular method dedicated to enhancing computational efficiency in large scale Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. It reduces the number of decision variables in a problem by solving a pricing problem. For many CO problems, the pricing problem is an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). Large ESPPRC instances are difficult to solve to near-optimality. Consequently, we use a Graph neural Network (GNN) to reduces the size of the ESPPRC such that it becomes computationally tractable with standard solving techniques. Our GNN is trained by Unsupervised Learning and outputs a distribution for the arcs to be retained in the reduced PP. The reduced PP is solved by a local search that finds columns with large reduced costs and speeds up convergence. We apply our method on a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows and show significant improvements in convergence compared to simple reduction techniques from the literature. For a fixed computational budget, we improve the objective values by over 9\% for larger instances. We also analyze the performance of our CG algorithm and test the generalization of our method to different classes of instances than the training data.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.

Abstract: As model sizes grow, finding efficient and cost-effective hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods becomes increasingly crucial for deep learning pipelines. While multi-fidelity HPO (MF-HPO) trades off computational resources required for DL training with lower fidelity estimations, existing fidelity sources often fail under lower compute and memory constraints. We propose a novel fidelity source: the number of layers that are trained or frozen during training. For deep networks, this approach offers significant compute and memory savings while preserving rank correlations between hyperparameters at low fidelities compared to full model training. We demonstrate this in our empirical evaluation across ResNets and Transformers and additionally analyze the utility of frozen layers as a fidelity in using GPU resources as a fidelity in HPO, and for a combined MF-HPO with other fidelity sources. This contribution opens new applications for MF-HPO with hardware resources as a fidelity and creates opportunities for improved algorithms navigating joint fidelity spaces.

Abstract: Link prediction on graphs has applications spanning from recommender systems to drug discovery. Temporal link prediction (TLP) refers to predicting future links in a temporally evolving graph and adds additional complexity related to the dynamic nature of graphs. State-of-the-art TLP models incorporate memory modules alongside graph neural networks to learn both the temporal mechanisms of incoming nodes and the evolving graph topology. However, memory modules only store information about nodes seen at train time, and hence such models cannot be directly transferred to entirely new graphs at test time and deployment. In this work, we study a new transfer learning task for temporal link prediction, and develop transfer-effective methods for memory-laden models. Specifically, motivated by work showing the informativeness of structural signals for the TLP task, we augment a structural mapping module to the existing TLP model architectures, which learns a mapping from graph structural (topological) features to memory embeddings. Our work paves the way for a memory-free foundation model for TLP.

Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to their local quadratic convergence. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. We present the \emph{Second-Order Conditional Gradient Sliding} (SOCGS) algorithm, which uses a projection-free algorithm to solve the constrained quadratic subproblems inexactly. When the feasible region is a polytope the algorithm converges quadratically in primal gap after a finite number of linearly convergent iterations. Once in the quadratic regime the SOCGS algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(\log(\log 1/\varepsilon))$ first-order and Hessian oracle calls and $\mathcal{O}(\log (1/\varepsilon) \log(\log1/\varepsilon))$ linear minimization oracle calls to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. This algorithm is useful when the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information of the function, although possible, is costly.

Abstract: Combining deep learning with symbolic logic reasoning aims to capitalize on the success of both fields and is drawing increasing attention. Inspired by DeepLogic, an end-to-end model trained to perform inference on logic programs, we introduce IMA-GloVe-GA, an iterative neural inference network for multi-step reasoning expressed in natural language. In our model, reasoning is performed using an iterative memory neural network based on RNN with a gated attention mechanism. We evaluate IMA-GloVe-GA on three datasets: PARARULES, CONCEPTRULES V1 and CONCEPTRULES V2. Experimental results show DeepLogic with gated attention can achieve higher test accuracy than DeepLogic and other RNN baseline models. Our model achieves better out-of-distribution generalisation than RoBERTa-Large when the rules have been shuffled. Furthermore, to address the issue of unbalanced distribution of reasoning depths in the current multi-step reasoning datasets, we develop PARARULE-Plus, a large dataset with more examples that require deeper reasoning steps. Experimental results show that the addition of PARARULE-Plus can increase the model's performance on examples requiring deeper reasoning depths. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Strong-AI-Lab/Multi-Step-Deductive-Reasoning-Over-Natural-Language.

Abstract: Representation multi-task learning (MTL) has achieved tremendous success in practice. However, the theoretical understanding of these methods is still lacking. Most existing theoretical works focus on cases where all tasks share the same representation, and claim that MTL almost always improves performance. Nevertheless, as the number of tasks grows, assuming all tasks share the same representation is unrealistic. Furthermore, empirical findings often indicate that a shared representation does not necessarily improve single-task learning performance. In this paper, we aim to understand how to learn from tasks with \textit{similar but not exactly the same} linear representations, while dealing with outlier tasks. Assuming a known intrinsic dimension, we propose a penalized empirical risk minimization method and a spectral method that are \textit{adaptive} to the similarity structure and \textit{robust} to outlier tasks. Both algorithms outperform single-task learning when representations across tasks are sufficiently similar and the proportion of outlier tasks is small. Moreover, they always perform at least as well as single-task learning, even when the representations are dissimilar. We provide information-theoretic lower bounds to demonstrate that both methods are nearly \textit{minimax} optimal in a large regime, with the spectral method being optimal in the absence of outlier tasks. Additionally, we introduce a thresholding algorithm to adapt to an unknown intrinsic dimension. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Growth in system complexity increases the need for automated log analysis techniques, such as Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD). While deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used for LAD, traditional machine learning (ML) techniques can also perform well depending on the context and dataset. Semi-supervised techniques deserve the same attention as they offer practical advantages over fully supervised methods. Current evaluations mainly focus on detection accuracy, but this alone is insufficient to determine the suitability of a technique for a given LAD task. Other aspects to consider include training and prediction times as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, which in practice matters to engineers.
  This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating a wide range of supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques across four criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning in both detection accuracy and time performance. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques fare similarly in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time on most of the benchmark datasets considered in our study. Moreover, overall, sensitivity analysis to hyperparameter tuning with respect to detection accuracy shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often assume that input features are available at no cost. However, in domains like healthcare, where acquiring features could be expensive or harmful, it is necessary to balance a feature's acquisition cost against its predictive value. The task of training an AI agent to decide which features to acquire is called active feature acquisition (AFA). By deploying an AFA agent, we effectively alter the acquisition strategy and trigger a distribution shift. To safely deploy AFA agents under this distribution shift, we present the problem of active feature acquisition performance evaluation (AFAPE). We examine AFAPE under i) a no direct effect (NDE) assumption, stating that acquisitions do not affect the underlying feature values; and ii) a no unobserved confounding (NUC) assumption, stating that retrospective feature acquisition decisions were only based on observed features. We show that one can apply missing data methods under the NDE assumption and offline reinforcement learning under the NUC assumption. When NUC and NDE hold, we propose a novel semi-offline reinforcement learning framework. This framework requires a weaker positivity assumption and introduces three new estimators: A direct method (DM), an inverse probability weighting (IPW), and a double reinforcement learning (DRL) estimator.

Abstract: We address binary classification using neural ordinary differential equations from the perspective of simultaneous control of $N$ data points. We consider a single-neuron architecture with parameters fixed as piecewise constant functions of time. In this setting, the model complexity can be quantified by the number of control switches. Previous work has shown that classification can be achieved using a point-by-point strategy that requires $O(N)$ switches. We propose a new control method that classifies any arbitrary dataset by sequentially steering clusters of $d$ points, thereby reducing the complexity to $O(N/d)$ switches. The optimality of this result, particularly in high dimensions, is supported by some numerical experiments. Our complexity bound is sufficient but often conservative because same-class points tend to appear in larger clusters, simplifying classification. This motivates studying the probability distribution of the number of switches required. We introduce a simple control method that imposes a collinearity constraint on the parameters, and analyze a worst-case scenario where both classes have the same size and all points are i.i.d. Our results highlight the benefits of high-dimensional spaces, showing that classification using constant controls becomes more probable as $d$ increases.

Abstract: Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics.\\ Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we present data stream algorithms to compute optimal splits for decision tree learning. In particular, given a data stream of observations \(x_i\) and their corresponding labels \(y_i\), without the i.i.d. assumption, the objective is to identify the optimal split \(j\) that partitions the data into two sets, minimizing the mean squared error (for regression) or the misclassification rate and Gini impurity (for classification). We propose several efficient streaming algorithms that require sublinear space and use a small number of passes to solve these problems. These algorithms can also be extended to the MapReduce model. Our results, while not directly comparable, complements the seminal work of Domingos-Hulten (KDD 2000) and Hulten-Spencer-Domingos (KDD 2001).

Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a fundamental model for decision making under uncertainty. They exhibit non-deterministic choice as well as probabilistic uncertainty. Traditionally, verification algorithms assume exact knowledge of the probabilities that govern the behaviour of an MDP. As this assumption is often unrealistic in practice, statistical model checking (SMC) was developed in the past two decades. It allows to analyse MDPs with unknown transition probabilities and provide probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the result. Model-based SMC algorithms sample the MDP and build a model of it by estimating all transition probabilities, essentially for every transition answering the question: ``What are the odds?'' However, so far the statistical methods employed by the state of the art SMC algorithms are quite naive. Our contribution are several fundamental improvements to those methods: On the one hand, we survey statistics literature for better concentration inequalities; on the other hand, we propose specialised approaches that exploit our knowledge of the MDP. Our improvements are generally applicable to many kinds of problem statements because they are largely independent of the setting. Moreover, our experimental evaluation shows that they lead to significant gains, reducing the number of samples that the SMC algorithm has to collect by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Although there has been a growing interest among industries in integrating generative LLMs into their services, limited experience and scarcity of resources act as a barrier in launching and servicing large-scale LLM-based services. In this paper, we share our experiences in developing and operating generative AI models within a national-scale search engine, with a specific focus on the sensitiveness of user queries. We propose a taxonomy for sensitive search queries, outline our approaches, and present a comprehensive analysis report on sensitive queries from actual users. We believe that our experiences in launching generative AI search systems can contribute to reducing the barrier in building generative LLM-based services.

<title>Improved impedance inversion by the iterated graph Laplacian</title>

arXiv:2404.16324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-adaptive inversion method that integrates classical or deep learning-based approaches with iterative graph Laplacian regularization, specifically targeting acoustic impedance inversion - a critical task in seismic exploration. Our method initiates from an impedance estimate derived using either traditional inversion techniques or neural network-based methods. This initial estimate guides the construction of a graph Laplacian operator, effectively capturing structural characteristics of the impedance profile. Utilizing a Tikhonov-inspired variational framework with this graph-informed prior, our approach iteratively updates and refines the impedance estimate while continuously recalibrating the graph Laplacian. This iterative refinement shows rapid convergence, increased accuracy, and enhanced robustness to noise compared to initial reconstructions alone. Extensive validation performed on synthetic and real seismic datasets across varying noise levels confirms the effectiveness of our method. Performance evaluations include four initial inversion methods: two classical techniques and two neural networks - previously established in the literature.

Abstract: While numerous frameworks have been developed to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there is a scarcity of methods that effectively balance the trade-off between cost and quality. In this paper, we introduce Fleet of Agents (FoA), a novel and intuitive yet principled framework utilizing LLMs as agents to navigate through dynamic tree searches, employing a genetic-type particle filtering approach. FoA spawns a multitude of agents, each exploring the search space autonomously, followed by a selection phase where resampling based on a heuristic value function optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation. This mechanism enables dynamic branching, adapting the exploration strategy based on discovered solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark tasks, ``Game of 24'', ``Mini-Crosswords'', and ``WebShop'', utilizing four different LLMs, ``GPT-3.5'', ``GPT-4'', ``LLaMA3.2-11B'', and ``LLaMA3.2-90B''. On average across all tasks and LLMs, FoA obtains a quality improvement of ~5% while requiring only ~40% of the cost of previous SOTA methods. Notably, our analyses reveal that (1) FoA achieves the best cost-quality trade-off among all benchmarked methods and (2) FoA + LLaMA3.2-11B surpasses the Llama3.2-90B model. FoA is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/FoA.

<title>Dynamic angular synchronization under smoothness constraints</title>

Abstract: Given an undirected measurement graph $\mathcal{H} = ([n], \mathcal{E})$, the classical angular synchronization problem consists of recovering unknown angles $\theta_1^*,\dots,\theta_n^*$ from a collection of noisy pairwise measurements of the form $(\theta_i^* - \theta_j^*) \mod 2\pi$, for all $\{i,j\} \in \mathcal{E}$. This problem arises in a variety of applications, including computer vision, time synchronization of distributed networks, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. In this paper, we consider a dynamic version of this problem where the angles, and also the measurement graphs evolve over $T$ time points. Assuming a smoothness condition on the evolution of the latent angles, we derive three algorithms for joint estimation of the angles over all time points. Moreover, for one of the algorithms, we establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the mean-squared error (MSE) under different statistical models. In particular, we show that the MSE converges to zero as $T$ increases under milder conditions than in the static setting. This includes the setting where the measurement graphs are highly sparse and disconnected, and also when the measurement noise is large and can potentially increase with $T$. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic data.

<title>Large-Scale Contextual Market Equilibrium Computation through Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.

<title>ScoreFusion: Fusing Score-based Generative Models via Kullback-Leibler Barycenters</title>

Abstract: We introduce ScoreFusion, a theoretically grounded method for fusing multiple pre-trained diffusion models that are assumed to generate from auxiliary populations. ScoreFusion is particularly useful for enhancing the generative modeling of a target population with limited observed data. Our starting point considers the family of KL barycenters of the auxiliary populations, which is proven to be an optimal parametric class in the KL sense, but difficult to learn. Nevertheless, by recasting the learning problem as score matching in denoising diffusion, we obtain a tractable way of computing the optimal KL barycenter weights. We prove a dimension-free sample complexity bound in total variation distance, provided that the auxiliary models are well-fitted for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. The sample efficiency of ScoreFusion is demonstrated by learning handwritten digits. We also provide a simple adaptation of a Stable Diffusion denoising pipeline that enables sampling from the KL barycenter of two auxiliary checkpoints; on a portrait generation task, our method produces faces that enhance population heterogeneity relative to the auxiliary distributions.

<title>The Impact of Environment Configurations on the Stability of AI-Enabled Systems</title>

arXiv:2408.02825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, software systems tend to include Artificial Intelligence (AI) components. Changes in the operational environment have been known to negatively impact the stability of AI-enabled software systems by causing unintended changes in behavior. However, how an environment configuration impacts the behavior of such systems has yet to be explored. Understanding and quantifying the degree of instability caused by different environment settings can help practitioners decide the best environment configuration for the most stable AI systems. To achieve this goal, we performed experiments with eight different combinations of three key environment variables (operating system, Python version, and CPU architecture) on $30$ open-source AI-enabled systems using the Travis CI platform. We determine the existence and the degree of instability introduced by each configuration using three metrics: the output of an AI component of the system (model performance), the time required to build and run the system (processing time), and the cost associated with building and running the system (expense). Our results indicate that changes in environment configurations lead to instability across all three metrics; however, it is observed more frequently with respect to processing time and expense rather than model performance. For example, between Linux and MacOS, instability is observed in 23\%, 96.67\%, and 100\% of the studied projects in model performance, processing time, and expense, respectively. Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the optimal combination of configuration settings to mitigate drops in model performance and reduce the processing time and expense before deploying an AI-enabled system.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) advancements sparked a growing research interest in tool assisted LLMs solving real-world challenges, which calls for comprehensive evaluation of tool-use capabilities. While previous works focused on either evaluating over stateless web services (RESTful API), based on a single turn user prompt, or an off-policy dialog trajectory, ToolSandbox includes stateful tool execution, implicit state dependencies between tools, a built-in user simulator supporting on-policy conversational evaluation and a dynamic evaluation strategy for intermediate and final milestones over an arbitrary trajectory. We show that open source and proprietary models have a significant performance gap, and complex tasks like State Dependency, Canonicalization and Insufficient Information defined in ToolSandbox are challenging even the most capable SOTA LLMs, providing brand-new insights into tool-use LLM capabilities. ToolSandbox evaluation framework is released at https://github.com/apple/ToolSandbox

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, the first fully client-side anti-phishing framework built on a lightweight ensemble framework that utilizes advanced language models to analyze the contextual features of a website's source code and URL. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning approaches that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to evolving threats, or deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our approach utilizes MobileBERT, a fast and memory-efficient variant of the BERT architecture, to capture nuanced features indicative of phishing attacks. To further enhance detection accuracy, PhishLang employs a multi-modal ensemble approach, combining both the URL and Source detection models. This architecture ensures robustness by allowing one model to compensate for scenarios where the other may fail, or if both models provide ambiguous inferences. As a result, PhishLang excels at detecting both regular and evasive phishing threats, including zero-day attacks, outperforming popular anti-phishing tools, while operating without relying on external blocklists and safeguarding user privacy by ensuring that browser history remains entirely local and unshared. We release PhishLang as a Chromium browser extension and also open-source the framework to aid the research community.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionise the field of automotive aerodynamics, enabling split-second flow predictions early in the design process. However, the lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars, using high-fidelity CFD methods, represents a barrier to their development. To address this, a high-fidelity open-source (CC-BY-SA) public dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been generated, based on 500 parametrically morphed variants of the widely-used DrivAer notchback generic vehicle. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD was executed using consistent and validated automatic workflows representative of the industrial state-of-the-art. Geometries and rich aerodynamic data are published in open-source formats. To our knowledge, this is the first large, public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations generated using high-fidelity CFD.

Abstract: Recent growth and proliferation of malware have tested practitioners ability to promptly classify new samples according to malware families. In contrast to labor-intensive reverse engineering efforts, machine learning approaches have demonstrated increased speed and accuracy. However, most existing deep-learning malware family classifiers must be calibrated using a large number of samples that are painstakingly manually analyzed before training. Furthermore, as novel malware samples arise that are beyond the scope of the training set, additional reverse engineering effort must be employed to update the training set. The sheer volume of new samples found in the wild creates substantial pressure on practitioners ability to reverse engineer enough malware to adequately train modern classifiers. In this paper, we present MalMixer, a malware family classifier using semi-supervised learning that achieves high accuracy with sparse training data. We present a domain-knowledge-aware data augmentation technique for malware feature representations, enhancing few-shot performance of semi-supervised malware family classification. We show that MalMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot malware family classification settings. Our research confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of lightweight, domain-knowledge-aware data augmentation methods for malware features and shows the capabilities of similar semi-supervised classifiers in addressing malware classification issues.

Abstract: Advances in robot learning have enabled robots to generate skills for a variety of tasks. Yet, robot learning is typically sample inefficient, struggles to learn from data sources exhibiting varied behaviors, and does not naturally incorporate constraints. These properties are critical for fast, agile tasks such as playing table tennis. Modern techniques for learning from demonstration improve sample efficiency and scale to diverse data, but are rarely evaluated on agile tasks. In the case of reinforcement learning, achieving good performance requires training on high-fidelity simulators. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel diffusion modeling approach that is offline, constraint-guided, and expressive of diverse agile behaviors. The key to our approach is a kinematic constraint gradient guidance (KCGG) technique that computes gradients through both the forward kinematics of the robot arm and the diffusion model to direct the sampling process. KCGG minimizes the cost of violating constraints while simultaneously keeping the sampled trajectory in-distribution of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for time-critical robotic tasks by evaluating KCGG in two challenging domains: simulated air hockey and real table tennis. In simulated air hockey, we achieved a 25.4% increase in block rate, while in table tennis, we saw a 17.3% increase in success rate compared to imitation learning baselines.

Abstract: We present a sequential version of the kernelized Stein discrepancy goodness-of-fit test, which allows for conducting goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized densities that are continuously monitored and adaptively stopped. That is, the sample size need not be fixed prior to data collection; the practitioner can choose whether to stop the test or continue to gather evidence at any time while controlling the false discovery rate. In stark contrast to related literature, we do not impose uniform boundedness on the Stein kernel. Instead, we exploit the potential boundedness of the Stein kernel at arbitrary point evaluations to define test martingales, that give way to the subsequent novel sequential tests. We prove the validity of the test, as well as an asymptotic lower bound for the logarithmic growth of the wealth process under the alternative. We further illustrate the empirical performance of the test with a variety of distributions, including restricted Boltzmann machines.

Abstract: The complexity of the cardiovascular system needs to be accurately reproduced in order to promptly acknowledge health conditions; to this aim, advanced multifidelity and multiphysics numerical models are crucial. On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Despite advances in diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) methods, efficient, high-quality generation remains a challenge. We introduce Presto!, an approach to inference acceleration for score-based diffusion transformers via reducing both sampling steps and cost per step. To reduce steps, we develop a new score-based distribution matching distillation (DMD) method for the EDM-family of diffusion models, the first GAN-based distillation method for TTM. To reduce the cost per step, we develop a simple, but powerful improvement to a recent layer distillation method that improves learning via better preserving hidden state variance. Finally, we combine our step and layer distillation methods together for a dual-faceted approach. We evaluate our step and layer distillation methods independently and show each yield best-in-class performance. Our combined distillation method can generate high-quality outputs with improved diversity, accelerating our base model by 10-18x (230/435ms latency for 32 second mono/stereo 44.1kHz, 15x faster than comparable SOTA) -- the fastest high-quality TTM to our knowledge. Sound examples can be found at https://presto-music.github.io/web/.

<title>Evaluating Semantic Variation in Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Causal Perspective</title>

arXiv:2410.10291v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench .

<title>In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate</title>

arXiv:2410.12876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.

Abstract: Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.

Abstract: Evidence-based deep learning represents a burgeoning paradigm for uncertainty estimation, offering reliable predictions with negligible extra computational overheads. Existing methods usually adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence to estimate the uncertainty of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps among various modalities. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a novel algorithm based on H\"older Divergence (HD) to enhance the reliability of multi-view learning by addressing inherent uncertainty challenges from incomplete or noisy data. Generally, our method extracts the representations of multiple modalities through parallel network branches, and then employs HD to estimate the prediction uncertainties. Through the Dempster-Shafer theory, integration of uncertainty from different modalities, thereby generating a comprehensive result that considers all available representations. Mathematically, HD proves to better measure the ``distance'' between real data distribution and predictive distribution of the model and improve the performances of multi-class recognition tasks.
  Specifically, our method surpass the existing state-of-the-art counterparts on all evaluating benchmarks.
  We further conduct extensive experiments on different backbones to verify our superior robustness. It is demonstrated that our method successfully pushes the corresponding performance boundaries. Finally, we perform experiments on more challenging scenarios, \textit{i.e.}, learning with incomplete or noisy data, revealing that our method exhibits a high tolerance to such corrupted data.

Abstract: The growing reliance on renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, has introduced challenges due to their uncontrollable production. This complicates maintaining the electrical grid balance, prompting some transmission system operators in Western Europe to implement imbalance tariffs that penalize unsustainable power deviations. These tariffs create an implicit demand response framework to mitigate grid instability. Yet, several challenges limit active participation. In Belgium, for example, imbalance prices are only calculated at the end of each 15-minute settlement period, creating high risk due to price uncertainty. This risk is further amplified by the inherent volatility of imbalance prices, discouraging participation. Although transmission system operators provide minute-based price predictions, the system imbalance volatility makes accurate price predictions challenging to obtain and requires sophisticated techniques. Moreover, publishing price estimates can prompt participants to adjust their schedules, potentially affecting the system balance and the final price, adding further complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search method that publishes accurate imbalance prices while accounting for potential response actions. Our approach models the system dynamics using a neural network forecaster and a cluster of virtual batteries controlled by reinforcement learning agents. Compared to Belgium's current publication method, our technique improves price accuracy by 20.4% under ideal conditions and by 12.8% in more realistic scenarios. This research addresses an unexplored, yet crucial problem, positioning this paper as a pioneering work in analyzing the potential of more advanced imbalance price publishing techniques.

Abstract: Biophysical model fitting plays a key role in obtaining quantitative parameters from physiological signals and images. However, the model complexity for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often translates into excessive computation time, which makes clinical use impractical. Here, we present a generic computational approach for solving the parameter extraction inverse problem posed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling coupled with experimental measurement of the system dynamics. This is achieved by formulating a numerical ODE solver to function as a step-wise analytical one, thereby making it compatible with automatic differentiation-based optimization. This enables efficient gradient-based model fitting, and provides a new approach to parameter quantification based on self-supervised learning from a single data observation. The neural-network-based train-by-fit pipeline was used to quantify semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) amide proton exchange parameters in the human brain, in an in-vivo molecular MRI study (n = 4). The entire pipeline of the first whole brain quantification was completed in 18.3 $\pm$ 8.3 minutes. Reusing the single-subject-trained network for inference in new subjects took 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 s, to provide results in agreement with literature values and scan-specific fit results.

<title>IdentifyMe: A Challenging Long-Context Mention Resolution Benchmark for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent evaluations of LLMs on coreference resolution have revealed that traditional output formats and evaluation metrics do not fully capture the models' referential understanding. To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a new benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long narratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions, creating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated mixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open source LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%) between the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe that pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically much harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find that LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested structures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy, highlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while also indicating room for further improvement.

Abstract: In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers are computationally expensive, and Mambas face CUDA dependence and local correlation loss. In this paper, we propose CDXLSTM, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: At the time of environmental concerns about artificial intelligence, in particular its need for greedy storage and computation, sparsity inducing neural networks offer a promising path towards frugality and solution for less waste.
  Sparse learners compress the inputs (features) by selecting only the ones needed for good generalization. A human scientist can then give an intelligent interpretation to the few selected features. If genes are the inputs and cancer type is the output, then the selected genes give the cancerologist clues on what genes have an effect on certain cancers. LASSO-type regularization leads to good input selection for linear associations, but few attempts have been made for nonlinear associations modeled as an artificial neural network. A stringent but efficient way of testing whether a feature selection method works is to check if a phase transition occurs in the probability of retrieving the relevant features, as observed and mathematically studied for linear models. Our method achieves just so for artificial neural networks, and, on real data, it has the best compromise between number of selected features and generalization performance.
  Our method is flexible, applying to complex models ranging from shallow to deep artificial neural networks and supporting various cost functions and sparsity-promoting penalties. It does not rely on cross-validation or on a validation set to select its single regularization parameter making it user-friendly. Our approach can be seen as a form of compressed sensing for complex models, allowing to distill high-dimensional data into a compact, interpretable subset of meaningful features, just the opposite of a black box.
  A python package is available at https://github.com/VcMaxouuu/AnnHarderLasso containing all the simulations and ready-to-use models.

Abstract: Spontaneous or conversational multilingual speech presents many challenges for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this work, we present a new technique AMPS that augments a multilingual multimodal ASR system with paraphrase-based supervision for improved conversational ASR in multiple languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, and Nyanja. We use paraphrases of the reference transcriptions as additional supervision while training the multimodal ASR model and selectively invoke this paraphrase objective for utterances with poor ASR performance. Using AMPS with a state-of-the-art multimodal model SeamlessM4T, we obtain significant relative reductions in word error rates (WERs) of up to 5%. We present detailed analyses of our system using both objective and human evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The use of large-scale, web-scraped datasets to train face recognition models has raised significant privacy and bias concerns. Synthetic methods mitigate these concerns and provide scalable and controllable face generation to enable fair and accurate face recognition. However, existing synthetic datasets display limited intraclass and interclass diversity and do not match the face recognition performance obtained using real datasets. Here, we propose VariFace, a two-stage diffusion-based pipeline to create fair and diverse synthetic face datasets to train face recognition models. Specifically, we introduce three methods: Face Recognition Consistency to refine demographic labels, Face Vendi Score Guidance to improve interclass diversity, and Divergence Score Conditioning to balance the identity preservation-intraclass diversity trade-off. When constrained to the same dataset size, VariFace considerably outperforms previous synthetic datasets (0.9200 $\rightarrow$ 0.9405) and achieves comparable performance to face recognition models trained with real data (Real Gap = -0.0065). In an unconstrained setting, VariFace not only consistently achieves better performance compared to previous synthetic methods across dataset sizes but also, for the first time, outperforms the real dataset (CASIA-WebFace) across six evaluation datasets. This sets a new state-of-the-art performance with an average face verification accuracy of 0.9567 (Real Gap = +0.0097) across LFW, CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, and CALFW datasets and 0.9366 (Real Gap = +0.0380) on the RFW dataset.

Abstract: A collaboration between dataset owners and model owners is needed to facilitate effective machine learning (ML) training. During this collaboration, however, dataset owners and model owners want to protect the confidentiality of their respective assets (i.e., datasets, models and training code), with the dataset owners also caring about the privacy of individual users whose data is in their datasets. Existing solutions either provide limited confidentiality for models and training code, or suffer from privacy issues due to collusion.
  We present Citadel++, a collaborative ML training system designed to simultaneously protect the confidentiality of datasets, models and training code as well as the privacy of individual users. Citadel++ enhances differential privacy mechanisms to safeguard the privacy of individual user data while maintaining model utility. By employing Virtual Machine-level Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as well as the improved sandboxing and integrity mechanisms through OS-level techniques, Citadel++ effectively preserves the confidentiality of datasets, models and training code, and enforces our privacy mechanisms even when the models and training code have been maliciously designed. Our experiments show that Citadel++ provides model utility and performance while adhering to the confidentiality and privacy requirements of dataset owners and model owners, outperforming the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving training systems by up to 543x on CPU and 113x on GPU TEEs.

Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical probabilistic approach to go from a 2D image to multiview 3D: a diffusion "prior" predicts the unseen 3D geometry, which then conditions a diffusion "decoder" to generate novel views of the subject. We use a pointmap-based geometric representation to coordinate the generation of multiple target views simultaneously. We construct a predictable distribution of geometric features per target view to enable learnability across examples, and generalization to arbitrary inputs images. Our modular, geometry-driven approach to novel-view synthesis (called "unPIC") beats competing baselines such as CAT3D, EscherNet, Free3D, and One-2-3-45 on held-out objects from ObjaverseXL, as well as unseen real-world objects from Google Scanned Objects, Amazon Berkeley Objects, and the Digital Twin Catalog.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly progressed in offline video understanding. However, applying these models to real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, presents unique challenges due to the need for real-time processing of continuous online video streams. To this end, this paper presents systematic efforts from three perspectives: evaluation benchmark, model architecture, and training strategy. First, we introduce OVBench, a comprehensive question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to perceive, memorize, and reason within online video contexts. It features 6 core task types across three temporal contexts-past, current, and future-forming 16 subtasks from diverse datasets. Second, we propose a new Pyramid Memory Bank (PMB) that effectively retains key spatiotemporal information in video streams. Third, we proposed an offline-to-online learning paradigm, designing an interleaved dialogue format for online video data and constructing an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for online video training. This framework led to the development of VideoChat-Online, a robust and efficient model for online video understanding. Despite the lower computational cost and higher efficiency, VideoChat-Online outperforms existing state-of-the-art offline and online models across popular offline video benchmarks and OVBench, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model architecture and training strategy. % Our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art offline models Qwen2-VL 7B and online models Flash-VStream, by 4.19% and 23.7% on OVBench, respectively.

Abstract: Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g., work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However, with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.

Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade, yet due to their complexity, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.

Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays fundamental roles in biological systems, from carrying genetic information to performing enzymatic function. Understanding and designing RNA can enable novel therapeutic application and biotechnological innovation. To enhance RNA design, in this paper we introduce RiboGen, the first deep learning model to simultaneously generate RNA sequence and all-atom 3D structure. RiboGen leverages the standard Flow Matching with Discrete Flow Matching in a multimodal data representation. RiboGen is based on Euclidean Equivariant neural networks for efficiently processing and learning three-dimensional geometry. Our experiments show that RiboGen can efficiently generate chemically plausible and self-consistent RNA samples, suggesting that co-generation of sequence and structure is a competitive approach for modeling RNA.

Abstract: Over the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in engineering domains has gained significant popularity, showcasing their potential in data-driven contexts. However, the complexity and diversity of engineering problems often require the development of domain-specific AI approaches, which are frequently hindered by a lack of systematic methodologies, scalability, and robustness during the development process. To address this gap, this paper introduces the "ABCDE" as the key elements of Engineering AI and proposes a unified, systematic engineering AI ecosystem framework, including eight essential layers, along with attributes, goals, and applications, to guide the development and deployment of AI solutions for specific engineering needs. Additionally, key challenges are examined, and eight future research directions are highlighted. By providing a comprehensive perspective, this paper aims to advance the strategic implementation of AI, fostering the development of next-generation engineering AI solutions.

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. By simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications. We release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems -- and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance -- remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modeling certain physical systems.

Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the factual accuracy and domain adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.

<title>Understanding LLM Behaviors via Compression: Data Generation, Knowledge Acquisition and Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.

Abstract: In contemporary society, widespread social media usage is evident in people's daily lives. Nevertheless, disparities in emotional expressions between the real world and online platforms can manifest. We comprehensively analyzed Persian community on X to explore this phenomenon. An innovative pipeline was designed to measure the similarity between emotions in the real world compared to social media. Accordingly, recent tweets and images of participants were gathered and analyzed using Transformers-based text and image sentiment analysis modules. Each participant's friends also provided insights into the their real-world emotions. A distance criterion was used to compare real-world feelings with virtual experiences. Our study encompassed N=105 participants, 393 friends who contributed their perspectives, over 8,300 collected tweets, and 2,000 media images. Results indicated a 28.67% similarity between images and real-world emotions, while tweets exhibited a 75.88% alignment with real-world feelings. Additionally, the statistical significance confirmed that the observed disparities in sentiment proportions.

<title>CI-RKM: A Class-Informed Approach to Robust Restricted Kernel Machines</title>

Abstract: Restricted kernel machines (RKMs) represent a versatile and powerful framework within the kernel machine family, leveraging conjugate feature duality to address a wide range of machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and feature learning. However, their performance can degrade significantly in the presence of noise and outliers, which compromises robustness and predictive accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel enhancement to the RKM framework by integrating a class-informed weighted function. This weighting mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of individual training points based on their proximity to class centers and class-specific characteristics, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of noisy and outlier data. By incorporating weighted conjugate feature duality and leveraging the Schur complement theorem, we introduce the class-informed restricted kernel machine (CI-RKM), a robust extension of the RKM designed to improve generalization and resilience to data imperfections. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CI-RKM consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior classification accuracy and enhanced robustness against noise and outliers. Our proposed method establishes a significant advancement in the development of kernel-based learning models, addressing a core challenge in the field.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose an LLM-based AI agent for AMS circuit design to assist in the sizing process. By integrating LLMs with external circuit simulation tools and data analysis functions and employing prompt engineering strategies, the agent successfully optimized multiple circuits to achieve target performance metrics. We evaluated the performance of different LLMs to assess their applicability and optimization effectiveness across seven basic circuits, and selected the best-performing model Claude 3.5 Sonnet for further exploration on an operational amplifier, with complementary input stage and class AB output stage. This circuit was evaluated against nine performance metrics, and we conducted experiments under three distinct performance requirement groups. A success rate of up to 60% was achieved for reaching the target requirements. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve AMS circuit design.

<title>Cross-cultural Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles Using Data-light Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: More than the adherence to specific traffic regulations, driving culture touches upon a more implicit part - an informal, conventional, collective behavioral pattern followed by drivers - that varies across countries, regions, and even cities. Such cultural divergence has become one of the biggest challenges in deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs) across diverse regions today. The current emergence of data-driven methods has shown a potential solution to enable culture-compatible driving through learning from data, but what if some underdeveloped regions cannot provide sufficient local data to inform driving culture? This issue is particularly significant for a broader global AV market. Here, we propose a cross-cultural deployment scheme for AVs, called data-light inverse reinforcement learning, designed to re-calibrate culture-specific AVs and assimilate them into other cultures. First, we report the divergence in driving cultures through a comprehensive comparative analysis of naturalistic driving datasets on highways from three countries: Germany, China, and the USA. Then, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by testing the expeditious cross-cultural deployment across these three countries, with cumulative testing mileage of over 56084 km. The performance is particularly advantageous when cross-cultural deployment is carried out without affluent local data. Results show that we can reduce the dependence on local data by a margin of 98.67% at best. This study is expected to bring a broader, fairer AV global market, particularly in those regions that lack enough local data to develop culture-compatible AVs.

<title>Reward Distance Comparisons Under Transition Sparsity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward comparisons are vital for evaluating differences in agent behaviors induced by a set of reward functions. Most conventional techniques utilize the input reward functions to learn optimized policies, which are then used to compare agent behaviors. However, learning these policies can be computationally expensive and can also raise safety concerns. Direct reward comparison techniques obviate policy learning but suffer from transition sparsity, where only a small subset of transitions are sampled due to data collection challenges and feasibility constraints. Existing state-of-the-art direct reward comparison methods are ill-suited for these sparse conditions since they require high transition coverage, where the majority of transitions from a given coverage distribution are sampled. When this requirement is not satisfied, a distribution mismatch between sampled and expected transitions can occur, leading to significant errors. This paper introduces the Sparsity Resilient Reward Distance (SRRD) pseudometric, designed to eliminate the need for high transition coverage by accommodating diverse sample distributions, which are common under transition sparsity. We provide theoretical justification for SRRD's robustness and conduct experiments to demonstrate its practical efficacy across multiple domains.

<title>Position Paper: Rethinking Privacy in RL for Sequential Decision-making in the Age of LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications demands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy frameworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential decision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics. Modern RL paradigms, such as federated RL (FedRL) and RL with human feedback (RLHF) in large language models (LLMs), exacerbate these challenges by introducing complex, interactive, and context-dependent learning environments that traditional methods do not address. In this position paper, we argue for a new privacy paradigm built on four core principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation. These principles expose inherent tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability that must be navigated as RL systems become more pervasive in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems powered by LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we call for the development of new theoretical frameworks, practical mechanisms, and rigorous evaluation methodologies that collectively enable effective privacy protection in sequential decision-making systems.

<title>Multi-output Classification Framework and Frequency Layer Normalization for Compound Fault Diagnosis in Motor</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11513</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a multi-output classification (MOC) framework designed for domain adaptation in fault diagnosis, particularly under partially labeled (PL) target domain scenarios and compound fault conditions in rotating machinery. Unlike traditional multi-class classification (MCC) methods that treat each fault combination as a distinct class, the proposed approach independently estimates the severity of each fault type, improving both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. The model incorporates multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) and entropy minimization (EM) losses to facilitate feature transfer from the source to the target domain. In addition, frequency layer normalization (FLN) is applied to preserve structural properties in the frequency domain, which are strongly influenced by system dynamics and are often stationary with respect to changes in rpm. Evaluations across six domain adaptation cases with PL data demonstrate that MOC outperforms baseline models in macro F1 score. Moreover, MOC consistently achieves better classification performance for individual fault types, and FLN shows superior adaptability compared to other normalization techniques.

Abstract: Evaluating autonomous vehicles with controllability enables scalable testing in counterfactual or structured settings, enhancing both efficiency and safety. We introduce LangTraj, a language-conditioned scene-diffusion model that simulates the joint behavior of all agents in traffic scenarios. By conditioning on natural language inputs, LangTraj provides flexible and intuitive control over interactive behaviors, generating nuanced and realistic scenarios. Unlike prior approaches that depend on domain-specific guidance functions, LangTraj incorporates language conditioning during training, facilitating more intuitive traffic simulation control. We propose a novel closed-loop training strategy for diffusion models, explicitly tailored to enhance stability and realism during closed-loop simulation. To support language-conditioned simulation, we develop Inter-Drive, a large-scale dataset with diverse and interactive labels for training language-conditioned diffusion models. Our dataset is built upon a scalable pipeline for annotating agent-agent interactions and single-agent behaviors, ensuring rich and varied supervision. Validated on the Waymo Motion Dataset, LangTraj demonstrates strong performance in realism, language controllability, and language-conditioned safety-critical simulation, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and scalable autonomous vehicle testing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Error Broadcast and Decorrelation (EBD) algorithm, a novel learning framework that addresses the credit assignment problem in neural networks by directly broadcasting output error to individual layers. Leveraging the stochastic orthogonality property of the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator, EBD defines layerwise loss functions to penalize correlations between layer activations and output errors, offering a principled approach to error broadcasting without the need for weight transport. The optimization framework naturally leads to the experimentally observed three-factor learning rule and integrates with biologically plausible frameworks to enhance performance and plausibility. Numerical experiments demonstrate that EBD achieves performance comparable to or better than known error-broadcast methods on benchmark datasets. While the scalability of EBD to very large or complex datasets remains to be further explored, our findings suggest it provides a biologically plausible, efficient, and adaptable alternative for neural network training. This approach could inform future advancements in artificial and natural learning paradigms.

<title>Towards a Universal Vibration Analysis Dataset: A Framework for Transfer Learning in Predictive Maintenance and Structural Health Monitoring</title>

arXiv:2504.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ImageNet has become a reputable resource for transfer learning, allowing the development of efficient ML models with reduced training time and data requirements. However, vibration analysis in predictive maintenance, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis, lacks a comparable large-scale, annotated dataset to facilitate similar advancements. To address this, a dataset framework is proposed that begins with bearing vibration data as an initial step towards creating a universal dataset for vibration-based spectrogram analysis for all machinery. The initial framework includes a collection of bearing vibration signals from various publicly available datasets. To demonstrate the advantages of this framework, experiments were conducted using a deep learning architecture, showing improvements in model performance when pre-trained on bearing vibration data and fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. These findings highlight the potential to parallel the success of ImageNet in visual computing but for vibration analysis. For future work, this research will include a broader range of vibration signals from multiple types of machinery, emphasizing spectrogram-based representations of the data. Each sample will be labeled according to machinery type, operational status, and the presence or type of faults, ensuring its utility for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Additionally, a framework for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training specific to vibration data will be developed. This framework will standardize methodologies across the research community, allowing for collaboration and accelerating progress in predictive maintenance, structural health monitoring, and related fields. By mirroring the success of ImageNet in visual computing, this dataset has the potential to improve the development of intelligent systems in industrial applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving decision-making problems in dynamic environments. In this research, we explore the application of Double DQN (DDQN) and Dueling Network Architectures, to financial trading tasks using historical SP500 index data. Our focus is training agents capable of optimizing trading strategies while accounting for practical constraints such as transaction costs. The study evaluates the model performance across scenarios with and without commissions, highlighting the impact of cost-sensitive environments on reward dynamics. Despite computational limitations and the inherent complexity of financial time series data, the agent successfully learned meaningful trading policies. The findings confirm that RL agents, even when trained on limited datasets, can outperform random strategies by leveraging advanced architectures such as DDQN and Dueling Networks. However, significant challenges persist, particularly with a sub-optimal policy due to the complexity of data source.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection, which detects errors and failures in a workflow, is one of the most important topics in real-world applications. The purpose of time-series anomaly detection is to reduce potential damages or losses. However, existing anomaly detection models detect anomalies through the error between the model output and the ground truth (observed) value, which makes them impractical. In this work, we present a \textit{proactive} approach for time-series anomaly detection based on a time-series forecasting model specialized for anomaly detection and a data-driven anomaly detection model. Our proactive approach establishes an anomaly threshold from training data with a data-driven anomaly detection model, and anomalies are subsequently detected by identifying predicted values that exceed the anomaly threshold. In addition, we extensively evaluated the model using four anomaly detection benchmarks and analyzed both predictable and unpredictable anomalies. We attached the source code as supplementary material.

<title>Achieving Tighter Finite-Time Rates for Heterogeneous Federated Stochastic Approximation under Markovian Sampling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization with time-correlated data, we study a generic federated stochastic approximation problem involving $M$ agents, where each agent is characterized by an agent-specific (potentially nonlinear) local operator. The goal is for the agents to communicate intermittently via a server to find the root of the average of the agents' local operators. The generality of our setting stems from allowing for (i) Markovian data at each agent and (ii) heterogeneity in the roots of the agents' local operators. The limited recent work that has accounted for both these features in a federated setting fails to guarantee convergence to the desired point or to show any benefit of collaboration; furthermore, they rely on projection steps in their algorithms to guarantee bounded iterates. Our work overcomes each of these limitations. We develop a novel algorithm titled \texttt{FedHSA}, and prove that it guarantees convergence to the correct point, while enjoying an $M$-fold linear speedup in sample-complexity due to collaboration. To our knowledge, \emph{this is the first finite-time result of its kind}, and establishing it (without relying on a projection step) entails a fairly intricate argument that accounts for the interplay between complex temporal correlations due to Markovian sampling, multiple local steps to save communication, and the drift-effects induced by heterogeneous local operators. Our results have implications for a broad class of heterogeneous federated RL problems (e.g., policy evaluation and control) with function approximation, where the agents' Markov decision processes can differ in their probability transition kernels and reward functions.

<title>70% Size, 100% Accuracy: Lossless LLM Compression for Efficient GPU Inference via Dynamic-Length Float</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown rapidly in size, creating significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic-Length Float (DFloat11), a lossless compression framework that reduces LLM size by 30% while preserving outputs that are bit-for-bit identical to the original model. DFloat11 is motivated by the low entropy in the BFloat16 weight representation of LLMs, which reveals significant inefficiency in existing storage format. By applying entropy coding, DFloat11 assigns dynamic-length encodings to weights based on frequency, achieving near information-optimal compression without any loss of precision. To facilitate efficient inference with dynamic-length encodings, we develop a custom GPU kernel for fast online decompression. Our design incorporates the following: (i) decomposition of memory-intensive lookup tables (LUTs) into compact LUTs that fit in GPU SRAM, (ii) a two-phase kernel for coordinating thread read/write positions using lightweight auxiliary variables, and (iii) transformer-block-level decompression to minimize latency. Experiments on recent models, including Llama-3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Gemma-3, validates our hypothesis that DFloat11 achieves around 30% model size reduction while preserving bit-for-bit exact outputs. Compared to a potential alternative of offloading parts of an uncompressed model to the CPU to meet memory constraints, DFloat11 achieves 1.9-38.8x higher throughput in token generation. With a fixed GPU memory budget, DFloat11 enables 5.3-13.17x longer context lengths than uncompressed models. Notably, our method enables lossless inference of Llama-3.1-405B, an 810GB model, on a single node equipped with 8x80GB GPUs. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle to balance heterophily and homophily in representation learning, a challenge further amplified in self-supervised settings. We propose H$^3$GNNs, an end-to-end self-supervised learning framework that harmonizes both structural properties through two key innovations: (i) Joint Structural Node Encoding. We embed nodes into a unified space combining linear and non-linear feature projections with K-hop structural representations via a Weighted Graph Convolution Network(WGCN). A cross-attention mechanism enhances awareness and adaptability to heterophily and homophily. (ii) Self-Supervised Learning Using Teacher-Student Predictive Architectures with Node-Difficulty Driven Dynamic Masking Strategies. We use a teacher-student model, the student sees the masked input graph and predicts node features inferred by the teacher that sees the full input graph in the joint encoding space. To enhance learning difficulty, we introduce two novel node-predictive-difficulty-based masking strategies. Experiments on seven benchmarks (four heterophily datasets and three homophily datasets) confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of H$^3$GNNs across diverse graph types. Our H$^3$GNNs achieves overall state-of-the-art performance on the four heterophily datasets, while retaining on-par performance to previous state-of-the-art methods on the three homophily datasets.

<title>Clustering and analysis of user behaviour in blockchain: A case study of Planet IX</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralised applications (dApps) that run on public blockchains have the benefit of trustworthiness and transparency as every activity that happens on the blockchain can be publicly traced through the transaction data. However, this introduces a potential privacy problem as this data can be tracked and analysed, which can reveal user-behaviour information. A user behaviour analysis pipeline was proposed to present how this type of information can be extracted and analysed to identify separate behavioural clusters that can describe how users behave in the game. The pipeline starts with the collection of transaction data, involving smart contracts, that is collected from a blockchain-based game called Planet IX. Both the raw transaction information and the transaction events are considered in the data collection. From this data, separate game actions can be formed and those are leveraged to present how and when the users conducted their in-game activities in the form of user flows. An extended version of these user flows also presents how the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are being leveraged in the user actions. The latter is given as input for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to provide graph embeddings for these flows which then can be leveraged by clustering algorithms to cluster user behaviours into separate behavioural clusters. We benchmark and compare well-known clustering algorithms as a part of the proposed method. The user behaviour clusters were analysed and visualised in a graph format. It was found that behavioural information can be extracted regarding the users that belong to these clusters. Such information can be exploited by malicious users to their advantage. To demonstrate this, a privacy threat model was also presented based on the results that correspond to multiple potentially affected areas.

Abstract: We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.

<title>Saga: Capturing Multi-granularity Semantics from Massive Unlabelled IMU Data for User Perception</title>

Abstract: Inertial measurement units (IMUs), have been prevalently used in a wide range of mobile perception applications such as activity recognition and user authentication, where a large amount of labelled data are normally required to train a satisfactory model. However, it is difficult to label micro-activities in massive IMU data due to the hardness of understanding raw IMU data and the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained user perception approach, called Saga, which only needs a small amount of labelled IMU data to achieve stunning user perception accuracy. The core idea of Saga is to first pre-train a backbone feature extraction model, utilizing the rich semantic information of different levels embedded in the massive unlabelled IMU data. Meanwhile, for a specific downstream user perception application, Bayesian Optimization is employed to determine the optimal weights for pre-training tasks involving different semantic levels. We implement Saga on five typical mobile phones and evaluate Saga on three typical tasks on three IMU datasets. Results show that when only using about 100 training samples per class, Saga can achieve over 90% accuracy of the full-fledged model trained on over ten thousands training samples with no additional system overhead.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) represents a class of state-space models (SSMs) characterized by a fixed state transition mechanism (the reservoir) and a flexible readout layer that maps from the state space. It is a paradigm of computational dynamical systems that harnesses the transient dynamics of high-dimensional state spaces for efficient processing of temporal data. Rooted in concepts from recurrent neural networks, RC achieves exceptional computational power by decoupling the training of the dynamic reservoir from the linear readout layer, thereby circumventing the complexities of gradient-based optimization. This work presents a systematic exploration of RC, addressing its foundational properties such as the echo state property, fading memory, and reservoir capacity through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We formalize the interplay between input signals and reservoir states, demonstrating the conditions under which reservoirs exhibit stability and expressive power. Further, we delve into the computational trade-offs and robustness characteristics of RC architectures, extending the discussion to their applications in signal processing, time-series prediction, and control systems. The analysis is complemented by theoretical insights into optimization, training methodologies, and scalability, highlighting open challenges and potential directions for advancing the theoretical underpinnings of RC.

Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly advancing due to GNNs' capacity to learn distributed representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing large volumes of real-world graph data for GNN training is often impractical due to privacy concerns, regulatory restrictions, and commercial competition. Federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm, offers a solution by preserving data privacy with collaborative model training. Despite progress in training huge vision and language models, federated learning for GNNs remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for federated learning on GNNs based on spectral GNNs equipped with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) for better information capture, showing promising results across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Our approach effectively handles non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, while also achieving performance comparable to existing methods that only operate on IID data. It is designed to be privacy-preserving and bandwidth-optimized, making it suitable for real-world applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, which often involve complex, non-IID, and heterophilic graph structures. Our results in the area of federated learning on non-IID heterophilic graphs demonstrate significant improvements, while also achieving better performance on homophilic graphs. This work highlights the potential of federated learning in diverse and challenging graph settings. Open-source code available on GitHub (https://github.com/SpringWiz11/Fed-GNODEFormer).

Abstract: System identification has greatly benefited from deep learning techniques, particularly for modeling complex, nonlinear dynamical systems with partially unknown physics where traditional approaches may not be feasible. However, deep learning models often require large datasets and significant computational resources at training and inference due to their high-dimensional parameterizations. To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that discovers a low-dimensional manifold within the parameter space of an over-parameterized neural network architecture. This manifold is learned from a meta-dataset of input-output sequences generated by a class of related dynamical systems, enabling efficient model training while preserving the network's expressive power for the considered system class. Unlike bilevel meta-learning approaches, our method employs an auxiliary neural network to map datasets directly onto the learned manifold, eliminating the need for costly second-order gradient computations during meta-training and reducing the number of first-order updates required in inference, which could be expensive for large models. We validate our approach on a family of Bouc-Wen oscillators, which is a well-studied nonlinear system identification benchmark. We demonstrate that we are able to learn accurate models even in small-data scenarios.

Abstract: LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

Abstract: Neural networks often have identifiable computational structures - components of the network which perform an interpretable algorithm or task - but the mechanisms by which these emerge and the best methods for detecting these structures are not well understood. In this paper we investigate the emergence of computational structure in a transformer-like model trained to simulate the physics of a particle system, where the transformer's attention mechanism is used to transfer information between particles. We show that (a) structures emerge in the attention heads of the transformer which learn to detect particle collisions, (b) the emergence of these structures is associated to degenerate geometry in the loss landscape, and (c) the dynamics of this emergence follows a power law. This suggests that these components are governed by a degenerate "effective potential". These results have implications for the convergence time of computational structure within neural networks and suggest that the emergence of computational structure can be detected by studying the dynamics of network components.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become increasingly popular and deployed in safety-critical applications. In such applications, we want to give certified probabilistic guarantees on performance under adversarial attacks. We propose a novel method, CIVET, for certified training of VAEs. CIVET depends on the key insight that we can bound worst-case VAE error by bounding the error on carefully chosen support sets at the latent layer. We show this point mathematically and present a novel training algorithm utilizing this insight. We show in an extensive evaluation across different datasets (in both the wireless and vision application areas), architectures, and perturbation magnitudes that our method outperforms SOTA methods achieving good standard performance with strong robustness guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the problem of Best Arm Retention (BAR), which has recently found applications in streaming algorithms for multi-armed bandits. In the BAR problem, the goal is to retain $m$ arms with the best arm included from $n$ after some trials, in stochastic multi-armed bandit settings. We first investigate pure exploration for the BAR problem under different criteria, and then minimize the regret with specific constraints, in the context of further exploration in streaming algorithms.
  - We begin by revisiting the lower bound for the $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC algorithm for Best Arm Identification (BAI) and adapt the classical KL-divergence argument to derive optimal bounds for $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC algorithms for BAR.
  - We further study another variant of the problem, called $r$-BAR, which requires the expected gap between the best arm and the optimal arm retained is less than $r$. We prove tight sample complexity for the problem.
  - We explore the regret minimization problem for $r$-BAR and develop algorithm beyond pure exploration. We conclude with a conjecture on the optimal regret in this setting.

<title>Transferable Deployment of Semantic Edge Inference Systems via Unsupervised Domain Adaption</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates deploying semantic edge inference systems for performing a common image clarification task. In particular, each system consists of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices that first locally encode the sensing data into semantic features and then transmit them to an edge server for subsequent data fusion and task inference. The inference accuracy is determined by efficient training of the feature encoder/decoder using labeled data samples. Due to the difference in sensing data and communication channel distributions, deploying the system in a new environment may induce high costs in annotating data labels and re-training the encoder/decoder models. To achieve cost-effective transferable system deployment, we propose an efficient Domain Adaptation method for Semantic Edge INference systems (DASEIN) that can maintain high inference accuracy in a new environment without the need for labeled samples. Specifically, DASEIN exploits the task-relevant data correlation between different deployment scenarios by leveraging the techniques of unsupervised domain adaptation and knowledge distillation. It devises an efficient two-step adaptation procedure that sequentially aligns the data distributions and adapts to the channel variations. Numerical results show that, under a substantial change in sensing data distributions, the proposed DASEIN outperforms the best-performing benchmark method by 7.09% and 21.33% in inference accuracy when the new environment has similar or 25 dB lower channel signal to noise power ratios (SNRs), respectively. This verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting both data and channel distributions in practical transfer deployment applications.

Abstract: Typical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents for dynamic portfolio optimization learn the factors influencing portfolio return and risk by analyzing the output values of the reward function while adjusting portfolio weights within the training environment. However, it faces a major limitation where it is difficult for investors to intervene in the training based on different levels of risk aversion towards each portfolio asset. This difficulty arises from another limitation: existing DRL agents may not develop a thorough understanding of the factors responsible for the portfolio return and risk by only learning from the output of the reward function. As a result, the strategy for determining the target portfolio weights is entirely dependent on the DRL agents themselves. To address these limitations, we propose a reward factor matrix for elucidating the return and risk of each asset in the portfolio. Additionally, we propose a novel learning system named Factor-MCLS using a multi-critic framework that facilitates learning of the reward factor matrix. In this way, our DRL-based learning system can effectively learn the factors influencing portfolio return and risk. Moreover, based on the critic networks within the multi-critic framework, we develop a risk constraint term in the training objective function of the policy function. This risk constraint term allows investors to intervene in the training of the DRL agent according to their individual levels of risk aversion towards the portfolio assets.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has attracted considerable interest due to growing privacy concerns and regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which stresses the importance of privacy-preserving and fair machine learning approaches. In FL, model training takes place on decentralized data, so as to allow clients to upload a locally trained model and receive a globally aggregated model without exposing sensitive information. However, challenges related to fairness-such as biases, uneven performance among clients, and the "free rider" issue complicates its adoption. In this paper, we examine the use of Mutual Information (MI)-based loss functions to address these concerns. MI has proven to be a powerful method for measuring dependencies between variables and optimizing deep learning models. By leveraging MI to extract essential features and minimize biases, we aim to improve both the fairness and effectiveness of FL systems. Through extensive benchmarking, we assess the impact of MI-based losses in reducing disparities among clients while enhancing the overall performance of FL.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in solving both Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems due to their ability to efficiently model and capture the structural dependencies between literals and clauses. However, GNN methods for solving Weighted MaxSAT problems remain underdeveloped. The challenges arise from the non-linear dependency and sensitive objective function, which are caused by the non-uniform distribution of weights across clauses. In this paper, we present HyperSAT, a novel neural approach that employs an unsupervised hypergraph neural network model to solve Weighted MaxSAT problems. We propose a hypergraph representation for Weighted MaxSAT instances and design a cross-attention mechanism along with a shared representation constraint loss function to capture the logical interactions between positive and negative literal nodes in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on various Weighted MaxSAT datasets demonstrate that HyperSAT achieves better performance than state-of-the-art competitors.

<title>FedCanon: Non-Convex Composite Federated Learning with Efficient Proximal Operation on Heterogeneous Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite federated learning offers a general framework for solving machine learning problems with additional regularization terms. However, many existing methods require clients to perform multiple proximal operations to handle non-smooth terms and their performance are often susceptible to data heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel composite federated learning algorithm called \textbf{FedCanon}, designed to solve the optimization problems comprising a possibly non-convex loss function and a weakly convex, potentially non-smooth regularization term. By decoupling proximal mappings from local updates, FedCanon requires only a single proximal evaluation on the server per iteration, thereby reducing the overall proximal computation cost. It also introduces control variables that incorporate global gradient information into client updates, which helps mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FedCanon achieves sublinear convergence rates under general non-convex settings and linear convergence under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, without relying on bounded heterogeneity assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that FedCanon outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly under heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs), allow the attacker to create non-constrained adversarial examples without given clean samples, posing a severe threat to the safety of deep learning models. Recent works utilize diffusion models to generate UAEs. However, these UAEs often lack naturalness and imperceptibility due to simply optimizing in intermediate latent noises. In light of this, we propose SemDiff, a novel unrestricted adversarial attack that explores the semantic latent space of diffusion models for meaningful attributes, and devises a multi-attributes optimization approach to ensure attack success while maintaining the naturalness and imperceptibility of generated UAEs. We perform extensive experiments on four tasks on three high-resolution datasets, including CelebA-HQ, AFHQ and ImageNet. The results demonstrate that SemDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of attack success rate and imperceptibility. The generated UAEs are natural and exhibit semantically meaningful changes, in accord with the attributes' weights. In addition, SemDiff is found capable of evading different defenses, which further validates its effectiveness and threatening.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from pre-collected datasets, offering a practical solution for applications where online interactions are risky or costly. Model-based approaches are particularly advantageous for offline RL, owing to their data efficiency and generalizability. However, due to inherent model errors, model-based methods often artificially introduce conservatism guided by heuristic uncertainty estimation, which can be unreliable. In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a novel model-based offline RL algorithm that incorporates self-supervised feedback from value estimation to enhance model training. Specifically, the model is learned by additionally minimizing the inconsistency between the value learned directly from the offline data and the one estimated from the model. We perform comprehensive evaluations from multiple perspectives to show that VIPO can learn a highly accurate model efficiently and consistently outperform existing methods. It offers a general framework that can be readily integrated into existing model-based offline RL algorithms to systematically enhance model accuracy. As a result, VIPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in both D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is attracting attention as a machine-learning technique for edge computing. In time-series classification tasks, the number of features obtained using a reservoir depends on the length of the input series. Therefore, the features must be converted to a constant-length intermediate representation (IR), such that they can be processed by an output layer. Existing conversion methods involve computationally expensive matrix inversion that significantly increases the circuit size and requires processing power when implemented in hardware. In this article, we propose a simple but effective IR, namely, dot-product-based reservoir representation (DPRR), for RC based on the dot product of data features. Additionally, we propose a hardware-friendly delayed-feedback reservoir (DFR) consisting of a nonlinear element and delayed feedback loop with DPRR. The proposed DFR successfully classified multivariate time series data that has been considered particularly difficult to implement efficiently in hardware. In contrast to conventional DFR models that require analog circuits, the proposed model can be implemented in a fully digital manner suitable for high-level syntheses. A comparison with existing machine-learning methods via field-programmable gate array implementation using 12 multivariate time-series classification tasks confirmed the superior accuracy and small circuit size of the proposed method.

Abstract: Transfer learning from pre-trained encoders has become essential in modern machine learning, enabling efficient model adaptation across diverse tasks. However, this combination of pre-training and downstream adaptation creates an expanded attack surface, exposing models to sophisticated backdoor embeddings at both the encoder and dataset levels--an area often overlooked in prior research. Additionally, the limited computational resources typically available to users of pre-trained encoders constrain the effectiveness of generic backdoor defenses compared to end-to-end training from scratch. In this work, we investigate how to mitigate potential backdoor risks in resource-constrained transfer learning scenarios. Specifically, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of existing defense strategies, revealing that many follow a reactive workflow based on assumptions that do not scale to unknown threats, novel attack types, or different training paradigms. In response, we introduce a proactive mindset focused on identifying clean elements and propose the Trusted Core (T-Core) Bootstrapping framework, which emphasizes the importance of pinpointing trustworthy data and neurons to enhance model security. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of T-Core, specifically assessing 5 encoder poisoning attacks, 7 dataset poisoning attacks, and 14 baseline defenses across five benchmark datasets, addressing four scenarios of 3 potential backdoor threats.

Abstract: A domain (distribution) shift between training and test data often hinders the real-world performance of deep neural networks, necessitating unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to bridge this gap. Online source-free UDA has emerged as a solution for practical scenarios where access to source data is restricted and target data is received as a continuous stream. However, the open-world nature of many real-world applications additionally introduces category shifts meaning that the source and target label spaces may differ. Online source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing methods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship between pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled experiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into pseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap between the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved with perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables effective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a cross-entropy loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves superior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection. Lastly, our findings indicate that pseudo-label accuracy is in general more crucial than quantity, suggesting that prioritizing fewer but high-confidence pseudo-labels is beneficial. Overall, our study highlights the critical role of pseudo-labeling in (online) SF-UniDA and provides actionable insights to drive future advancements in the field.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning in infinite-horizon average-reward settings with linear MDPs. Previous work addresses this problem by approximating the average-reward setting by discounted setting and employing a value iteration-based algorithm that uses clipping to constrain the span of the value function for improved statistical efficiency. However, the clipping procedure requires computing the minimum of the value function over the entire state space, which is prohibitive since the state space in linear MDP setting can be large or even infinite. In this paper, we introduce a value iteration method with efficient clipping operation that only requires computing the minimum of value functions over the set of states visited by the algorithm. Our algorithm enjoys the same regret bound as the previous work while being computationally efficient, with computational complexity that is independent of the size of the state space.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) in graphs has garnered significant attention, particularly in employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with pretext tasks initially designed for other domains, such as contrastive learning and feature reconstruction. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods effectively reflect essential graph properties, precisely representation similarity with its neighbors. We observe that existing methods position opposite ends of a spectrum driven by the graph embedding smoothness, with each end corresponding to outperformance on specific downstream tasks. Decomposing the SSL objective into three terms via an information-theoretic framework with a neighbor representation variable reveals that this polarization stems from an imbalance among the terms, which existing methods may not effectively maintain. Further insights suggest that balancing between the extremes can lead to improved performance across a wider range of downstream tasks. A framework, BSG (Balancing Smoothness in Graph SSL), introduces novel loss functions designed to supplement the representation quality in graph-based SSL by balancing the derived three terms: neighbor loss, minimal loss, and divergence loss. We present a theoretical analysis of the effects of these loss functions, highlighting their significance from both the SSL and graph smoothness perspectives. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets across node classification and link prediction consistently demonstrate that BSG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/steve30572/BSG.

<title>Active Human Feedback Collection via Neural Contextual Dueling Bandits</title>

Abstract: Collecting human preference feedback is often expensive, leading recent works to develop principled algorithms to select them more efficiently. However, these works assume that the underlying reward function is linear, an assumption that does not hold in many real-life applications, such as online recommendation and LLM alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Neural-ADB, an algorithm based on the neural contextual dueling bandit framework that provides a principled and practical method for collecting human preference feedback when the underlying latent reward function is non-linear. We theoretically show that when preference feedback follows the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the worst sub-optimality gap of the policy learned by Neural-ADB decreases at a sub-linear rate as the preference dataset increases. Our experimental results on problem instances derived from synthetic preference datasets further validate the effectiveness of Neural-ADB.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple parties while preserving privacy. However, most FL systems assume clients hold only unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions often possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further constrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA, a novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized local model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to learn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data heterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that works effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose multimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ contrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure the independence between aligned features and context features within each modality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental results show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in multimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.

<title>Generative Deep Learning Framework for Inverse Design of Fuels</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12075</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model provides a flexible tool for systematically exploring vast chemical spaces, paving the way for discovering fuels with superior anti-knock properties. The demonstrated approach can be readily extended to incorporate additional fuel properties and synthesizability criteria to enhance applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.

<title>Neural Contextual Bandits Under Delayed Feedback Constraints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for neural contextual bandits (CBs) that addresses the challenge of delayed reward feedback, where the reward for a chosen action is revealed after a random, unknown delay. This scenario is common in applications such as online recommendation systems and clinical trials, where reward feedback is delayed because the outcomes or results of a user's actions (such as recommendations or treatment responses) take time to manifest and be measured. The proposed algorithm, called Delayed NeuralUCB, uses an upper confidence bound (UCB)-based exploration strategy. Under the assumption of independent and identically distributed sub-exponential reward delays, we derive an upper bound on the cumulative regret over a T-length horizon. We further consider a variant of the algorithm, called Delayed NeuralTS, that uses Thompson Sampling-based exploration. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets, such as MNIST and Mushroom, along with comparisons to benchmark approaches, demonstrate that the proposed algorithms effectively manage varying delays and are well-suited for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) faces two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability in the decision logic of multimodal fusion and modality imbalance caused by disparities in inter-modal information density. To address these issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the interpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the Multimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its univariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of cross-modal interactions. This structural design allows direct inspection of feature transformations without relying on external interpretation tools, thereby ensuring both high expressiveness and interpretability. Second, the proposed MCPareto enhances robustness by addressing modality imbalance and noise interference. Specifically, we introduce the Dimensionality Reduction and Denoising Modal Information Bottleneck (DRD-MIB) method, which jointly denoises and reduces feature dimensionality. This approach provides KAN with discriminative low-dimensional inputs to reduce the modeling complexity of KAN while preserving critical sentiment-related information. Furthermore, MCPareto dynamically balances gradient contributions across modalities using the purified features output by DRD-MIB, ensuring lossless transmission of auxiliary signals and effectively alleviating modality imbalance. This synergy of interpretability and robustness not only achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS v2 but also offers an intuitive visualization interface through KAN's interpretable architecture.

<title>Predictive Multiplicity in Survival Models: A Method for Quantifying Model Uncertainty in Predictive Maintenance Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12156</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, especially those involving prediction, models may yield near-optimal performance yet significantly disagree on individual-level outcomes. This phenomenon, known as predictive multiplicity, has been formally defined in binary, probabilistic, and multi-target classification, and undermines the reliability of predictive systems. However, its implications remain unexplored in the context of survival analysis, which involves estimating the time until a failure or similar event while properly handling censored data. We frame predictive multiplicity as a critical concern in survival-based models and introduce formal measures -- ambiguity, discrepancy, and obscurity -- to quantify it. This is particularly relevant for downstream tasks such as maintenance scheduling, where precise individual risk estimates are essential. Understanding and reporting predictive multiplicity helps build trust in models deployed in high-stakes environments. We apply our methodology to benchmark datasets from predictive maintenance, extending the notion of multiplicity to survival models. Our findings show that ambiguity steadily increases, reaching up to 40-45% of observations; discrepancy is lower but exhibits a similar trend; and obscurity remains mild and concentrated in a few models. These results demonstrate that multiple accurate survival models may yield conflicting estimations of failure risk and degradation progression for the same equipment. This highlights the need to explicitly measure and communicate predictive multiplicity to ensure reliable decision-making in process health management.

<title>Battery-aware Cyclic Scheduling in Energy-harvesting Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed learning, but its growing complexity has led to significant energy consumption, particularly from computations on the client side. This challenge is especially critical in energy-harvesting FL (EHFL) systems, where device availability fluctuates due to limited and time-varying energy resources. We propose FedBacys, a battery-aware FL framework that introduces cyclic client participation based on users' battery levels to cope with these issues. FedBacys enables clients to save energy and strategically perform local training just before their designated transmission time by clustering clients and scheduling their involvement sequentially. This design minimizes redundant computation, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability. Our experiments demonstrate that FedBacys outperforms existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency and performance consistency, exhibiting robustness even under non-i.i.d. training data distributions and with very infrequent battery charging. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of cyclic client participation in EHFL, incorporating both communication and computation costs into a unified, resource-aware scheduling strategy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) raised concerns over potential misuse, such as for spreading misinformation. In response two counter measures emerged: machine learning-based detectors that predict if text is synthetic, and LLM watermarking, which subtly marks generated text for identification and attribution. Meanwhile, humans are known to adjust language to their conversational partners both syntactically and lexically. By implication, it is possible that humans or unwatermarked LLMs could unintentionally mimic properties of LLM generated text, making counter measures unreliable. In this work we investigate the extent to which such conversational adaptation happens. We call the concept $\textit{mimicry}$ and demonstrate that both humans and LLMs end up mimicking, including the watermarking signal even in seemingly improbable settings. This challenges current academic assumptions and suggests that for long-term watermarking to be reliable, the likelihood of false positives needs to be significantly lower, while longer word sequences should be used for seeding watermarking mechanisms.

<title>SCENT: Robust Spatiotemporal Learning for Continuous Scientific Data via Scalable Conditioned Neural Fields</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal learning is challenging due to the intricate interplay between spatial and temporal dependencies, the high dimensionality of the data, and scalability constraints. These challenges are further amplified in scientific domains, where data is often irregularly distributed (e.g., missing values from sensor failures) and high-volume (e.g., high-fidelity simulations), posing additional computational and modeling difficulties. In this paper, we present SCENT, a novel framework for scalable and continuity-informed spatiotemporal representation learning. SCENT unifies interpolation, reconstruction, and forecasting within a single architecture. Built on a transformer-based encoder-processor-decoder backbone, SCENT introduces learnable queries to enhance generalization and a query-wise cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. To ensure scalability in both data size and model complexity, we incorporate a sparse attention mechanism, enabling flexible output representations and efficient evaluation at arbitrary resolutions. We validate SCENT through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple challenging tasks while achieving superior scalability.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary goal of this study is to explore the application of evaluation metrics to different clustering algorithms using the data provided from the Canadian Longitudinal Study (CLSA), focusing on cognitive features. The objective of our work is to discover potential clinically relevant clusters that contribute to the development of dementia over time-based on cognitive changes. Method: The CLSA dataset includes 18,891 participants with data available at both baseline and follow-up assessments, to which clustering algorithms were applied. The clustering methodologies employed in this analysis are K-means (KM) clustering, Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM). We use multiple evaluation metrics to assess our analysis. For internal evaluation metrics, we use: Average silhouette Width, Within and Between the sum of square Ratio (WB.Ratio), Entropy, Calinski-Harabasz Index (CH Index), and Separation Index. For clustering comparison metrics, we used: Homogeneity, Completeness, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Rand Index (RI), and Variation Information. Results: Using evaluation metrics to compare the results of the three clustering techniques, K-means and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) produced similar results. In contrast, there are significant differences between K-means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. Our study highlights the importance of the two internal evaluation metrics: entropy and separation index. In between clustering comparison metrics, the Adjusted Rand Index is a key tool. Conclusion: The study results have the potential to contribute to understanding dementia. Researchers can also benefit by applying the suggested evaluation metrics to other areas of healthcare research. Overall, our study improves the understanding of using clustering techniques and evaluation metrics to reveal complex patterns in medical data.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of abdominal adipose tissue, including subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), along with liver segmentation, is essential for understanding body composition and associated health risks such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study proposes Attention GhostUNet++, a novel deep learning model incorporating Channel, Spatial, and Depth Attention mechanisms into the Ghost UNet++ bottleneck for automated, precise segmentation. Evaluated on the AATTCT-IDS and LiTS datasets, the model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.9430 for VAT, 0.9639 for SAT, and 0.9652 for liver segmentation, surpassing baseline models. Despite minor limitations in boundary detail segmentation, the proposed model significantly enhances feature refinement, contextual understanding, and computational efficiency, offering a robust solution for body composition analysis.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of tool-tissue interactions in robotic surgery requires precise tracking of deformable tissues and integration of surgical domain knowledge. Traditional methods rely on labor-intensive annotations or rigid assumptions, limiting flexibility. We propose a framework combining sparse keypoint tracking and probabilistic modeling that propagates expert-annotated landmarks across endoscopic frames, even with large tissue deformations. Clustered tissue keypoints enable dynamic local transformation construction via PCA, and tool poses, tracked similarly, are expressed relative to these frames. Embedding these into a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) integrates data-driven observations with labeled clinical expertise, effectively predicting relative tool-tissue poses and enhancing visual understanding of robotic surgical motions directly from video data.

Abstract: Timing analysis is an essential and demanding verification method for Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit design and optimization. In addition, it also serves as the cornerstone of the final sign-off, determining whether the chip is ready to be sent to the semiconductor foundry for fabrication. Recently, as the technology advance relentlessly, smaller metal pitches and the increasing number of devices have led to greater challenges and longer turn-around-time for experienced human designers to debug timing issues from the Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing reports. As a result, an efficient and intelligent methodology is highly necessary and essential for debugging timing issues and reduce the turnaround times. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise across various tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, incorporating reasoning and actions. In this work, we propose a timing analysis agent, that is empowered by multi-LLMs task solving, and incorporates a novel hierarchical planning and solving flow to automate the analysis of timing reports from commercial tool. In addition, we build a Timing Debug Relation Graph (TDRG) that connects the reports with the relationships of debug traces from experienced timing engineers. The timing analysis agent employs the novel Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, that includes agent and coding to retrieve data accurately, on the developed TDRG. In our studies, the proposed timing analysis agent achieves an average 98% pass-rate on a single-report benchmark and a 90% pass-rate for multi-report benchmark from industrial designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly used in educational settings, from detecting at-risk students to predicting student performance, algorithmic bias and its potential impacts on students raise critical concerns about algorithmic fairness. Although group fairness is widely explored in education, works on individual fairness in a causal context are understudied, especially on counterfactual fairness. This paper explores the notion of counterfactual fairness for educational data by conducting counterfactual fairness analysis of machine learning models on benchmark educational datasets. We demonstrate that counterfactual fairness provides meaningful insight into the causality of sensitive attributes and causal-based individual fairness in education.

arXiv:2504.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In various networks and mobile applications, users are highly susceptible to attribute inference attacks, with particularly prevalent occurrences in recommender systems. Attackers exploit partially exposed user profiles in recommendation models, such as user embeddings, to infer private attributes of target users, such as gender and political views. The goal of defenders is to mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks while maintaining recommendation performance. Most existing defense methods, such as differential privacy and attribute unlearning, focus on post-training settings, which limits their capability of utilizing training data to preserve recommendation performance. Although adversarial training extends defenses to in-training settings, it often struggles with convergence due to unstable training processes. In this paper, we propose RAID, an in-training defense method against attribute inference attacks in recommender systems. In addition to the recommendation objective, we define a defensive objective to ensure that the distribution of protected attributes becomes independent of class labels, making users indistinguishable from attribute inference attacks. Specifically, this defensive objective aims to solve a constrained Wasserstein barycenter problem to identify the centroid distribution that makes the attribute indistinguishable while complying with recommendation performance constraints. To optimize our proposed objective, we use optimal transport to align users with the centroid distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to evaluate RAID. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of RAID and demonstrate its significant superiority over existing methods in multiple aspects.

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurately classifying tissue margins during cancer surgeries is crucial for ensuring complete tumor removal. Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment, generates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical decision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts presents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a foundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this limitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We propose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is an adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio association, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach based on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed model against other models and pretraining methods. Results: Our proposed model significantly improves the classification performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an AUROC of $82.4\% \pm 0.8$. The results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed pretraining method and selected backbone over the self-supervised and semi-supervised baselines and alternative models. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that foundation models, adapted and pretrained using our novel approach, can effectively classify REIMS data even with limited labeled examples. This highlights the viability of foundation models for enhancing real-time surgical margin assessment, particularly in data-scarce clinical environments.

Abstract: We present a refined version of the Anomaly Awareness framework for enhancing unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach introduces minimal supervision into Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) through a two-stage training strategy: the model is first trained in an unsupervised manner on background data, and then fine-tuned using a small sample of labeled anomalies to encourage larger reconstruction errors for anomalous samples.
  We validate the method across diverse domains, including the MNIST dataset with synthetic anomalies, network intrusion data from the CICIDS benchmark, collider physics data from the LHCO2020 dataset, and simulated events from the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The latter provides a realistic example of subtle kinematic deviations in Higgs boson production. In all cases, the model demonstrates improved sensitivity to unseen anomalies, achieving better separation between normal and anomalous samples. These results indicate that even limited anomaly information, when incorporated through targeted fine-tuning, can substantially improve the generalization and performance of unsupervised models for anomaly detection.

Abstract: There is growing interest in hypothesis generation with large language models (LLMs). However, fundamental questions remain: what makes a good hypothesis, and how can we systematically evaluate methods for hypothesis generation? To address this, we introduce HypoBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs and hypothesis generation methods across multiple aspects, including practical utility, generalizability, and hypothesis discovery rate. HypoBench includes 7 real-world tasks and 5 synthetic tasks with 194 distinct datasets. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs combined with six existing hypothesis-generation methods. Overall, our results suggest that existing methods are capable of discovering valid and novel patterns in the data. However, the results from synthetic datasets indicate that there is still significant room for improvement, as current hypothesis generation methods do not fully uncover all relevant or meaningful patterns. Specifically, in synthetic settings, as task difficulty increases, performance significantly drops, with best models and methods only recovering 38.8% of the ground-truth hypotheses. These findings highlight challenges in hypothesis generation and demonstrate that HypoBench serves as a valuable resource for improving AI systems designed to assist scientific discovery.

Abstract: Bayesian inference with computationally expensive likelihood evaluations remains a significant challenge in many scientific domains. We propose normalizing flow regression (NFR), a novel offline inference method for approximating posterior distributions. Unlike traditional surrogate approaches that require additional sampling or inference steps, NFR directly yields a tractable posterior approximation through regression on existing log-density evaluations. We introduce training techniques specifically for flow regression, such as tailored priors and likelihood functions, to achieve robust posterior and model evidence estimation. We demonstrate NFR's effectiveness on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications from neuroscience and biology, showing superior or comparable performance to existing methods. NFR represents a promising approach for Bayesian inference when standard methods are computationally prohibitive or existing model evaluations can be recycled.

<title>Sub-optimality of the Separation Principle for Quadratic Control from Bilinear Observations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11555</link>

Abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system from bilinear observations with minimal quadratic cost. Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.

<title>Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Service Patrolling for Real-time Incident Management during High-impact Events</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11570</link>

Abstract: This paper presents the Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Patrolling Algorithm (TAMPA), designed to improve real-time incident management during major events like sports tournaments and concerts. Such events significantly stress transportation networks, requiring efficient and adaptive patrol solutions. TAMPA integrates predictive traffic modeling and real-time complaint estimation, dynamically optimizing patrol deployment. Using dynamic programming, the algorithm continuously adjusts patrol strategies within short planning windows, effectively balancing immediate response and efficient routing. Leveraging the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, TAMPA detects significant shifts in complaint patterns, triggering proactive adjustments in patrol routes. Theoretical analyses ensure performance remains closely aligned with optimal solutions. Simulation results from an urban traffic network demonstrate TAMPA's superior performance, showing improvements of approximately 87.5\% over stationary methods and 114.2\% over random strategies. Future work includes enhancing adaptability and incorporating digital twin technology for improved predictive accuracy, particularly relevant for events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup at MetLife Stadium.

<title>MULTI-LF: A Unified Continuous Learning Framework for Real-Time DDoS Detection in Multi-Environment Networks</title>

Abstract: Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Multi-Environment (M-En) networks presents significant challenges due to diverse malicious traffic patterns and the evolving nature of cyber threats. Existing AI-based detection systems struggle to adapt to new attack strategies and lack real-time attack detection capabilities with high accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes an online, continuous learning methodology for DDoS detection in M-En networks, enabling continuous model updates and real-time adaptation to emerging threats, including zero-day attacks. First, we develop a unique M-En network dataset by setting up a realistic, real-time simulation using the NS-3 tool, incorporating both victim and bot devices. DDoS attacks with varying packet sizes are simulated using the DDoSim application across IoT and traditional IP-based environments under M-En network criteria. Our approach employs a multi-level framework (MULTI-LF) featuring two machine learning models: a lightweight Model 1 (M1) trained on a selective, critical packet dataset for fast and efficient initial detection, and a more complex, highly accurate Model 2 (M2) trained on extensive data. When M1 exhibits low confidence in its predictions, the decision is escalated to M2 for verification and potential fine-tuning of M1 using insights from M2. If both models demonstrate low confidence, the system flags the incident for human intervention, facilitating model updates with human-verified categories to enhance adaptability to unseen attack patterns. We validate the MULTI-LF through real-world simulations, demonstrating superior classification accuracy of 0.999 and low prediction latency of 0.866 seconds compared to established baselines. Furthermore, we evaluate performance in terms of memory usage (3.632 MB) and CPU utilization (10.05%) in real-time scenarios.

<title>Towards Interpretable Deep Generative Models via Causal Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) rely on machine learning techniques such as deep learning and generative modeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance across wide-ranging domains. These methods' surprising performance is due in part to their ability to learn implicit "representations'' of complex, multi-modal data. Unfortunately, deep neural networks are notoriously black boxes that obscure these representations, making them difficult to interpret or analyze. To resolve these difficulties, one approach is to build new interpretable neural network models from the ground up. This is the goal of the emerging field of causal representation learning (CRL) that uses causality as a vector for building flexible, interpretable, and transferable generative AI. CRL can be seen as a culmination of three intrinsically statistical problems: (i) latent variable models such as factor analysis; (ii) causal graphical models with latent variables; and (iii) nonparametric statistics and deep learning. This paper reviews recent progress in CRL from a statistical perspective, focusing on connections to classical models and statistical and causal identifiablity results. This review also highlights key application areas, implementation strategies, and open statistical questions in CRL.

<title>Generalized probabilistic canonical correlation analysis for multi-modal data integration with full or partial observations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11610</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The integration and analysis of multi-modal data are increasingly essential across various domains including bioinformatics. As the volume and complexity of such data grow, there is a pressing need for computational models that not only integrate diverse modalities but also leverage their complementary information to improve clustering accuracy and insights, especially when dealing with partial observations with missing data. Results: We propose Generalized Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (GPCCA), an unsupervised method for the integration and joint dimensionality reduction of multi-modal data. GPCCA addresses key challenges in multi-modal data analysis by handling missing values within the model, enabling the integration of more than two modalities, and identifying informative features while accounting for correlations within individual modalities. The model demonstrates robustness to various missing data patterns and provides low-dimensional embeddings that facilitate downstream clustering and analysis. In a range of simulation settings, GPCCA outperforms existing methods in capturing essential patterns across modalities. Additionally, we demonstrate its applicability to multi-omics data from TCGA cancer datasets and a multi-view image dataset. Conclusion: GPCCA offers a useful framework for multi-modal data integration, effectively handling missing data and providing informative low-dimensional embeddings. Its performance across cancer genomics and multi-view image data highlights its robustness and potential for broad application. To make the method accessible to the wider research community, we have released an R package, GPCCA, which is available at https://github.com/Kaversoniano/GPCCA.

<title>Robust Markov stability for community detection at a scale learned based on the structure</title>

Abstract: Community detection, the unsupervised task of clustering nodes of a graph, finds applications across various fields. The common approaches for community detection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into communities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale approaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a suitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust partitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability function. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by the user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at a suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our proposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained machine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a scale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale selection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted and embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark networks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the similarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark network. Combining our scale selection algorithm with the PyGenStability algorithm results in PyGenStabilityOne (PO): a hyperparameter-free multi-scale community detection algorithm that returns one robust partition at a suitable scale without the need for any assumptions, input, or tweaking from the user. We compare the performance of PO against 29 algorithms and show that it outperforms 25 other algorithms by statistically meaningful margins. Our results facilitate choosing between community detection algorithms, among which PO stands out as the accurate, robust, and hyperparameter-free method.

<title>Data driven approach towards more efficient Newton-Raphson power flow calculation for distribution grids</title>

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are fundamental to power system analysis to ensure stable and reliable grid operation. The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is commonly used for PF analysis due to its rapid convergence when initialized properly. However, as power grids operate closer to their capacity limits, ill-conditioned cases and convergence issues pose significant challenges. This work, therefore, addresses these challenges by proposing strategies to improve NR initialization, hence minimizing iterations and avoiding divergence. We explore three approaches: (i) an analytical method that estimates the basin of attraction using mathematical bounds on voltages, (ii) Two data-driven models leveraging supervised learning or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict optimal initial guesses, and (iii) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that incrementally adjusts voltages to accelerate convergence. These methods are tested on benchmark systems. This research is particularly relevant for modern power systems, where high penetration of renewables and decentralized generation require robust and scalable PF solutions. In experiments, all three proposed methods demonstrate a strong ability to provide an initial guess for Newton-Raphson method to converge with fewer steps. The findings provide a pathway for more efficient real-time grid operations, which, in turn, support the transition toward smarter and more resilient electricity networks.

Abstract: The literature is abundant with methodologies focusing on using transformer architectures due to their prominence in wireless signal processing and their capability to capture long-range dependencies via attention mechanisms. In particular, depthwise separable convolutions enhance parameter efficiency for the process of high-dimensional data characteristics of MIMO systems. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised deep learning framework that integrates depthwise separable convolutions and transformers to generate beamforming weights under imperfect channel state information (CSI) for a multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system in dense urban environments. The primary goal is to enhance throughput by maximizing sum-rate while ensuring reliable communication. Spectral efficiency and block error rate (BLER) are considered as performance metrics. Experiments are carried out under various conditions to compare the performance of the proposed NNBF framework against baseline methods zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over the baseline techniques.

<title>Steering Prosocial AI Agents: Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications.

Abstract: This study explores the dynamic landscape of Technical Debt (TD) topics in software engineering by examining its evolution across time, programming languages, and repositories. Despite the extensive research on identifying and quantifying TD, there remains a significant gap in understanding the diversity of TD topics and their temporal development. To address this, we have conducted an explorative analysis of TD data extracted from GitHub issues spanning from 2015 to September 2023. We employed BERTopic for sophisticated topic modelling. This study categorises the TD topics and tracks their progression over time. Furthermore, we have incorporated sentiment analysis for each identified topic, providing a deeper insight into the perceptions and attitudes associated with these topics. This offers a more nuanced understanding of the trends and shifts in TD topics through time, programming language, and repository.

<title>Climbing the Ladder of Reasoning: What LLMs Can-and Still Can't-Solve after SFT?</title>

Abstract: Recent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have significantly improved language models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, even when models are trained at a small scale. However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.

<title>GrabS: Generative Embodied Agent for 3D Object Segmentation without Scene Supervision</title>

Abstract: We study the hard problem of 3D object segmentation in complex point clouds without requiring human labels of 3D scenes for supervision. By relying on the similarity of pretrained 2D features or external signals such as motion to group 3D points as objects, existing unsupervised methods are usually limited to identifying simple objects like cars or their segmented objects are often inferior due to the lack of objectness in pretrained features. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage pipeline called GrabS. The core concept of our method is to learn generative and discriminative object-centric priors as a foundation from object datasets in the first stage, and then design an embodied agent to learn to discover multiple objects by querying against the pretrained generative priors in the second stage. We extensively evaluate our method on two real-world datasets and a newly created synthetic dataset, demonstrating remarkable segmentation performance, clearly surpassing all existing unsupervised methods.

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as a critical consideration in the landscape of machine learning algorithms, particularly as AI continues to transform decision-making across societal domains. To ensure that these algorithms are free from bias and do not discriminate against individuals based on sensitive attributes such as gender and race, the field of algorithmic bias has introduced various fairness concepts, along with methodologies to achieve these notions in different contexts. Despite the rapid advancement, not all sectors have embraced these fairness principles to the same extent. One specific sector that merits attention in this regard is insurance. Within the realm of insurance pricing, fairness is defined through a distinct and specialized framework. Consequently, achieving fairness according to established notions does not automatically ensure fair pricing in insurance. In particular, regulators are increasingly emphasizing transparency in pricing algorithms and imposing constraints on insurance companies on the collection and utilization of sensitive consumer attributes. These factors present additional challenges in the implementation of fairness in pricing algorithms. To address these complexities and comply with regulatory demands, we propose an efficient method for constructing fair models that are tailored to the insurance domain, using only privatized sensitive attributes. Notably, our approach ensures statistical guarantees, does not require direct access to sensitive attributes, and adapts to varying transparency requirements, addressing regulatory demands while ensuring fairness in insurance pricing.

<title>Bridging the Semantic Gaps: Improving Medical VQA Consistency with LLM-Augmented Question Sets</title>

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MVQA) systems can interpret medical images in response to natural language queries. However, linguistic variability in question phrasing often undermines the consistency of these systems. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantically Equivalent Question Augmentation (SEQA) framework, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse yet semantically equivalent rephrasings of questions. Specifically, this approach enriches linguistic diversity while preserving semantic meaning. We further introduce an evaluation metric, Total Agreement Rate with Semantically Equivalent Input and Correct Answer (TAR-SC), which assesses a model's capability to generate consistent and correct responses to semantically equivalent linguistic variations. In addition, we also propose three other diversity metrics - average number of QA items per image (ANQI), average number of questions per image with the same answer (ANQA), and average number of open-ended questions per image with the same semantics (ANQS). Using the SEQA framework, we augmented the benchmarked MVQA public datasets of SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PathVQA. As a result, all three datasets achieved significant improvements by incorporating more semantically equivalent questions: ANQI increased by an average of 86.1, ANQA by 85.1, and ANQS by 46. Subsequent experiments evaluate three MVQA models (M2I2, MUMC, and BiomedGPT) under both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings on the enhanced datasets. Experimental results in MVQA datasets show that fine-tuned models achieve an average accuracy improvement of 19.35%, while our proposed TAR-SC metric shows an average improvement of 11. 61%, indicating a substantial enhancement in model consistency.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in hyperspectral images (HSI), aiming to detect unknown targets from backgrounds, is challenging for earth surface monitoring. However, current studies are hindered by steep computational costs due to the high-dimensional property of HSI and dense sampling-based training paradigm, constraining their rapid deployment. Our key observation is that, during training, not all samples within the same homogeneous area are indispensable, whereas ingenious sampling can provide a powerful substitute for reducing costs. Motivated by this, we propose an Asymmetrical Consensus State Space Model (ACMamba) to significantly reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical anomaly detection paradigm that utilizes region-level instances as an efficient alternative to dense pixel-level samples. In this paradigm, a low-cost Mamba-based module is introduced to discover global contextual attributes of regions that are essential for HSI reconstruction. Additionally, we develop a consensus learning strategy from the optimization perspective to simultaneously facilitate background reconstruction and anomaly compression, further alleviating the negative impact of anomaly reconstruction. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify the superiority of ACMamba, demonstrating a faster speed and stronger performance over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The ability to predict drug overdose risk from a patient's medical records is crucial for timely intervention and prevention. Traditional machine learning models have shown promise in analyzing longitudinal medical records for this task. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer an opportunity to enhance prediction performance by leveraging their ability to process long textual data and their inherent prior knowledge across diverse tasks. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of Open AI's GPT-4o LLM in predicting drug overdose events using patients' longitudinal insurance claims records. We evaluate its performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, comparing them to strong traditional machine learning methods as baselines. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform traditional models in certain settings but can also predict overdose risk in a zero-shot setting without task-specific training. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support, particularly for drug overdose risk prediction.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs), which simultaneously integrate message-passing and self-attention mechanisms, have achieved promising empirical results in some graph prediction tasks. Although these approaches show the potential of Transformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues concerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption severely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as brain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the development of graph representation learning methods with lower computational and storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using Spiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ reconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and injects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global information in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization effectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery (distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector quantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved competitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.

Abstract: To what extent do LLMs use their capabilities towards their given goal? We take this as a measure of their goal-directedness. We evaluate goal-directedness on tasks that require information gathering, cognitive effort, and plan execution, where we use subtasks to infer each model's relevant capabilities. Our evaluations of LLMs from Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic show that goal-directedness is relatively consistent across tasks, differs from task performance, and is only moderately sensitive to motivational prompts. Notably, most models are not fully goal-directed. We hope our goal-directedness evaluations will enable better monitoring of LLM progress, and enable more deliberate design choices of agentic properties in LLMs.

Abstract: An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

Abstract: As an open research topic in the field of deep learning, learning with noisy labels has attracted much attention and grown rapidly over the past ten years. Learning with label noise is crucial for driver distraction behavior recognition, as real-world video data often contains mislabeled samples, impacting model reliability and performance. However, label noise learning is barely explored in the driver activity recognition field. In this paper, we propose the first label noise learning approach for the driver activity recognition task. Based on the cluster assumption, we initially enable the model to learn clustering-friendly low-dimensional representations from given videos and assign the resultant embeddings into clusters. We subsequently perform co-refinement within each cluster to smooth the classifier outputs. Furthermore, we propose a flexible sample selection strategy that combines two selection criteria without relying on any hyperparameters to filter clean samples from the training dataset. We also incorporate a self-adaptive parameter into the sample selection process to enforce balancing across classes. A comprehensive variety of experiments on the public Drive&amp;Act dataset for all granularity levels demonstrates the superior performance of our method in comparison with other label-denoising methods derived from the image classification field.

Abstract: We present a general system identification procedure capable of estimating of a broad spectrum of state-space dynamical models, including linear time-invariant (LTI), linear parameter-varying} (LPV), and nonlinear (NL) dynamics, along with rather general classes of noise models. Similar to the LTI case, we show that for this general class of model structures, including the NL case, the model dynamics can be separated into a deterministic process and a stochastic noise part, allowing to seamlessly tune the complexity of the combined model both in terms of nonlinearity and noise modeling. We parameterize the involved nonlinear functional relations by means of artificial neural-networks (ANNs), although alternative parametric nonlinear mappings can also be used. To estimate the resulting model structures, we optimize a prediction-error-based criterion using an efficient combination of a constrained quasi-Newton approach and automatic differentiation, achieving training times in the order of seconds compared to existing state-of-the-art ANN methods which may require hours for models of similar complexity. We formally establish the consistency guarantees for the proposed approach and demonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency on several benchmark LTI, LPV, and NL system identification problems.

Abstract: Data-driven flow control has significant potential for industry, energy systems, and climate science. In this work, we study the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reducing convective heat transfer in the 2D Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC) system under increasing turbulence. We investigate the generalizability of control across varying initial conditions and turbulence levels and introduce a reward shaping technique to accelerate the training. RL agents trained via single-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are compared to linear proportional derivative (PD) controllers from classical control theory. The RL agents reduced convection, measured by the Nusselt Number, by up to 33% in moderately turbulent systems and 10% in highly turbulent settings, clearly outperforming PD control in all settings. The agents showed strong generalization performance across different initial conditions and to a significant extent, generalized to higher degrees of turbulence. The reward shaping improved sample efficiency and consistently stabilized the Nusselt Number to higher turbulence levels.

Abstract: Voice conversion is a task of synthesizing an utterance with target speaker's voice while maintaining linguistic information of the source utterance. While a speaker can produce varying utterances from a single script with different intonations, conventional voice conversion models were limited to producing only one result per source input. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach for voice conversion with diverse intonations using conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Experiments have shown that the speaker's style feature can be mapped into a latent space with Gaussian distribution. We have also been able to convert voices with more diverse intonation by making the posterior of the latent space more complex with inverse autoregressive flow (IAF). As a result, the converted voice not only has a diversity of intonations, but also has better sound quality than the model without CVAE.

Abstract: Radar-based HAR has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional monitoring approaches, such as wearable devices and camera-based systems, due to its unique privacy preservation and robustness advantages. However, existing solutions based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, although effective, are computationally demanding during deployment. This limits their applicability in scenarios with constrained resources or those requiring multiple sensors. Advanced architectures, such as ViT and SSM architectures, offer improved modeling capabilities and have made efforts toward lightweight designs. However, their computational complexity remains relatively high. To leverage the strengths of transformer architectures while simultaneously enhancing accuracy and reducing computational complexity, this paper introduces RadMamba, a parameter-efficient, radar micro-Doppler-oriented Mamba SSM specifically tailored for radar-based HAR. Across three diverse datasets, RadMamba matches the top-performing previous model's 99.8% classification accuracy on Dataset DIAT with only 1/400 of its parameters and equals the leading models' 92.0% accuracy on Dataset CI4R with merely 1/10 of their parameters. In scenarios with continuous sequences of actions evaluated on Dataset UoG2020, RadMamba surpasses other models with significantly higher parameter counts by at least 3%, achieving this with only 6.7k parameters.

Abstract: Computer vision models have seen increased usage in sports, and reinforcement learning (RL) is famous for beating humans in strategic games such as Chess and Go. In this paper, we are interested in building upon these advances and examining the game of classic 8-ball pool. We introduce pix2pockets, a foundation for an RL-assisted pool coach. Given a single image of a pool table, we first aim to detect the table and the balls and then propose the optimal shot suggestion. For the first task, we build a dataset with 195 diverse images where we manually annotate all balls and table dots, leading to 5748 object segmentation masks. For the second task, we build a standardized RL environment that allows easy development and benchmarking of any RL algorithm. Our object detection model yields an AP50 of 91.2 while our ball location pipeline obtains an error of only 0.4 cm. Furthermore, we compare standard RL algorithms to set a baseline for the shot suggestion task and we show that all of them fail to pocket all balls without making a foul move. We also present a simple baseline that achieves a per-shot success rate of 94.7% and clears a full game in a single turn 30% of the time.

<title>On the calibration of Just-in-time Defect Prediction</title>

Abstract: Just in time defect prediction (JIT DP) leverages ML to identify defect-prone code commits, enabling quality assurance (QA) teams to allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on commits that are most likely to contain defects. Although JIT DP techniques have introduced improvements in terms of predictive accuracy, they are still susceptible to misclassification errors such as false positives and negatives. This can lead to wasted resources or undetected defects, a particularly critical concern when QA resources are limited. To mitigate these challenges and preserve the practical utility of JIT DP tools, it becomes essential to estimate the reliability of the predictions, i.e., computing confidence scores. Such scores can help practitioners determine the trustworthiness of predictions and thus prioritize them efficiently. A simple approach to computing confidence scores is to extract, alongside each prediction, the corresponding prediction probabilities and use them as indicators of confidence. However, for these probabilities to reliably serve as confidence scores, the predictive model must be well-calibrated. This means that the prediction probabilities must accurately represent the true likelihood of each prediction being correct. Miscalibration, common in modern ML models, distorts probability scores such that they do not align with the actual correctness probability. In this study, we evaluate the calibration of three JIT DP techniques to determine whether and to what extent they exhibit poor calibration. Furthermore, we assess whether post-calibration methods can improve the calibration of existing JIT defect prediction models. Our results reveal that all evaluated JIT DP models exhibit some level of miscalibration, with ECE ranging from 2-35%. Furthermore, post-calibration methods do not consistently improve the calibration.

<title>Optimizing Compound Retrieval Systems</title>

Abstract: Modern retrieval systems do not rely on a single ranking model to construct their rankings. Instead, they generally take a cascading approach where a sequence of ranking models are applied in multiple re-ranking stages. Thereby, they balance the quality of the top-K ranking with computational costs by limiting the number of documents each model re-ranks. However, the cascading approach is not the only way models can interact to form a retrieval system.
  We propose the concept of compound retrieval systems as a broader class of retrieval systems that apply multiple prediction models. This encapsulates cascading models but also allows other types of interactions than top-K re-ranking. In particular, we enable interactions with large language models (LLMs) which can provide relative relevance comparisons. We focus on the optimization of compound retrieval system design which uniquely involves learning where to apply the component models and how to aggregate their predictions into a final ranking. This work shows how our compound approach can combine the classic BM25 retrieval model with state-of-the-art (pairwise) LLM relevance predictions, while optimizing a given ranking metric and efficiency target. Our experimental results show optimized compound retrieval systems provide better trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency than cascading approaches, even when applied in a self-supervised manner.
  With the introduction of compound retrieval systems, we hope to inspire the information retrieval field to more out-of-the-box thinking on how prediction models can interact to form rankings.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech. However, their immense capacity often leads to overfitting, especially when training data is limited or noisy. We propose AttentionDrop, a unified family of stochastic regularization techniques that operate directly on the self-attention distributions. We introduces three variants: 1. Hard Attention Masking: randomly zeroes out top-k attention logits per query to encourage diverse context utilization. 2. Blurred Attention Smoothing: applies a dynamic Gaussian convolution over attention logits to diffuse overly peaked distributions. 3. Consistency-Regularized AttentionDrop: enforces output stability under multiple independent AttentionDrop perturbations via a KL-based consistency loss.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), these models still suffer from generating hallucinatory responses that do not align with the visual input provided. To mitigate such hallucinations, we introduce Efficient Contrastive Decoding (ECD), a simple method that leverages probabilistic hallucination detection to shift the output distribution towards contextually accurate answers at inference time. By contrasting token probabilities and hallucination scores, ECD subtracts hallucinated concepts from the original distribution, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method can be applied to any open-source LVLM and does not require additional LVLM training. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and across different LVLMs. Our experiments show that ECD effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with respect to performance on LVLM benchmarks and computation time.

Abstract: Semantic 3D city models are worldwide easy-accessible, providing accurate, object-oriented, and semantic-rich 3D priors. To date, their potential to mitigate the noise impact on radar object detection remains under-explored. In this paper, we first introduce a unique dataset, RadarCity, comprising 54K synchronized radar-image pairs and semantic 3D city models. Moreover, we propose a novel neural network, RADLER, leveraging the effectiveness of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) and semantic 3D city models to enhance radar object detection of pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. Specifically, we first obtain the robust radar features via a SSL network in the radar-image pretext task. We then use a simple yet effective feature fusion strategy to incorporate semantic-depth features from semantic 3D city models. Having prior 3D information as guidance, RADLER obtains more fine-grained details to enhance radar object detection. We extensively evaluate RADLER on the collected RadarCity dataset and demonstrate average improvements of 5.46% in mean avarage precision (mAP) and 3.51% in mean avarage recall (mAR) over previous radar object detection methods. We believe this work will foster further research on semantic-guided and map-supported radar object detection. Our project page is publicly available athttps://gpp-communication.github.io/RADLER .

<title>Approximation Bounds for Transformer Networks with Application to Regression</title>

Abstract: We explore the approximation capabilities of Transformer networks for H\"older and Sobolev functions, and apply these results to address nonparametric regression estimation with dependent observations. First, we establish novel upper bounds for standard Transformer networks approximating sequence-to-sequence mappings whose component functions are H\"older continuous with smoothness index $\gamma \in (0,1]$. To achieve an approximation error $\varepsilon$ under the $L^p$-norm for $p \in [1, \infty]$, it suffices to use a fixed-depth Transformer network whose total number of parameters scales as $\varepsilon^{-d_x n / \gamma}$. This result not only extends existing findings to include the case $p = \infty$, but also matches the best known upper bounds on number of parameters previously obtained for fixed-depth FNNs and RNNs. Similar bounds are also derived for Sobolev functions. Second, we derive explicit convergence rates for the nonparametric regression problem under various $\beta$-mixing data assumptions, which allow the dependence between observations to weaken over time. Our bounds on the sample complexity impose no constraints on weight magnitudes. Lastly, we propose a novel proof strategy to establish approximation bounds, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. We show that if the self-attention layer in a Transformer can perform column averaging, the network can approximate sequence-to-sequence H\"older functions, offering new insights into the interpretability of self-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce an approach for detecting and tracking detailed 3D poses of multiple people from a single monocular camera stream. Our system maintains temporally coherent predictions in crowded scenes filled with difficult poses and occlusions. Our model performs both strong per-frame detection and a learned pose update to track people from frame to frame. Rather than match detections across time, poses are updated directly from a new input image, which enables online tracking through occlusion. We train on numerous image and video datasets leveraging pseudo-labeled annotations to produce a model that matches state-of-the-art systems in 3D pose estimation accuracy while being faster and more accurate in tracking multiple people through time.

Abstract: It is sometimes assumed that Large Language Models (LLMs) know language, or for example that they know that Paris is the capital of France. But what -- if anything -- do LLMs actually know? In this paper, I argue that LLMs can acquire tacit knowledge as defined by Martin Davies (1990). Whereas Davies himself denies that neural networks can acquire tacit knowledge, I demonstrate that certain architectural features of LLMs satisfy the constraints of semantic description, syntactic structure, and causal systematicity. Thus, tacit knowledge may serve as a conceptual framework for describing, explaining, and intervening on LLMs and their behavior.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an important tool for distribution-free predictive uncertainty quantification. Yet, a major challenge is to balance computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly for multiple predictions. We propose Leave-One-Out Stable Conformal Prediction (LOO-StabCP), a novel method to speed up full conformal using algorithmic stability without sample splitting. By leveraging leave-one-out stability, our method is much faster in handling a large number of prediction requests compared to existing method RO-StabCP based on replace-one stability. We derived stability bounds for several popular machine learning tools: regularized loss minimization (RLM) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), as well as kernel method, neural networks and bagging. Our method is theoretically justified and demonstrates superior numerical performance on synthetic and real-world data. We applied our method to a screening problem, where its effective exploitation of training data led to improved test power compared to state-of-the-art method based on split conformal.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a promising machine learning paradigm for bringing artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to the network edge. Running DFL on top of edge networks, however, faces severe performance challenges due to the extensive parameter exchanges between agents. Most existing solutions for these challenges were based on simplistic communication models, which cannot capture the case of learning over a multi-hop bandwidth-limited network. In this work, we address this problem by jointly designing the communication scheme for the overlay network formed by the agents and the mixing matrix that controls the communication demands between the agents. By carefully analyzing the properties of our problem, we cast each design problem into a tractable optimization and develop an efficient algorithm with guaranteed performance. Our evaluations based on real topology and data show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the total training time by over $80\%$ compared to the baseline without sacrificing accuracy, while significantly improving the computational efficiency over the state of the art.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially providing advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically compares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against state-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance metrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy, highlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced diagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven diagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and high-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This comparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the selection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.

Abstract: Over the past years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated how AI can solve many perception and generation tasks, such as image classification and text writing, yet reasoning remains a challenge. This paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning, visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models, leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5 Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the accuracy to 85.2%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing reasoning models and the need for robust multimodal benchmarks like FLIP. The full codebase and dataset will be available at https://github.com/aplesner/FLIP-Reasoning-Challenge.

Abstract: Hornbills, an iconic species of Malaysia's biodiversity, face threats from habi-tat loss, poaching, and environmental changes, necessitating accurate and real-time population monitoring that is traditionally challenging and re-source intensive. The emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) offers a chance to transform wildlife monitoring by enabling efficient, real-time da-ta analysis directly on edge devices. Addressing the challenge of wildlife conservation, this research paper explores the pivotal role of machine learn-ing, specifically TinyML, in the classification and monitoring of hornbill calls in Malaysia. Leveraging audio data from the Xeno-canto database, the study aims to develop a speech recognition system capable of identifying and classifying hornbill vocalizations. The proposed methodology involves pre-processing the audio data, extracting features using Mel-Frequency Energy (MFE), and deploying the model on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE, which is adept at edge computing.

Abstract: We present a geometry-driven method for normalizing dysarthric speech using local Lie group transformations of spectrograms. Time, frequency, and amplitude distortions are modeled as smooth, invertible deformations, parameterized by scalar fields and applied via exponential maps. A neural network is trained to infer these fields from synthetic distortions of typical speech-without using any pathological data. At test time, the model applies an approximate inverse to real dysarthric inputs. Despite zero-shot generalization, we observe substantial ASR gains, including up to 16 percentage points WER reduction on challenging TORGO samples, with no degradation on clean speech. This work introduces a principled, interpretable approach for robust speech recognition under motor speech disorders

<title>How Do I Do That? Synthesizing 3D Hand Motion and Contacts for Everyday Interactions</title>

Abstract: We tackle the novel problem of predicting 3D hand motion and contact maps (or Interaction Trajectories) given a single RGB view, action text, and a 3D contact point on the object as input. Our approach consists of (1) Interaction Codebook: a VQVAE model to learn a latent codebook of hand poses and contact points, effectively tokenizing interaction trajectories, (2) Interaction Predictor: a transformer-decoder module to predict the interaction trajectory from test time inputs by using an indexer module to retrieve a latent affordance from the learned codebook. To train our model, we develop a data engine that extracts 3D hand poses and contact trajectories from the diverse HoloAssist dataset. We evaluate our model on a benchmark that is 2.5-10X larger than existing works, in terms of diversity of objects and interactions observed, and test for generalization of the model across object categories, action categories, tasks, and scenes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach over transformer & diffusion baselines across all settings.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction of human heads from monocular images and videos underlies numerous visual applications. As 3D ground truth data is hard to come by at scale, previous methods have sought to learn from abundant 2D videos in a self-supervised manner. Typically, this involves the use of differentiable mesh rendering, which is effective but faces limitations. To improve on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor Learned via 2D Gaussians). Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a set of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged head avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to both the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians for rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised approach. Training solely on 2D data, our method surpasses existing self-supervised approaches in geometric evaluations on the NoW benchmark for neutral faces and a new benchmark for non-neutral expressions. Our method also produces highly expressive meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art in emotion classification.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful tool for training agents by leveraging expert knowledge, and being able to replicate a given trajectory is an integral part of it. In complex environments, like modern 3D video games, distribution shift and stochasticity necessitate robust approaches beyond simple action replay. In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.

Abstract: The prediction of traffic congestion can serve a crucial role in making future decisions. Although many studies have been conducted regarding congestion, most of these could not cover all the important factors (e.g., weather conditions). We proposed a prediction model for traffic congestion that can predict congestion based on day, time and several weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity). To evaluate our model, it has been tested against the traffic data of New Delhi. With this model, congestion of a road can be predicted one week ahead with an average RMSE of 1.12. Therefore, this model can be used to take preventive measure beforehand.

Abstract: Solving real-world complex tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) without high-fidelity simulation environments or large amounts of offline data can be quite challenging. Online RL agents trained in imperfect simulation environments can suffer from severe sim-to-real issues. Offline RL approaches although bypass the need for simulators, often pose demanding requirements on the size and quality of the offline datasets. The recently emerged hybrid offline-and-online RL provides an attractive framework that enables joint use of limited offline data and imperfect simulator for transferable policy learning. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, called H2O+, which offers great flexibility to bridge various choices of offline and online learning methods, while also accounting for dynamics gaps between the real and simulation environment. Through extensive simulation and real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate superior performance and flexibility over advanced cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms.

Abstract: Variational dimensionality reduction methods are widely used for their accuracy, generative capabilities, and robustness. We introduce a unifying framework that generalizes both such as traditional and state-of-the-art methods. The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that this framework can seamlessly incorporate diverse multi-view representation learning algorithms, providing a foundation for designing novel, problem-specific loss functions.

A three-level scale is introduced to characterize out-of-distribution generalization performance of medical AI models. This scale addresses the diversity of real-world medical scenarios as well as whether target domain data and labels are available for model recalibration. It serves as a tool to help researchers characterize their development settings and determine the best approach to tackling the challenge of out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: We propose a Block Majorization Minimization method with Extrapolation (BMMe) for solving a class of multi-convex optimization problems. The extrapolation parameters of BMMe are updated using a novel adaptive update rule. By showing that block majorization minimization can be reformulated as a block mirror descent method, with the Bregman divergence adaptively updated at each iteration, we establish subsequential convergence for BMMe. We use this method to design efficient algorithms to tackle nonnegative matrix factorization problems with the $\beta$-divergences ($\beta$-NMF) for $\beta\in [1,2]$. These algorithms, which are multiplicative updates with extrapolation, benefit from our novel results that offer convergence guarantees. We also empirically illustrate the significant acceleration of BMMe for $\beta$-NMF through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets, GFNs) are a generative framework for learning unnormalized probability mass functions over discrete spaces. Since their inception, GFlowNets have proven to be useful for learning generative models in applications where the majority of the discrete space is unvisited during training. This has inspired some to hypothesize that GFlowNets, when paired with deep neural networks (DNNs), have favorable generalization properties. In this work, we empirically verify some of the hypothesized mechanisms of generalization of GFlowNets. We accomplish this by introducing a novel graph-based benchmark environment where reward difficulty can be easily varied, $p(x)$ can be computed exactly, and an unseen test set can be constructed to quantify generalization performance. Using this graph-based environment, we are able to systematically test the hypothesized mechanisms of generalization of GFlowNets and put forth a set of empirical observations that summarize our findings. In particular, we find (and confirm) that the functions that GFlowNets learn to approximate have an implicit underlying structure which facilitate generalization. Surprisingly -- and somewhat contradictory to existing knowledge -- we also find that GFlowNets are sensitive to being trained offline and off-policy. However, the reward implicitly learned by GFlowNets is robust to changes in the training distribution.

<title>Soft Prompt Threats: Attacking Safety Alignment and Unlearning in Open-Source LLMs through the Embedding Space</title>

Abstract: Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs. Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs. They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes. We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Experimental exploration of high-cost systems with safety constraints, common in engineering applications, is a challenging endeavor. Data-driven models offer a promising solution, but acquiring the requisite data remains expensive and is potentially unsafe. Safe active learning techniques prove essential, enabling the learning of high-quality models with minimal expensive data points and high safety. This paper introduces a safe active learning framework tailored for time-varying systems, addressing drift, seasonal changes, and complexities due to dynamic behavior. The proposed Time-aware Integrated Mean Squared Prediction Error (T-IMSPE) method minimizes posterior variance over current and future states, optimizing information gathering also in the time domain. Empirical results highlight T-IMSPE's advantages in model quality through toy and real-world examples. State of the art Gaussian processes are compatible with T-IMSPE. Our theoretical contributions include a clear delineation which Gaussian process kernels, domains, and weighting measures are suitable for T-IMSPE and even beyond for its non-time aware predecessor IMSPE.

Abstract: Learning holistic computational representations in physical, chemical or biological systems requires the ability to process information from different distributions and modalities within the same model. Thus, the demand for multimodal machine learning models has sharply risen for modalities that go beyond vision and language, such as sequences, graphs, time series, or tabular data. While there are many available multimodal fusion and alignment approaches, most of them require end-to-end training, scale quadratically with the number of modalities, cannot handle cases of high modality imbalance in the training set, or are highly topology-specific, making them too restrictive for many biomedical learning tasks. This paper presents Multimodal Lego (MM-Lego), a general-purpose fusion framework to turn any set of encoders into a competitive multimodal model with no or minimal fine-tuning. We achieve this by introducing a wrapper for any unimodal encoder that enforces shape consistency between modality representations. It harmonises these representations by learning features in the frequency domain to enable model merging with little signal interference. We show that MM-Lego 1) can be used as a model merging method which achieves competitive performance with end-to-end fusion models without any fine-tuning, 2) can operate on any unimodal encoder, and 3) is a model fusion method that, with minimal fine-tuning, surpasses all benchmarks in five out of seven datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries manipulate model predictions by inserting malicious samples into the training data. Currently, there is still a significant challenge in identifying suspicious training data to unveil potential backdoor samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Prediction Shift Backdoor Detection (PSBD), leveraging an uncertainty-based approach requiring minimal unlabeled clean validation data. PSBD is motivated by an intriguing Prediction Shift (PS) phenomenon, where poisoned models' predictions on clean data often shift away from true labels towards certain other labels with dropout applied during inference, while backdoor samples exhibit less PS. We hypothesize PS results from the neuron bias effect, making neurons favor features of certain classes. PSBD identifies backdoor training samples by computing the Prediction Shift Uncertainty (PSU), the variance in probability values when dropout layers are toggled on and off during model inference. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PSBD, which achieves state-of-the-art results among mainstream detection methods. The code is available at https://github.com/WL-619/PSBD.

Abstract: Prior theory work on Contrastive Learning via the InfoNCE loss showed that, under certain assumptions, the learned representations recover the ground-truth latent factors. We argue that these theories overlook crucial aspects of how CL is deployed in practice. Specifically, they either assume equal variance across all latents or that certain latents are kept invariant. However, in practice, positive pairs are often generated using augmentations such as strong cropping to just a few pixels. Hence, a more realistic assumption is that all latent factors change with a continuum of variability across all factors. We introduce AnInfoNCE, a generalization of InfoNCE that can provably uncover the latent factors in this anisotropic setting, broadly generalizing previous identifiability results in CL. We validate our identifiability results in controlled experiments and show that AnInfoNCE increases the recovery of previously collapsed information in CIFAR10 and ImageNet, albeit at the cost of downstream accuracy. Finally, we discuss the remaining mismatches between theoretical assumptions and practical implementations.

Abstract: We introduce RoboMorph, an automated approach for generating and optimizing modular robot designs using large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary algorithms. In this framework, we represent each robot design as a grammar and leverage the capabilities of LLMs to navigate the extensive robot design space, which is traditionally time-consuming and computationally demanding. By introducing a best-shot prompting technique and a reinforcement learning-based control algorithm, RoboMorph iteratively improves robot designs through feedback loops. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMorph successfully generates nontrivial robots optimized for different terrains while showcasing improvements in robot morphology over successive evolutions. Our approach highlights the potential of using LLMs for data-driven, modular robot design, providing a promising methodology that can be extended to other domains with similar design frameworks.

Abstract: Contextual dueling bandit is used to model the bandit problems, where a learner's goal is to find the best arm for a given context using observed noisy human preference feedback over the selected arms for the past contexts. However, existing algorithms assume the reward function is linear, which can be complex and non-linear in many real-life applications like online recommendations or ranking web search results. To overcome this challenge, we use a neural network to estimate the reward function using preference feedback for the previously selected arms. We propose upper confidence bound- and Thompson sampling-based algorithms with sub-linear regret guarantees that efficiently select arms in each round. We also extend our theoretical results to contextual bandit problems with binary feedback, which is in itself a non-trivial contribution. Experimental results on the problem instances derived from synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical results.

Abstract: This study explores integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with idealised climate models to address key parameterisation challenges in climate science. Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics. Overall, this work represents an important first step towards leveraging RL to enhance climate model accuracy, critical for improving climate understanding and predictions.

Abstract: Active learning enhances the performance of machine learning methods, particularly in semi-supervised cases, by judiciously selecting a limited number of unlabeled data points for labeling, with the goal of improving the performance of an underlying classifier. In this work, we introduce the Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs (MALADY) framework which leverages the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for efficient active learning. In particular, we generalize the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for semi-supervised learning in [24] to incorporate a more general optimization functional. Moreover, we introduce a novel active learning acquisition function that uses the dual variable of the auction algorithm to measure the uncertainty in the classifier to prioritize queries near the decision boundaries between different classes. Lastly, using experiments on classification tasks, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and show that it exceeds that of comparison algorithms.

Abstract: Relative representations are an established approach to zero-shot model stitching, consisting of a non-trainable transformation of the latent space of a deep neural network. Based on insights of topological and geometric nature, we propose two improvements to relative representations. First, we introduce a normalization procedure in the relative transformation, resulting in invariance to non-isotropic rescalings and permutations. The latter coincides with the symmetries in parameter space induced by common activation functions. Second, we propose to deploy topological densification when fine-tuning relative representations, a topological regularization loss encouraging clustering within classes. We provide an empirical investigation on a natural language task, where both the proposed variations yield improved performance on zero-shot model stitching.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small, interpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task. Conventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high dimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction difficult. Motivated by the extensive knowledge encoded in pre-trained LLMs and their success in processing complex biomedical concepts, we set to examine the ability of LLMs in feature selection and engineering for tabular genotype data, with a novel knowledge-driven framework. We develop FREEFORM, Free-flow Reasoning and Ensembling for Enhanced Feature Output and Robust Modeling, designed with chain-of-thought and ensembling principles, to select and engineer features with the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Evaluated on two distinct genotype-phenotype datasets, genetic ancestry and hereditary hearing loss, we find this framework outperforms several data-driven methods, particularly on low-shot regimes. FREEFORM is available as open-source framework at GitHub: https://github.com/PennShenLab/FREEFORM.

Abstract: Statistical data heterogeneity is a significant barrier to convergence in federated learning (FL). While prior work has advanced heterogeneous FL through better optimization objectives, these methods fall short when there is extreme data heterogeneity among collaborating participants. We hypothesize that convergence under extreme data heterogeneity is primarily hindered due to the aggregation of conflicting updates from the participants in the initial collaboration rounds. To overcome this problem, we propose a warmup phase where each participant learns a personalized mask and updates only a subnetwork of the full model. This personalized warmup allows the participants to focus initially on learning specific subnetworks tailored to the heterogeneity of their data. After the warmup phase, the participants revert to standard federated optimization, where all parameters are communicated. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed personalized warmup via subnetworks (FedPeWS) approach improves accuracy and convergence speed over standard federated optimization methods.

Abstract: We introduce SMALLTALK LM, an innovative method for training a mixture of language models in an almost asynchronous manner. Each model of the mixture specializes in distinct parts of the data distribution, without the need for high-bandwidth communication between the nodes training each model. At inference, a lightweight router directs a given sequence to a single expert, according to a short prefix. This inference scheme naturally uses a fraction of the parameters from the overall mixture model. Unlike prior works on asynchronous LLM training, our routing method does not rely on full corpus clustering or access to metadata, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Our experiments on language modeling demonstrate that SMALLTALK LM achieves significantly lower perplexity than dense model baselines for the same total training FLOPs and an almost identical inference cost. Finally, in our downstream evaluations we outperform the dense baseline on 75% of the tasks.

Abstract: Time series classification underpins critical applications such as healthcare diagnostics and gesture-driven interactive systems in multimedia scenarios. However, time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) faces two major challenges: catastrophic forgetting and intra-class variations. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because gradient-based parameter update strategies inevitably erase past knowledge. And unlike images, time series data exhibits subject-specific patterns, also known as intra-class variations, which refer to differences in patterns observed within the same class. While exemplar-based methods fail to cover diverse variation with limited samples, existing exemplar-free methods lack explicit mechanisms to handle intra-class variations. To address these two challenges, we propose TS-ACL, which leverages a gradient-free closed-form solution to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem inherent in gradient-based optimization methods while simultaneously learning global distributions to resolve intra-class variations. Additionally, it provides privacy protection and efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets covering various sensor modalities and tasks demonstrate that TS-ACL achieves performance close to joint training on four datasets, outperforming existing methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for TSCIL.

Abstract: Despite the growing use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for AI-assisted diagnosis prediction, most data-driven models struggle to incorporate clinically meaningful medical knowledge. They often rely on limited ontologies, lacking structured reasoning capabilities and comprehensive coverage. This raises an important research question: Will medical knowledge improve predictive models to support stepwise clinical reasoning as performed by human doctors? To address this problem, we propose DuaLK, a dual-expertise framework that combines two complementary sources of information. For external knowledge, we construct a Diagnosis Knowledge Graph (KG) that encodes both hierarchical and semantic relations enriched by large language models (LLM). To align with patient data, we further introduce a lab-informed proxy task that guides the model to follow a clinically consistent, stepwise reasoning process based on lab test signals. Experimental results on two public EHR datasets demonstrate that DuaLK consistently outperforms existing baselines across four clinical prediction tasks. These findings highlight the potential of combining structured medical knowledge with individual-level clinical signals to achieve more accurate and interpretable diagnostic predictions. The source code is publicly available on https://github.com/humphreyhuu/DuaLK.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a pivotal method in machine learning for modeling functions over graphs. Despite their widespread success across various applications, their statistical properties (e.g., consistency, convergence rates) remain ill-characterized. To begin addressing this knowledge gap, we consider networks for which the graph structure implies that neighboring nodes exhibit similar signals and provide statistical theory for the impact of convolution operators. Focusing on estimators based solely on neighborhood aggregation, we examine how two common convolutions - the original GCN and GraphSAGE convolutions - affect the learning error as a function of the neighborhood topology and the number of convolutional layers. We explicitly characterize the bias-variance type trade-off incurred by GCNs as a function of the neighborhood size and identify specific graph topologies where convolution operators are less effective. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by synthetic experiments, and provide a start to a deeper quantitative understanding of convolutional effects in GCNs for offering rigorous guidelines for practitioners.

<title>Chemical Language Model Linker: blending text and molecules with modular adapters</title>

Abstract: The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.

Abstract: We model the evolution of tokens within a deep stack of Transformer layers as a continuous-time flow on the unit sphere, governed by a mean-field interacting particle system, building on the framework introduced in (Geshkovski et al., 2023). Studying the corresponding mean-field Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which can be interpreted as a Wasserstein gradient flow, in this paper we provide a mathematical investigation of the long-term behavior of this system, with a particular focus on the emergence and persistence of meta-stable phases and clustering phenomena, key elements in applications like next-token prediction. More specifically, we perform a perturbative analysis of the mean-field PDE around the iid uniform initialization and prove that, in the limit of large number of tokens, the model remains close to a meta-stable manifold of solutions with a given structure (e.g., periodicity). Further, the structure characterizing the meta-stable manifold is explicitly identified, as a function of the inverse temperature parameter of the model, by the index maximizing a certain rescaling of Gegenbauer polynomials.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) through Transformer structures have dominated many machine learning tasks, especially text processing. However, these models require massive amounts of data for training and induce high resource requirements, particularly in terms of the large number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and the high amounts of memory needed. To fine-tune such a model in a parameter-efficient way, techniques like Adapter or LoRA have been developed. However, we observe that the application of LoRA, when used in federated learning (FL), while still being parameter-efficient, is memory and FLOP inefficient. Based on that observation, we develop a novel layer finetuning scheme that allows devices in cross-device FL to make use of pretrained neural networks (NNs) while adhering to given resource constraints. We show that our presented scheme outperforms the current state of the art when dealing with homogeneous or heterogeneous computation and memory constraints and is on par with LoRA regarding limited communication, thereby achieving significantly higher accuracies in FL training.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, to collaboratively train a global machine learning model while keeping their data localized. However, recent studies have revealed that the training phase of FL is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, such as attribute inference attacks (AIA), where adversaries exploit exchanged messages and auxiliary public information to uncover sensitive attributes of targeted clients. While these attacks have been extensively studied in the context of classification tasks, their impact on regression tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing novel model-based AIAs specifically designed for regression tasks in FL environments. Our approach considers scenarios where adversaries can either eavesdrop on exchanged messages or directly interfere with the training process. We benchmark our proposed attacks against state-of-the-art methods using real-world datasets. The results demonstrate a significant increase in reconstruction accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous client datasets, a common scenario in FL. The efficacy of our model-based AIAs makes them better candidates for empirically quantifying privacy leakage for federated regression tasks.

Abstract: Centralization enhances the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but it also brings critical challenges, such as single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues, for AI systems. These problems are especially common in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used with full transparency. To address these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has been introduced. DeAI leverages the strengths of blockchain technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, as well as trustworthiness of AI systems. Although DeAI has been widely developed in industry, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art practical DeAI solutions is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. Specifically, we analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigate how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, and also ensure fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we provide key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols for future research.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a key paradigm in privacy-preserving computing due to its "data usable but not visible" property, enabling users to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Motivated by this, federated recommendation systems offer a promising architecture that balances user privacy with recommendation accuracy through distributed collaborative learning. However, existing federated recommendation methods often neglect the underlying semantic or behavioral relationships between users during parameter aggregation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, graph-based federated recommendation systems have been proposed to leverage neighborhood information. Yet, conventional graph construction methods usually require access to raw user data or explicit social links, which contradicts the strict privacy requirements of federated learning. In this work, we propose UFGraphFR (User Text-feature-based Graph Federated Recommendation), a personalized federated recommendation framework that constructs a user graph based on clients' locally embedded text features. Our core assumption is that users with similar textual descriptions exhibit similar preferences. UFGraphFR introduces two key components: a privacy-preserving user relationship graph built from the joint embedding layer's weight matrix without leaking raw user attributes, and a Transformer-based architecture to model temporal dependencies in user-item interaction sequences. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as MovieLens and HetRec2011 demonstrate that UFGraphFR achieves competitive accuracy compared to centralized and state-of-the-art federated baselines while preserving user privacy.

Abstract: Continual Learning seeks to develop a model capable of incrementally assimilating new information while retaining prior knowledge. However, current research predominantly addresses a straightforward learning context, wherein all data samples originate from a singular data domain. This paper shifts focus to a more complex and realistic learning environment, characterized by data samples sourced from multiple distinct domains. We tackle this intricate learning challenge by introducing a novel methodology, termed the Multi-Source Dynamic Expansion Model (MSDEM), which leverages various pre-trained models as backbones and progressively establishes new experts based on them to adapt to emerging tasks. Additionally, we propose an innovative dynamic expandable attention mechanism designed to selectively harness knowledge from multiple backbones, thereby accelerating the new task learning. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic graph weight router that strategically reuses all previously acquired parameters and representations for new task learning, maximizing the positive knowledge transfer effect, which further improves generalization performance. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, and the empirical findings indicate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent and adaptive cyber defense systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: policies that demonstrate resilience to certain types of unexpected dynamic network topology changes, reasonable generalisation to networks of varying sizes within the same structural distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate that GAT defensive policies can be trained using our low-level directed graph observations, even when unexpected connections arise during simulation. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns a diffusion model with input prompt, has become a crucial step in building reliable generative AI models. Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical constraints into deep learning models. However, standard PINNs often require a large number of training samples to achieve high accuracy, leading to increased computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning-Driven PINNs (AL-PINN), which integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Active Learning (AL) strategies to optimize sample selection dynamically.
  AL-PINN utilizes Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate epistemic uncertainty in the model predictions, enabling the adaptive selection of high-uncertainty regions for additional training. This approach significantly enhances learning efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most informative data points. We evaluate AL-PINN on benchmark PDE problems with known analytical solutions and real-world WeatherBench climate data. Our results demonstrate that AL-PINN achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to traditional PINNs while reducing the number of required training samples.
  The proposed framework is particularly beneficial for scientific and engineering applications where data collection is expensive or limited, such as climate modeling, medical simulations, and material science. Our findings highlight the potential of active learning in accelerating PINN-based PDE solvers while maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural network training. However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics.
  To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs.
  This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a significant challenge in machine learning, where a model forgets previously learned information upon learning new tasks. Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they continue to face challenges with CF during continual learning. The majority of existing research focuses on analyzing forgetting patterns through a singular training sequence, thereby overlooking the intricate effects that diverse tasks have on model behavior. Our study explores CF across various settings, discovering that model forgetting is influenced by both the specific training tasks and the models themselves. To this end, we interpret forgetting by examining the function vector (FV), a compact representation of functions in LLMs, offering a model-dependent indicator for the occurrence of CF. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrated that CF in LLMs primarily stems from biases in function activation rather than the overwriting of task processing functions. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel function vector guided training methodology, incorporating a regularization technique to stabilize the FV and mitigate forgetting. Empirical tests on four benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed training method, substantiating our theoretical framework concerning CF and model function dynamics. We plan to make our code publicly accessible in the near future.

Abstract: Human and animal memory for sequentially presented items is well-documented to be more accurate for those at the beginning and end of the sequence, phenomena known as the primacy and recency effects, respectively. By contrast, artificial neural network (ANN) models are typically designed with a memory that decays monotonically over time. Accordingly, ANNs are expected to show the recency effect but not the primacy effect. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: a recently developed ANN architecture, called structured state-space models, exhibits the primacy effect when trained and evaluated on a synthetic task that mirrors psychological memory experiments. Given that this model was originally designed for recovering neuronal activity patterns observed in biological brains, this result provides a novel perspective on the psychological primacy effect while also posing a non-trivial puzzle for the current theories in machine learning.

Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.

Through experiments across more than 150 datasets derived from GridWorld and MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that optimizing RL objectives improves performance by approximately 40% on average compared to the widely established Algorithm Distillation (AD) baseline across various dataset coverages, structures, expertise levels, and environmental complexities. Our results also reveal that offline RL-based methods outperform online approaches, which are not specifically designed for offline scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of aligning the learning objectives with RL's reward-maximization goal and demonstrate that offline RL is a promising direction for application in ICRL settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for multi-label emotion detection, where Llama-3 is used to generate explanatory content that clarifies ambiguous emotional expressions, thereby enhancing RoBERTa's emotion classification performance. By incorporating explanatory context, our method improves F1-scores, particularly for emotions like fear, joy, and sadness, and outperforms text-only models. The addition of explanatory content helps resolve ambiguity, addresses challenges like overlapping emotional cues, and enhances multi-label classification, marking a significant advancement in emotion detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have sparked significant interest in understanding their inner workings. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling transformer architectures using highly flexible non-autonomous neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our proposed model parameterizes all weights of attention and feed-forward blocks through neural networks, expressing these weights as functions of a continuous layer index. Through spectral analysis of the model's dynamics, we uncover an increase in eigenvalue magnitude that challenges the weight-sharing assumption prevalent in existing theoretical studies. We also leverage the Lyapunov exponent to examine token-level sensitivity, enhancing model interpretability. Our neural ODE transformer demonstrates performance comparable to or better than vanilla transformers across various configurations and datasets, while offering flexible fine-tuning capabilities that can adapt to different architectural constraints.

Abstract: This paper provides an invariant federated learning system for resource-constrained edge intelligence. This framework can mitigate the impact of heterogeneity and asynchrony via exit strategy and invariant penalty. We introduce parameter orthogonality into edge intelligence to measure the contribution or impact of heterogeneous and asynchronous clients. It is proved in this paper that the exit of abnormal edge clients can guarantee the effect of the model on most clients. Meanwhile, to ensure the models' performance on exited abnormal clients and those who lack training resources, we propose Federated Learning with Invariant Penalty for Generalization (FedIPG) by constructing the approximate orthogonality of the invariant parameters and the heterogeneous parameters. Theoretical proof shows that FedIPG reduces the Out-Of-Distribution prediction loss without increasing the communication burden. The performance of FedIPG combined with an exit strategy is tested empirically in multiple scales using four datasets. It shows our system can enhance In-Distribution performance and outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm in Out-Of-Distribution generalization while maintaining model convergence. Additionally, the results of the visual experiment prove that FedIPG contains preliminary causality in terms of ignoring confounding features.

Abstract: We present FourierNAT, a novel non-autoregressive Transformer (NAT) architecture that employs Fourier-based mixing in the decoder to generate output sequences in parallel. While traditional NAT approaches often face challenges with capturing global dependencies, our method leverages a discrete Fourier transform to mix token embeddings across the entire sequence dimension, coupled with learned frequency-domain gating. This allows the model to efficiently propagate context without explicit autoregressive steps. Empirically, FourierNAT achieves competitive results against leading NAT baselines on standard benchmarks like WMT machine translation and CNN/DailyMail summarization, providing significant speed advantages over autoregressive Transformers. We further demonstrate that learned frequency-domain parameters allow the model to adaptively focus on long-range or short-range dependencies, partially mitigating the well-known coherence gaps in one-pass NAT generation. Overall, FourierNAT highlights the potential of integrating spectral-domain operations to accelerate and improve parallel text generation. This approach can potentially provide great computational and time savings in inference tasks LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images to extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models for small molecule drug discovery have shown immense promise, but many molecules they generate are too difficult to synthesize, making them impractical for further investigation or development. In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers strong performance in bottom-up synthesis, synthesizable analog generation, and hit expansion, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for drug discovery developments. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins.

<title>Improving Generalization of Universal Adversarial Perturbation via Dynamic Maximin Optimization</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs). These perturbations are meticulously designed to fool the target model universally across all sample classes. Unlike instance-specific adversarial examples (AEs), generating UAPs is more complex because they must be generalized across a wide range of data samples and models. Our research reveals that existing universal attack methods, which optimize UAPs using DNNs with static model parameter snapshots, do not fully leverage the potential of DNNs to generate more effective UAPs. Rather than optimizing UAPs against static DNN models with a fixed training set, we suggest using dynamic model-data pairs to generate UAPs. In particular, we introduce a dynamic maximin optimization strategy, aiming to optimize the UAP across a variety of optimal model-data pairs. We term this approach DM-UAP. DM-UAP utilizes an iterative max-min-min optimization framework that refines the model-data pairs, coupled with a curriculum UAP learning algorithm to examine the combined space of model parameters and data thoroughly. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed DM-UAP markedly enhances both cross-sample universality and cross-model transferability of UAPs. Using only 500 samples for UAP generation, DM-UAP outperforms the state-of-the-art approach with an average increase in fooling ratio of 12.108%.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose BR-MTRL, a Byzantine-resilient multi-task representation learning framework that handles faulty or malicious agents. Our approach leverages representation learning through a shared neural network model, where all clients share fixed layers, except for a client-specific final layer. This structure captures shared features among clients while enabling individual adaptation, making it a promising approach for leveraging client data and computational power in heterogeneous federated settings to learn personalized models. To learn the model, we employ an alternating gradient descent strategy: each client optimizes its local model, updates its final layer, and sends estimates of the shared representation to a central server for aggregation. To defend against Byzantine agents, we employ two robust aggregation methods for client-server communication, Geometric Median and Krum. Our method enables personalized learning while maintaining resilience in distributed settings. We implemented the proposed algorithm in a federated testbed built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and compared its performance with various benchmark algorithms and their variations. Through experiments using real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST, we demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and its transferability to new unseen clients with limited data, even in the presence of Byzantine adversaries.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Symmetric Low-Rank Adapters, an optimized variant of LoRA with even fewer weights. This method utilizes Low-Rank Symmetric Weight Matrices to learn downstream tasks more efficiently. Traditional LoRA accumulates fine-tuning weights with the original pre-trained weights via a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) like approach, i.e., model weights are fine-tuned via updates of the form $BA$ (where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times n}$, and $r$ is the rank of the merged weight matrix). In contrast, our approach, named SymLoRA, represents fine-tuning weights as a Spectral Decomposition, i.e., $Q \, diag(\Lambda)\, Q^T$, where $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ and $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^r$. SymLoRA requires approximately half of the finetuning weights. Here, we show that this approach has negligible losses in downstream efficacy.

Abstract: Modeling stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is crucial for understanding complex dynamical systems in various scientific fields. Recent methods often employ neural network-based models, which typically represent SDEs through a combination of deterministic and stochastic terms. However, these models usually lack interpretability and have difficulty generalizing beyond their training domain. This paper introduces the Finite Expression Method (FEX), a symbolic learning approach designed to derive interpretable mathematical representations of the deterministic component of SDEs. For the stochastic component, we integrate FEX with advanced generative modeling techniques to provide a comprehensive representation of SDEs. The numerical experiments on linear, nonlinear, and multidimensional SDEs demonstrate that FEX generalizes well beyond the training domain and delivers more accurate long-term predictions compared to neural network-based methods. The symbolic expressions identified by FEX not only improve prediction accuracy but also offer valuable scientific insights into the underlying dynamics of the systems, paving the way for new scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Incomplete data, confounding effects, and violations of the Markov property are interrelated problems which are ubiquitous in Reinforcement Learning applications. We introduce the concept of ``partial ignorabilty" and leverage it to establish a novel convergence theorem for adaptive Reinforcement Learning. This theoretical result relaxes the Markov assumption on the stochastic process underlying conventional $Q$-learning, deploying a generalized form of the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation theorem to establish optimality. This result has clear downstream implications for most active subfields of Reinforcement Learning, with clear paths for extension to the field of Causal Inference.

Abstract: Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: selection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables shared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of misalignment on multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models depends heavily on test samples at runtime, and shifts from the training data distribution can significantly reduce accuracy. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models during inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original training set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like algorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model architectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to mobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark designed to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge devices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources and usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to categories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts within a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios using benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed. Furthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by advocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation. Experiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small datasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity and complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific resource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\times$ with $512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi versus the base model. BoTTA offers actionable guidance for TTA in real-world, resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) epitomizes an advanced training paradigm wherein prior data samples remain inaccessible during the acquisition of new tasks. Numerous investigations have delved into leveraging a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to enhance model efficacy in continual learning. Nonetheless, these approaches typically utilize a singular, static backbone, which inadequately adapts to novel tasks, particularly when engaging with diverse data domains, due to a substantial number of inactive parameters. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing an innovative Self-Controlled Dynamic Expansion Model (SCDEM), which orchestrates multiple distinct trainable pre-trained ViT backbones to furnish diverse and semantically enriched representations. Specifically, by employing the multi-backbone architecture as a shared module, the proposed SCDEM dynamically generates a new expert with minimal parameters to accommodate a new task. A novel Collaborative Optimization Mechanism (COM) is introduced to synergistically optimize multiple backbones by harnessing prediction signals from historical experts, thereby facilitating new task learning without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Additionally, a novel Feature Distribution Consistency (FDC) approach is proposed to align semantic similarity between previously and currently learned representations through an optimal transport distance-based mechanism, effectively mitigating negative knowledge transfer effects. Furthermore, to alleviate over-regularization challenges, this paper presents a novel Dynamic Layer-Wise Feature Attention Mechanism (DLWFAM) to autonomously determine the penalization intensity on each trainable representation layer. An extensive series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed methodology's efficacy, with empirical results corroborating that the approach attains state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepancies between predictions and target values. However, these metrics do not directly evaluate the physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly critical concern in scientific and engineering applications.
  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine learning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system. Addressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine learning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in applications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.
  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting error metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the underlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed dynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse persistence ($\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors -- e.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity) and higher $\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical consistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that measure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\theta$ versus their correct values. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and recursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world weather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in dynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times or long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML forecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) support efficient deployments on resource-constrained edge devices, but their limited capacity compromises inference performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution to enhance model performance by integrating external databases, without requiring intensive on-device model retraining. However, large-scale public databases and user-specific private contextual documents are typically located on the cloud and the device separately, while existing RAG implementations are primarily centralized. To bridge this gap, we propose DRAGON, a distributed RAG framework to enhance on-device SLMs through both general and personal knowledge without the risk of leaking document privacy. Specifically, DRAGON decomposes multi-document RAG into multiple parallel token generation processes performed independently and locally on the cloud and the device, and employs a newly designed Speculative Aggregation, a dual-side speculative algorithm to avoid frequent output synchronization between the cloud and device. A new scheduling algorithm is further introduced to identify the optimal aggregation side based on real-time network conditions. Evaluations on real-world hardware testbed demonstrate a significant performance improvement of DRAGON-up to 1.9x greater gains over standalone SLM compared to the centralized RAG, substantial reduction in per-token latency, and negligible Time to First Token (TTFT) overhead.

Abstract: Numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) face challenges balancing computational cost and accuracy, especially in multiscale and dynamic systems. Neural operators can significantly speed up simulations; however, they often face challenges such as error accumulation and limited generalization in multiphysics problems. This work introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates physics-informed DeepONet with FEM through domain decomposition. The core innovation lies in adaptively coupling FEM and DeepONet subdomains via a Schwarz alternating method. This methodology strategically allocates computationally demanding regions to a pre-trained Deep Operator Network, while the remaining computational domain is solved through FEM. To address dynamic systems, we integrate the Newmark time-stepping scheme directly into the DeepONet, significantly mitigating error accumulation in long-term simulations. Furthermore, an adaptive subdomain evolution enables the ML-resolved region to expand dynamically, capturing emerging fine-scale features without remeshing. The framework's efficacy has been validated across a range of solid mechanics problems, including static, quasi-static, and dynamic regimes, demonstrating accelerated convergence rates (up to 20% improvement compared to FE-FE approaches), while preserving solution fidelity with error < 1%. Our case studies show that our proposed hybrid solver: (1) maintains solution continuity across subdomain interfaces, (2) reduces computational costs by eliminating fine mesh requirements, (3) mitigates error accumulation in time-dependent simulations, and (4) enables automatic adaptation to evolving physical phenomena. This work bridges the gap between numerical methods and AI-driven surrogates, offering a scalable pathway for high-fidelity simulations in engineering and scientific applications.

Abstract: Multimodal protein language models (PLMs) integrate sequence and token-based structural information, serving as a powerful foundation for protein modeling, generation, and design. However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.

Abstract: An important feature of kernel mean embeddings (KME) is that the rate of convergence of the empirical KME to the true distribution KME can be bounded independently of the dimension of the space, properties of the distribution and smoothness features of the kernel. We show how to speed-up convergence by leveraging variance information in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Furthermore, we show that even when such information is a priori unknown, we can efficiently estimate it from the data, recovering the desiderata of a distribution agnostic bound that enjoys acceleration in fortuitous settings. We further extend our results from independent data to stationary mixing sequences and illustrate our methods in the context of hypothesis testing and robust parametric estimation.

Abstract: Health sensing for chronic disease management creates immense benefits for social welfare. Existing health sensing studies primarily focus on the prediction of physical chronic diseases. Depression, a widespread complication of chronic diseases, is however understudied. We draw on the medical literature to support depression detection using motion sensor data. To connect humans in this decision-making, safeguard trust, and ensure algorithm transparency, we develop an interpretable deep learning model: Temporal Prototype Network (TempPNet). TempPNet is built upon the emergent prototype learning models. To accommodate the temporal characteristic of sensor data and the progressive property of depression, TempPNet differs from existing prototype learning models in its capability of capturing temporal progressions of prototypes. Extensive empirical analyses using real-world motion sensor data show that TempPNet outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in depression detection. Moreover, TempPNet interprets its decision by visualizing the temporal progression of depression and its corresponding symptoms detected from sensor data. We further employ a user study and a medical expert panel to demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study offers an algorithmic solution for impactful social good -- collaborative care of chronic diseases and depression in health sensing. Methodologically, it contributes to extant literature with a novel interpretable deep learning model for depression detection from sensor data. Patients, doctors, and caregivers can deploy our model on mobile devices to monitor patients' depression risks in real-time. Our model's interpretability also allows human experts to participate in the decision-making by reviewing the interpretation and making informed interventions.

Abstract: Purpose: To present and evaluate Dafne (deep anatomical federated network), a freely available decentralized, collaborative deep learning system for the semantic segmentation of radiological images through federated incremental learning. Materials and Methods: Dafne is free software with a client-server architecture. The client side is an advanced user interface that applies the deep learning models stored on the server to the user's data and allows the user to check and refine the prediction. Incremental learning is then performed at the client's side and sent back to the server, where it is integrated into the root model. Dafne was evaluated locally, by assessing the performance gain across model generations on 38 MRI datasets of the lower legs, and through the analysis of real-world usage statistics (n = 639 use-cases). Results: Dafne demonstrated a statistically improvement in the accuracy of semantic segmentation over time (average increase of the Dice Similarity Coefficient by 0.007 points/generation on the local validation set, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, the models showed enhanced performance on various radiologic image types, including those not present in the initial training sets, indicating good model generalizability. Conclusion: Dafne showed improvement in segmentation quality over time, demonstrating potential for learning and generalization.

Abstract: Finding the parameters of a latent variable causal model is central to causal inference and causal identification. In this article, we show that existing graphical structures that are used in causal inference are not stable under marginalization of Gaussian Bayesian networks, and present a graphical structure that faithfully represent margins of Gaussian Bayesian networks. We present the first duality between parameter optimization of a latent variable model and training a feed-forward neural network in the parameter space of the assumed family of distributions. Based on this observation, we develop an algorithm for parameter optimization of these graphical structures based on a given observational distribution. Then, we provide conditions for causal effect identifiability in the Gaussian setting. We propose an meta-algorithm that checks whether a causal effect is identifiable or not. Moreover, we lay a grounding for generalizing the duality between a neural network and a causal model from the Gaussian to other distributions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel generative model, the Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN), that approximates data distribution using hierarchical discrete distributions. We posit that since the features within a network inherently capture distributional information, enabling the network to generate multiple samples simultaneously, rather than a single output, may offer an effective way to represent distributions. Therefore, DDN fits the target distribution, including continuous ones, by generating multiple discrete sample points. To capture finer details of the target data, DDN selects the output that is closest to the Ground Truth (GT) from the coarse results generated in the first layer. This selected output is then fed back into the network as a condition for the second layer, thereby generating new outputs more similar to the GT. As the number of DDN layers increases, the representational space of the outputs expands exponentially, and the generated samples become increasingly similar to the GT. This hierarchical output pattern of discrete distributions endows DDN with unique properties: more general zero-shot conditional generation and 1D latent representation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DDN and its intriguing properties through experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. The code is available at https://discrete-distribution-networks.github.io/

<title>Strategic Client Selection to Address Non-IIDness in HAPS-enabled FL Networks</title>

Abstract: The deployment of federated learning (FL) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN) that are supported by high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) offers numerous advantages. Due to its large footprint, it facilitates interaction with a large number of line-of-sight (LoS) ground clients, each possessing diverse datasets along with distinct communication and computational capabilities. The presence of many clients enhances the accuracy of the FL model and speeds up convergence. However, the variety of datasets among these clients poses a significant challenge, as it leads to pervasive non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The data non-IIDness results in markedly reduced training accuracy and slower convergence rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted attribute-based client selection strategy that leverages multiple user-specific attributes, including historical traffic patterns, instantaneous channel conditions, computational capabilities, and previous-round learning performance. By combining these attributes into a composite score for each user at every FL round and selecting users with higher scores as FL clients, the framework ensures more uniform and representative data distributions, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of non-IID data. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed client selection strategy in enhancing FL model accuracy and convergence rate, as well as reducing training loss, by effectively addressing the critical challenge of data non-IIDness in large-scale FL system implementations.

<title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>

Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.

Abstract: We study the often overlooked phenomenon, first noted in \cite{breiman2001random}, that random forests appear to reduce bias compared to bagging. Motivated by an interesting paper by \cite{mentch2020randomization}, where the authors explain the success of random forests in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings through regularization, we explore how random forests can capture patterns in the data that bagging ensembles fail to capture. We empirically demonstrate that in the presence of such patterns, random forests reduce bias along with variance and can increasingly outperform bagging ensembles when SNR is high. Our observations offer insights into the real-world success of random forests across a range of SNRs and enhance our understanding of the difference between random forests and bagging ensembles. Our investigations also yield practical insights into the importance of tuning $mtry$ in random forests.

<title>a-DCF: an architecture agnostic metric with application to spoofing-robust speaker verification</title>

Abstract: Spoofing detection is today a mainstream research topic. Standard metrics can be applied to evaluate the performance of isolated spoofing detection solutions and others have been proposed to support their evaluation when they are combined with speaker detection. These either have well-known deficiencies or restrict the architectural approach to combine speaker and spoof detectors. In this paper, we propose an architecture-agnostic detection cost function (a-DCF). A generalisation of the original DCF used widely for the assessment of automatic speaker verification (ASV), the a-DCF is designed for the evaluation of spoofing-robust ASV. Like the DCF, the a-DCF reflects the cost of decisions in a Bayes risk sense, with explicitly defined class priors and detection cost model. We demonstrate the merit of the a-DCF through the benchmarking evaluation of architecturally-heterogeneous spoofing-robust ASV solutions.

Abstract: The study of the Two-Body and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems in the field of aerospace engineering and sciences is deeply important because they help describe the motion of both celestial and artificial satellites. With the growing demand for satellites and satellite formation flying, fast and efficient control of these systems is becoming ever more important. Global linearization of these systems allows engineers to employ methods of control in order to achieve these desired results. We propose a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of the Circular, Elliptical and Perturbed Two-Body Problem as well as the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem around the L1 Lagrange point via deep learning-based Koopman Theory, i.e., a framework that can identify the underlying dynamics and globally linearize it into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The linear Koopman operator is discovered through purely data-driven training of a Deep Neural Network with a custom architecture. This paper displays the ability of the Koopman operator to generalize to various other Two-Body systems without the need for retraining. We also demonstrate the capability of the same architecture to be utilized to accurately learn a Koopman operator that approximates the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that outperforms competitors with consistency and motion. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/StreamingT2V

<title>Two Effects, One Trigger: On the Modality Gap, Object Bias, and Information Imbalance in Contrastive Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs), like CLIP, have gained popularity for their versatile applicability to various downstream tasks. Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot object recognition, they perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute recognition. Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separation of image and text in the shared representation space, and to a bias towards objects over other factors, such as attributes. In this analysis paper, we investigate both phenomena thoroughly. We evaluated off-the-shelf VLMs and while the gap's influence on performance is typically overshadowed by other factors, we find indications that closing the gap indeed leads to improvements. Moreover, we find that, contrary to intuition, only few embedding dimensions drive the gap and that the embedding spaces are differently organized. To allow for a clean study of object bias, we introduce a definition and a corresponding measure of it. Equipped with this tool, we find that object bias does not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes per se. However, why do both phenomena, modality gap and object bias, emerge in the first place? To answer this fundamental question and uncover some of the inner workings of contrastive VLMs, we conducted experiments that allowed us to control the amount of shared information between the modalities. These experiments revealed that the driving factor behind both the modality gap and the object bias, is an information imbalance between images and captions, and unveiled an intriguing connection between the modality gap and entropy of the logits.

<title>Understanding the Performance Horizon of the Latest ML Workloads with NonGEMM Workloads</title>

Abstract: Among ML operators today, GEneralMatrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based operators are known to be key operators that build the main backbone of ML models. As their computational overhead dominates the overall execution time (e.g., 42.8% - 96.6% in our results), GEMM operators have been the prime optimization targets for fast ML inference. This led to advanced GPUs and accelerators available today, which provided significant boost in the GEMM performance compared to CPUs, aligned with the lesson from Amdahl's law. However, accelerating GEMM has significantly shifted the Amdahl's law's landscape for ML inference; due to the decreased GEMM execution time, the relative execution time of non-GEMM operators is now significant. Although the importance of non-GEMM performance is increasing, we have little knowledge about the non-GEMM performance horizon in the latest hardware platforms and models. Therefore, to guide non-GEMM-oriented optimizations, we conduct a thorough performance analysis of 17 widely adopted ML models in Hugging Face and Torchvision on workstation and data center platforms with/without GPUs. We discover that non-GEMM performance bottleneck is a considerable issue across all the platforms and models, accounting for 11.3% to 73.6% of total latency, on average. The challenge significantly aggravates when we apply quantization, which is a common model compression technique, due to the boosted GEMM performance and extra non-GEMM operators for dequantization and requantization. To provide insights into non-GEMM optimization targets, we demystify the most dominant non-GEMM operators for each model and deployment software. We also show that widely adopted optimizations such as operator fusion do not completely address the non-GEMM performance bottleneck, where non-GEMM operators still account for 15% to 48% of total latency.

<title>DelGrad: Exact event-based gradients for training delays and weights on spiking neuromorphic hardware</title>

arXiv:2404.19165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently rely on the timing of signals for representing and processing information. Incorporating trainable transmission delays, alongside synaptic weights, is crucial for shaping these temporal dynamics. While recent methods have shown the benefits of training delays and weights in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency, they rely on discrete time, approximate gradients, and full access to internal variables like membrane potentials. This limits their precision, efficiency, and suitability for neuromorphic hardware due to increased memory requirements and I/O bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, we propose DelGrad, an analytical, event-based method to compute exact loss gradients for both synaptic weights and delays. The inclusion of delays in the training process emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Moreover, DelGrad, grounded purely in spike timing, eliminates the need to track additional variables such as membrane potentials. To showcase this key advantage, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of DelGrad on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform, by training SNNs in a chip-in-the-loop fashion. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the memory efficiency and accuracy benefits of adding delays to SNNs on noisy mixed-signal hardware. Additionally, these experiments also reveal the potential of delays for stabilizing networks against noise. DelGrad opens a new way for training SNNs with delays on neuromorphic hardware, which results in fewer required parameters, higher accuracy and ease of hardware training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method of finding reasoning pathways in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) method improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing exact goodness-of-fit tests for discrete exponential family models. This classical problem remains practically unsolved for many types of structured or sparse data, as it rests on a computationally difficult core task: to produce a reliable sample from lattice points in a high-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision process and demonstrate a reinforcement learning approach for learning `good moves' for sampling. We illustrate the approach on data sets and models for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly due to problem size, sparsity structure, and the requirement to use prohibitive non-linear algebra computations in the process. The differentiating factor is the use of scalable tools from \emph{linear} algebra in the context of theoretical guarantees provided by \emph{non-linear} algebra. Our algorithm is based on an actor-critic sampling scheme, with provable convergence.
  The discovered moves can be used to efficiently obtain an exchangeable sample, significantly cutting computational times with regards to statistical testing.

Abstract: Deep neural network training often involves stochastic optimization, meaning each run will produce a different model. This implies that hyperparameters of the training process, such as the random seed itself, can potentially have significant influence on the variability in the trained models. Measuring model quality by summary statistics, such as test accuracy, can obscure this dependence. We propose a robust hypothesis testing framework and a novel summary statistic, the $\alpha$-trimming level, to measure model similarity. Applying hypothesis testing directly with the $\alpha$-trimming level is challenging because we cannot accurately describe the distribution under the null hypothesis. Our framework addresses this issue by determining how closely an approximate distribution resembles the expected distribution of a group of individually trained models and using this approximation as our reference. We then use the $\alpha$-trimming level to suggest how many training runs should be sampled to ensure that an ensemble is a reliable representative of the true model performance. We also show how to use the $\alpha$-trimming level to measure model variability and demonstrate experimentally that it is more expressive than performance metrics like validation accuracy, churn, or expected calibration error when taken alone. An application of fine-tuning over random seed in transfer learning illustrates the advantage of our new metric.

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in visual-language reasoning across diverse cross-modal benchmarks. Despite these advances, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, underachieve compared to well-trained smaller models, such as BERT, in Fake News Detection (FND), prompting inquiries into LVLMs' efficacy in FND tasks. Although performance could improve through fine-tuning LVLMs, the substantial parameters and requisite pre-trained weights render it a resource-heavy endeavor for FND applications. This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model. Next, we integrate standard in-context learning (ICL) with LVLMs, noting improvements in FND performance, though limited in scope and consistency. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (IMFND) framework, enriching in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a well-trained smaller model. This strategic integration directs the LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the IMFND framework significantly boosts the FND efficiency of LVLMs, achieving enhanced accuracy over the standard ICL approach across three publicly available FND datasets.

Abstract: We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL: a developer can change one and the LLM automatically updates the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.

Abstract: Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is increasingly used for clinical and brain-computer interface applications due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. However, inter-subject variability in electrode implantation poses a challenge for developing generalized neural decoders. To address this, we introduce a novel decoder model that is robust to inter-subject electrode implantation variability. We call this model RISE-iEEG, which stands for Robust to Inter-Subject Electrode Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier. RISE-iEEG employs a deep neural network structure preceded by a participant-specific projection network. The projection network maps the neural data of individual participants onto a common low-dimensional space, compensating for the implantation variability. In other words, we developed an iEEG decoder model that can be applied across multiple participants' data without requiring the coordinates of electrode for each participant. The performance of RISE-iEEG across multiple datasets, including the Music Reconstruction dataset, and AJILE12 dataset, surpasses that of advanced iEEG decoder models such as HTNet and EEGNet. Our analysis shows that the performance of RISE-iEEG is about 7\% higher than that of HTNet and EEGNet in terms of F1 score, with an average F1 score of 0.83, which is the highest result among the evaluation methods defined. Furthermore, Our analysis of the projection network weights reveals that the Superior Temporal and Postcentral lobes are key encoding nodes for the Music Reconstruction and AJILE12 datasets, which aligns with the primary physiological principles governing these regions. This model improves decoding accuracy while maintaining interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: Fraud is a prevalent offence that extends beyond financial loss, causing psychological and physical harm to victims. The advancements in online communication technologies alowed for online fraud to thrive in this vast network, with fraudsters increasingly using these channels for deception. With the progression of technologies like AI, there is a growing concern that fraud will scale up, using sophisticated methods, like deep-fakes in phishing campaigns, all generated by language generation models like ChatGPT. However, the application of AI in detecting and analyzing online fraud remains understudied. We conduct a Systematic Literature Review on AI and NLP techniques for online fraud detection. The review adhered the PRISMA-ScR protocol, with eligibility criteria including relevance to online fraud, use of text data, and AI methodologies. We screened 2,457 academic records, 350 met our eligibility criteria, and included 223. We report the state-of-the-art NLP techniques for analysing various online fraud categories; the training data sources; the NLP algorithms and models built; and the performance metrics employed for model evaluation. We find that current research on online fraud is divided into various scam activitiesand identify 16 different frauds that researchers focus on. This SLR enhances the academic understanding of AI-based detection methods for online fraud and offers insights for policymakers, law enforcement, and businesses on safeguarding against such activities. We conclude that focusing on specific scams lacks generalization, as multiple models are required for different fraud types. The evolving nature of scams limits the effectiveness of models trained on outdated data. We also identify issues in data limitations, training bias reporting, and selective presentation of metrics in model performance reporting, which can lead to potential biases in model evaluation.

Abstract: Shuffled linear regression (SLR) seeks to estimate latent features through a linear transformation, complicated by unknown permutations in the measurement dimensions. This problem extends traditional least-squares (LS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches by jointly estimating the permutation, resulting in shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO formulations. Existing methods, constrained by the combinatorial complexity of permutation recovery, often address small-scale cases with limited measurements. In contrast, we focus on large-scale SLR, particularly suited for environments with abundant measurement samples. We propose a spectral matching method that efficiently resolves permutations by aligning spectral components of the measurement and feature covariances. Rigorous theoretical analyses demonstrate that our method achieves accurate estimates in both shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO settings, given a sufficient number of samples. Furthermore, we extend our approach to address simultaneous pose and correspondence estimation in image registration tasks. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world image registration scenarios show that our method outperforms existing algorithms in both estimation accuracy and registration performance.

Abstract: RF-GAP has recently been introduced as an improved random forest proximity measure. In this paper, we present PF-GAP, an extension of RF-GAP proximities to proximity forests, an accurate and efficient time series classification model. We use the forest proximities in connection with Multi-Dimensional Scaling to obtain vector embeddings of univariate time series, comparing the embeddings to those obtained using various time series distance measures. We also use the forest proximities alongside Local Outlier Factors to investigate the connection between misclassified points and outliers, comparing with nearest neighbor classifiers which use time series distance measures. We show that the forest proximities seem to exhibit a stronger connection between misclassified points and outliers than nearest neighbor classifiers.

Abstract: At the same time that artificial intelligence is becoming popular, concern and the need for regulation is growing, including among other requirements the data privacy. In this context, Federated Learning is proposed as a solution to data privacy concerns derived from different source data scenarios due to its distributed learning. The defense mechanisms proposed in literature are just focused on defending against adversarial attacks and the performance, leaving aside other important qualities such as explainability, fairness to poor quality clients, dynamism in terms of attacks configuration and generality in terms of being resilient against different kinds of attacks. In this work, we propose RAB$^2$-DEF, a $\textbf{r}$esilient $\textbf{a}$gainst $\textbf{b}\text{yzantine}$ and $\textbf{b}$ackdoor attacks which is $\textbf{d}$ynamic, $\textbf{e}$xplainable and $\textbf{f}$air to poor clients using local linear explanations. We test the performance of RAB$^2$-DEF in image datasets and both byzantine and backdoor attacks considering the state-of-the-art defenses and achieve that RAB$^2$-DEF is a proper defense at the same time that it boosts the other qualities towards trustworthy artificial intelligence.

arXiv:2410.09080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that social determinants of health (SDoH), a set of nonmedical factors, affect individuals' risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Nevertheless, the etiological mechanisms underlying such relationships remain largely unclear, mainly due to difficulties in collecting relevant information. This study presents a novel, automated framework that leverages recent advancements of large language model (LLM) and natural language processing techniques to mine SDoH knowledge from extensive literature and integrate it with AD-related biological entities extracted from the general-purpose knowledge graph PrimeKG. Utilizing graph neural networks, we performed link prediction tasks to evaluate the resultant SDoH-augmented knowledge graph. Our framework shows promise for enhancing knowledge discovery in AD and can be generalized to other SDoH-related research areas, offering a new tool for exploring the impact of social determinants on health outcomes.

arXiv:2411.01639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models offer a promising framework for robotic perception and planning by processing sensory inputs to generate actionable plans. However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans.
  To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement, which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems. Fine-tuned models, code, and datasets are available at https://uncertainty-in-planning.github.io/.

<title>Bridging the Visual Gap: Fine-Tuning Multimodal Models with Knowledge-Adapted Captions</title>

arXiv:2411.09018v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.

arXiv:2412.09557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel methods map data into high-dimensional spaces, enabling linear algorithms to learn nonlinear functions without explicitly storing the feature vectors. Quantum kernel methods promise efficient learning by encoding feature maps into exponentially large Hilbert spaces inherent in quantum systems. In this work, we implement quantum kernels on a 10-qubit star-topology register in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. We experimentally encode classical data in the evolution of multiple quantum coherence orders using data-dependent unitary transformations and then demonstrate one-dimensional regression and two-dimensional classification tasks. By extending the register to a double-layered star configuration, we propose an extended quantum kernel to handle non-parametrized operator inputs. Specifically, we set up a kernel for the classification of entangling and non-entangling operations and then validate this kernel first numerically by computing it on a double-layered star register and then experimentally by computing it on a three-qubit NMR register. Our results show that this kernel exhibits an ability to generalize well over unseen data. These results confirm that quantum kernels possess strong capabilities in classical as well as quantum machine learning tasks.

Abstract: This work quantifies the risk of training data leakage from LLMs (Large Language Models) using sequence-level probabilities. Computing extraction probabilities for individual sequences provides finer-grained information than has been studied in prior benchmarking work. We re-analyze the effects of decoding schemes, model sizes, prefix lengths, partial sequence leakages, and token positions to uncover new insights that were not possible in previous works due to their choice of metrics. We perform this study on two pre-trained models, Llama and OPT, trained on the Common Crawl and The Pile respectively. We discover that 1) Extraction Rate, the predominant metric used in prior quantification work, underestimates the threat of leakage of training data in randomized LLMs by as much as 2.14X. 2) Although on average, larger models and longer prefixes can extract more data, this is not true for a substantial portion of individual sequences. 30.4-41.5% of our sequences are easier to extract with either shorter prefixes or smaller models. 3) Contrary to previous beliefs, partial leakage in commonly used decoding schemes like top-k and top-p is not easier than leaking verbatim training data. The aim of this work is to encourage the adoption of this metric for future work on quantification of training data extraction.

Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.

Abstract: With the advent of large multimodal language models, science is now at a threshold of an AI-based technological transformation. Recently, a plethora of new AI models and tools has been proposed, promising to empower researchers and academics worldwide to conduct their research more effectively and efficiently. This includes all aspects of the research cycle, especially (1) searching for relevant literature; (2) generating research ideas and conducting experimentation; generating (3) text-based and (4) multimodal content (e.g., scientific figures and diagrams); and (5) AI-based automatic peer review. In this survey, we provide an in-depth overview over these exciting recent developments, which promise to fundamentally alter the scientific research process for good. Our survey covers the five aspects outlined above, indicating relevant datasets, methods and results (including evaluation) as well as limitations and scope for future research. Ethical concerns regarding shortcomings of these tools and potential for misuse (fake science, plagiarism, harms to research integrity) take a particularly prominent place in our discussion. We hope that our survey will not only become a reference guide for newcomers to the field but also a catalyst for new AI-based initiatives in the area of "AI4Science".

Abstract: Multiple agents -- including humans and AI models -- are often paired on decision tasks with the expectation of achieving complementary performance, where the combined performance of both agents outperforms either one alone. However, knowing how to improve the performance of a human-AI team is often difficult without knowing more about what particular information and strategies each agent employs. We provide a decision-theoretic framework for characterizing the value of information -- and consequently, opportunities for agents to better exploit available information -- in AI-assisted decision workflows. We demonstrate the use of the framework for model selection, empirical evaluation of human-AI performance, and explanation design. We propose a novel information-based explanation technique that adapts SHAP, a saliency-based explanation, to explain information value in decision making.

arXiv:2502.06817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MedSAM, a medical foundation model derived from the SAM architecture, has demonstrated notable success across diverse medical domains. However, its clinical application faces two major challenges: the dependency on labor-intensive manual prompt generation, which imposes a significant burden on clinicians, and the absence of semantic labeling in the generated segmentation masks for organs or lesions, limiting its practicality for non-expert users. To address these limitations, we propose AutoMedSAM, an end-to-end framework derived from SAM, designed to enhance usability and segmentation performance. AutoMedSAM retains MedSAM's image encoder and mask decoder structure while introducing a novel diffusion-based class prompt encoder. The diffusion-based encoder employs a dual-decoder structure to collaboratively generate prompt embeddings guided by sparse and dense prompt definitions. These embeddings enhance the model's ability to understand and process clinical imagery autonomously. With this encoder, AutoMedSAM leverages class prompts to embed semantic information into the model's predictions, transforming MedSAM's semi-automated pipeline into a fully automated workflow. Furthermore, AutoMedSAM employs an uncertainty-aware joint optimization strategy during training to effectively inherit MedSAM's pre-trained knowledge while improving generalization by integrating multiple loss functions. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate that AutoMedSAM achieves superior performance while broadening its applicability to both clinical settings and non-expert users. Code is available at https://github.com/HP-ML/AutoPromptMedSAM.git.

Abstract: We derived the closed-form asymptotic optimism of linear regression models under random designs, and generalizes it to kernel ridge regression. Using scaled asymptotic optimism as a generic predictive model complexity measure, we studied the fundamental different behaviors of linear regression model, tangent kernel (NTK) regression model and three-layer fully connected neural networks (NN). Our contribution is two-fold: we provided theoretical ground for using scaled optimism as a model predictive complexity measure; and we show empirically that NN with ReLUs behaves differently from kernel models under this measure. With resampling techniques, we can also compute the optimism for regression models with real data.

Abstract: Quantum kernels (QK) are widely used in quantum machine learning applications; yet, their potential to surpass classical machine learning methods on classical datasets remains uncertain. This limitation can be attributed to the exponential concentration phenomenon, which can impair both trainability and generalization. A common strategy to alleviate this is bandwidth tuning, which involves rescaling data points in the quantum model to improve generalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that optimal bandwidth tuning results in QKs that closely resemble radial basis function (RBF) kernels, leading to a lack of quantum advantage over classical methods. Moreover, we reveal that the size of optimal bandwidth tuning parameters further simplifies QKs, causing them to behave like polynomial kernels, corresponding to a low-order Taylor approximation of a RBF kernel. We thoroughly investigate this for fidelity quantum kernels and projected quantum kernels using various data encoding circuits across several classification datasets. We provide numerical evidence and derive a simple analytical model that elucidates how bandwidth tuning influences key quantities in classification tasks. Overall, our findings shed light on the mechanisms that render QK methods classically simulatable.

Abstract: Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness, efficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.

Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: In order to reduce the cost of experimental evaluation for models, we introduce a computational theory of evaluation for prediction and decision models: build evaluation model to accelerate the evaluation procedures. We prove upper bounds of generalized error and generalized causal effect error of given evaluation models. We also prove efficiency, and consistency to estimated causal effect from deployed subject to evaluation metric by prediction. To learn evaluation models, we propose a meta-learner to handle heterogeneous evaluation subjects space problem. Comparing with existed evaluation approaches, our (conditional) evaluation model reduced 24.1\%-99.0\% evaluation errors across 12 scenes, including individual medicine, scientific simulation, social experiment, business activity, and quantum trade. The evaluation time is reduced 3-7 order of magnitude comparing with experiments or simulations.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely adopted, non-invasive technique for monitoring cardiovascular health and physiological parameters in both consumer and clinical settings. While motion artifacts in dynamic environments have been extensively studied, suboptimal skin-sensor contact in sedentary conditions - a critical yet underexplored issue - can distort PPG waveform morphology, leading to the loss or misalignment of key features and compromising sensing accuracy. In this work, we propose CP-PPG, a novel framework that transforms Contact Pressure-distorted PPG signals into high-fidelity waveforms with ideal morphology. CP-PPG integrates a custom data collection protocol, a carefully designed signal processing pipeline, and a novel deep adversarial model trained with a custom PPG-aware loss function. We validated CP-PPG through comprehensive evaluations, including 1) morphology transformation performance on our self-collected dataset, 2) downstream physiological monitoring performance on public datasets, and 3) in-the-wild study. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial and consistent improvements in signal fidelity (Mean Absolute Error: 0.09, 40% improvement over the original signal) as well as downstream performance across all evaluations in Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Respiration Rate (RR), and Blood Pressure (BP) estimation (on average, 21% improvement in HR; 41-46% in HRV; 6% in RR; and 4-5% in BP). These findings highlight the critical importance of addressing skin-sensor contact issues to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of PPG-based physiological monitoring. CP-PPG thus holds significant potential to improve the accuracy of wearable health technologies in clinical and consumer applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, with their performance heavily dependent on the quality of input prompts. While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on manual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This paper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a novel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm principles to evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic approaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO integrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its evolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets including ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important point for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods: importance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of generations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of different LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically generate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into the relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their evolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in improving LLM performance.

<title>Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems</title>

Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.

<title>Understanding and Optimizing Multi-Stage AI Inference Pipelines</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.
  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

<title>LLM Unlearning Reveals a Stronger-Than-Expected Coreset Effect in Current Benchmarks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10185</link>

arXiv:2504.10185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/MU-Coreset.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) show remarkable performance in visual reasoning tasks, successfully tackling college-level challenges that require high-level understanding of images. However, some recent reports of VLMs struggling to reason about elemental visual concepts like orientation, position, continuity, and occlusion suggest a potential gulf between human and VLM vision. Here we use the toolkit of neuropsychology to systematically assess the capabilities of three state-of-the-art VLMs across visual domains. Using 51 tests drawn from six clinical and experimental batteries, we characterise the visual abilities of leading VLMs relative to normative performance in healthy adults. While the models excel in straightforward object recognition tasks, we find widespread deficits in low- and mid-level visual abilities that would be considered clinically significant in humans. These selective deficits, profiled through validated test batteries, suggest that an artificial system can achieve complex object recognition without developing foundational visual concepts that in humans require no explicit training.

<title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Regret Optimization</title>

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) is a popular framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but its adversarial nature can lead to overly conservative solutions. To address this, we study ex-ante Distributionally Robust Regret Optimization (DRRO), focusing on Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets which are popular due to their links to regularization and machine learning. We provide a systematic analysis of Wasserstein DRRO, paralleling known results for Wasserstein DRO. Under smoothness and regularity conditions, we show that Wasserstein DRRO coincides with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) up to first-order terms, and exactly so in convex quadratic settings. We revisit the Wasserstein DRRO newsvendor problem, where the loss is the maximum of two linear functions of demand and decision. Extending [25], we show that the regret can be computed by maximizing two one-dimensional concave functions. For more general loss functions involving the maximum of multiple linear terms in multivariate random variables and decision vectors, we prove that computing the regret and thus also the DRRO policy is NP-hard. We then propose a convex relaxation for these more general Wasserstein DRRO problems and demonstrate its strong empirical performance. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the optimality gap of our relaxation and show it improves over recent alternatives.

<title>Bypassing Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Detection in LLM Guardrails</title>

arXiv:2504.11168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) guardrail systems are designed to protect against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.

<title>A Real-time Anomaly Detection Method for Robots based on a Flexible and Sparse Latent Space</title>

arXiv:2504.11170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for robots to operate effectively in diverse environments necessitates the need for robust real-time anomaly detection techniques during robotic operations. However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoders model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments. The code will be made publicly available after acceptance.

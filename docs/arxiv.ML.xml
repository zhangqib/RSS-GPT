Summary: 
The article introduces OPEN, a Comprehensive and Prerequisite-free Explainer for GNNs, addressing limitations in current XGNN methods. OPEN can capture the complete decision logic of GNNs across diverse dataset distributions without strict prerequisites. It partitions the dataset into different environments, each with distinct graph distributions, and learns GNN decision logic by analyzing predictions on sampled subgraphs. Experimental results show that OPEN outperforms existing methods in fidelity, efficiency, and robustness in real-world scenarios. This novel approach enhances the transparency and reliability of GNNs while providing valuable insights into their decision-making processes. <div>

Abstract: To enhance the reliability and credibility of graph neural networks (GNNs) and improve the transparency of their decision logic, a new field of explainability of GNNs (XGNN) has emerged. However, two major limitations severely degrade the performance and hinder the generalizability of existing XGNN methods: they (a) fail to capture the complete decision logic of GNNs across diverse distributions in the entire dataset's sample space, and (b) impose strict prerequisites on edge properties and GNN internal accessibility. To address these limitations, we propose OPEN, a novel c\textbf{O}mprehensive and \textbf{P}rerequisite-free \textbf{E}xplainer for G\textbf{N}Ns. OPEN, as the first work in the literature, can infer and partition the entire dataset's sample space into multiple environments, each containing graphs that follow a distinct distribution. OPEN further learns the decision logic of GNNs across different distributions by sampling subgraphs from each environment and analyzing their predictions, thus eliminating the need for strict prerequisites. Experimental results demonstrate that OPEN captures nearly complete decision logic of GNNs, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity while maintaining similar efficiency, and enhances robustness in real-world scenarios.

<div> physics-guided deep learning, weather forecasting, numerical weather prediction, deep learning models, PhyDL-NWP

Summary:
PhyDL-NWP is a framework that combines physical equations with deep learning to improve weather forecasting. It addresses the computational inefficiency and lack of physical completeness in traditional methods by integrating physical laws into data-driven models. This approach allows for the prediction of weather variables at any spatiotemporal location, while also computing physical terms through automatic differentiation. By using a physics-informed loss function, PhyDL-NWP ensures that predictions align with governing dynamics, improving both forecasting performance and physical consistency. The framework enables resolution-free downscaling by modeling weather as a continuous function and fine-tuning pre-trained models with minimal overhead. It achieves significantly faster inference speeds and requires fewer parameters, making it an efficient and accurate tool for weather forecasting. <div>

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential but remains computationally intensive and physically incomplete in traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods. Deep learning (DL) models offer efficiency and accuracy but often ignore physical laws, limiting interpretability and generalization. We propose PhyDL-NWP, a physics-guided deep learning framework that integrates physical equations with latent force parameterization into data-driven models. It predicts weather variables from arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates, computes physical terms via automatic differentiation, and uses a physics-informed loss to align predictions with governing dynamics. PhyDL-NWP enables resolution-free downscaling by modeling weather as a continuous function and fine-tunes pre-trained models with minimal overhead, achieving up to 170x faster inference with only 55K parameters. Experiments show that PhyDL-NWP improves both forecasting performance and physical consistency.

<div> framework, analysis, convergence, regularization, data distribution<br>
Summary:<br>
Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) aim to sample from a target distribution by learning score functions using samples perturbed by Gaussian noise. Existing convergence bounds for SGMs in the $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance rely on stringent assumptions about the data distribution. In this work, a novel framework for analyzing $\mathcal{W}_2$-convergence in SGMs is presented, relaxing traditional assumptions such as log-concavity and score regularity. The regularization properties of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process are leveraged to show that weak log-concavity of the data distribution evolves into log-concavity over time. This transition is rigorously quantified through a PDE-based analysis of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. It is established that the drift of the time-reversed OU process alternates between contractive and non-contractive regimes, reflecting the dynamics of concavity. This approach avoids stringent regularity conditions on the score function and its estimators, relying on more practical assumptions. The framework's applicability is demonstrated through computations on Gaussian mixture models, showcasing its versatility and potential for broader data distribution classes.<br> <div>

Moreover, we establish that the drift of the time-reversed OU process alternates between contractive and non-contractive regimes, reflecting the dynamics of concavity. Our approach circumvents the need for stringent regularity conditions on the score function and its estimators, relying instead on milder, more practical assumptions. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this framework through explicit computations on Gaussian mixture models, illustrating its versatility and potential for broader classes of data distributions.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) with constrained action spaces to solve combinatorial optimization problems, specifically focusing on the normalized cut problem. By utilizing a Wedge and Ring Transformer in the context of transportation networks, the RL solution aims to guide graph partitions towards predefined template instances, such as Wedges and Rings, leading to partitions closer to optimal solutions. This approach demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge into RL algorithms to improve solution outcomes in specific domains. The proposed method can be generalized to other problem domains, highlighting the versatility and effectiveness of incorporating domain-specific constraints in RL-based combinatorial optimization. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an important paradigm to solve combinatorial optimization problems primarily due to its ability to learn heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating external knowledge that will steer combinatorial optimization problem solutions towards domain appropriate outcomes remains an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we propose the first RL solution that uses constrained action spaces to guide the normalized cut problem towards pre-defined template instances. Using transportation networks as an example domain, we create a Wedge and Ring Transformer that results in graph partitions that are shaped in form of Wedges and Rings and which are likely to be closer to natural optimal partitions. However, our approach is general as it is based on principles that can be generalized to other domains.

arXiv:2505.14238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank. Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely. This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/abba.

arXiv:2505.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language tasks, and recent efforts have sought to extend their capabilities to multimodal domains and resource-constrained environments. However, existing approaches often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning or assume fixed training conditions, limiting their generalization when facing unseen modalities, limited data, or restricted compute resources. This dissertation presents a systematic study toward generalizing LLM usability under real-world constraints. First, it introduces a robust text-centric alignment framework that enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate diverse modalities-including text, images, tables, and any modalities - via natural language interfaces. This approach supports in-context adaptation to unseen or dynamically changing modalities without requiring retraining. To enhance robustness against noisy and missing modalities, an adversarial prompting technique is proposed, generating semantically challenging perturbations at the prompt level to stress-test model reliability. Beyond multimodal setting, the dissertation investigates inference-time optimization strategies for LLMs, leveraging prompt search and uncertainty quantification to improve performance without additional model training. This perspective offers an efficient alternative to scaling model parameters or retraining from scratch. Additionally, the work addresses low-resource domains such as Verilog code generation by designing correct-by-construction synthetic data pipelines and logic-enhanced reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data. Together, these contributions form a unified effort to enhance the adaptability, scalability, and efficiency of large language models under practical constraints.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, compression, reinforcement learning, adaptive pruning, runtime memory

Summary:
- Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but computationally intensive, hindering deployment.
- Existing compression methods for LLMs often fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands.
- RAP is a dynamic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that adjusts compression strategies based on immediate memory constraints and workload demands.
- RAP tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache during execution, focusing on retaining components that maximize utility within the current memory budget.
- Experimental results show that RAP surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by dynamically considering both model weights and KV-cache in real-time. 

<br /><br />Summary: 

Large language models have significant computational and memory requirements that limit their deployment. Current compression methods for these models struggle to adapt to changing memory conditions and diverse user requests. To address these limitations, RAP, a novel framework driven by reinforcement learning, dynamically adjusts compression strategies based on real-time memory constraints and workload demands. By tracking the ratio between model parameters and KV-cache and retaining components that maximize utility within current memory limits, RAP outperforms existing methods by considering both model weights and KV-cache dynamically. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

Summary: 
MetaSTH-Sleep is introduced as a few-shot sleep stage classification framework using spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. This approach addresses challenges faced in accurate classification of sleep stages such as limited annotated data, inter-individual variability, and neglect of high-order signal relationships. By enabling rapid adaptation to new subjects with minimal labeled samples, MetaSTH-Sleep improves model performance and generalization. The use of hypergraph structure effectively captures spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics in EEG signals, enhancing the understanding of signal heterogeneity. Experimental results showcase significant performance enhancements across diverse subjects, providing valuable insights for clinicians in sleep stage annotation. <div>
arXiv:2505.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages based on bio-signals is fundamental for automatic sleep stage annotation. Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.

Summary:
The article introduces a hierarchical method for variational inference for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs), inspired by control theory. By decomposing the control term into linear and non-linear components, the authors derive an optimal control term for linear SDEs using stochastic optimal control. The non-linear component is modeled by a neural network, allowing for efficient training of neural SDEs without sacrificing expressive power. Training is initialized at a lower cost since the linear part of the control term is optimal and does not need to be learned. This approach leads to faster convergence in training neural SDEs, making uncertainty-aware reasoning in time-series more computationally feasible. <div>

Abstract: We present a hierarchical, control theory inspired method for variational inference (VI) for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). While VI for neural SDEs is a promising avenue for uncertainty-aware reasoning in time-series, it is computationally challenging due to the iterative nature of maximizing the ELBO. In this work, we propose to decompose the control term into linear and residual non-linear components and derive an optimal control term for linear SDEs, using stochastic optimal control. Modeling the non-linear component by a neural network, we show how to efficiently train neural SDEs without sacrificing their expressive power. Since the linear part of the control term is optimal and does not need to be learned, the training is initialized at a lower cost and we observe faster convergence.

Summary:
TrimR is a new framework designed to improve the efficiency of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by dynamically compressing their Chain-of-Thought reasoning process. LRMs often generate redundant thinking processes, leading to inefficiencies during inference. TrimR uses a pre-trained verifier to detect and truncate these redundant thoughts without the need for fine-tuning. The framework is specifically engineered for production-level deployment and has been shown to enhance test-time scaling and inference efficiency on various benchmarks. Empirical evaluations on different LRMs demonstrate up to a 70% improvement in reasoning runtime without sacrificing accuracy. TrimR offers a solution to the decoding overhead incurred by LRMs using test-time scaling methods, making it suitable for high-throughput industrial applications. <div>
arXiv:2505.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries, but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained, instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on accuracy.

Summary:  
OCR-Reasoning is a new benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on text-rich image reasoning tasks. It consists of 1,069 human-annotated examples covering 6 core reasoning abilities and 18 practical reasoning tasks.

Evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark revealed significant challenges, with none achieving accuracy above 50%. This highlights the urgent need to address the difficulties in text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are publicly available, providing a valuable resource for researchers in this field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal slow-thinking systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse visual reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in text-rich image reasoning tasks remain understudied due to the lack of a systematic benchmark. To address this gap, we propose OCR-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess Multimodal Large Language Models on text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark comprises 1,069 human-annotated examples spanning 6 core reasoning abilities and 18 practical reasoning tasks in text-rich visual scenarios. Furthermore, unlike other text-rich image understanding benchmarks that only annotate the final answers, OCR-Reasoning also annotates the reasoning process simultaneously. With the annotated reasoning process and the final answers, OCR-Reasoning evaluates not only the final answers generated by models but also their reasoning processes, enabling a holistic analysis of their problem-solving abilities. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our results demonstrate the limitations of existing methodologies. Notably, even state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit substantial difficulties, with none achieving accuracy surpassing 50\% across OCR-Reasoning, indicating that the challenges of text-rich image reasoning are an urgent issue to be addressed.

<div> Keywords: Dynamic programming, Tropical attention, Neural Algorithmic Reasoning, Max-plus semiring, Adversarial attacks

Summary:
Dynamic programming algorithms for optimization problems typically use max-plus semirings for value functions, but existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning models rely on softmax attention, which can blur sharp polyhedral structures. This paper introduces Tropical attention, a new attention function operating in the max-plus semiring, improving reasoning in out-of-distribution settings. Tropical attention approximates tropical circuits of DP-type algorithms and enhances OOD performance in algorithmic reasoning tasks. It surpasses softmax baselines in length and value generalization while remaining stable under adversarial attacks. The study also introduces adversarial-attack generalization as a benchmark for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning. Tropical attention restores sharp, scale-invariant reasoning that softmax lacks, improving performance and stability in challenging scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems work with taking maximization, minimization, and classical addition in their recursion algorithms. The associated value functions correspond to convex polyhedra in the max plus semiring. Existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning models, however, rely on softmax-normalized dot-product attention where the smooth exponential weighting blurs these sharp polyhedral structures and collapses when evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We introduce Tropical attention, a novel attention function that operates natively in the max-plus semiring of tropical geometry. We prove that Tropical attention can approximate tropical circuits of DP-type combinatorial algorithms. We then propose that using Tropical transformers enhances empirical OOD performance in both length generalization and value generalization, on algorithmic reasoning tasks, surpassing softmax baselines while remaining stable under adversarial attacks. We also present adversarial-attack generalization as a third axis for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that Tropical attention restores the sharp, scale-invariant reasoning absent from softmax.

<div> Keywords: language models, safety risks, dynamic shaping, guardrail models, safety assessment

Summary:
Finetuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to safety risks as even a few harmful examples can compromise alignment. To address this issue, the authors propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS) as a framework that fine-tunes models by reinforcing learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content, instead of treating all parts equally. They introduce the idea of guardrail models being repurposed to evaluate partial responses, enabling the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR) for token-level signals to operate dynamically during training. STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, effectively mitigates risks without sacrificing task performance across various threats and datasets. The research encourages future safety efforts to adopt dynamic shaping principles for enhanced mitigation against evolving finetuning risks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping. In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence. Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising capability on intended tasks.

Summary: 
LengthLogD is a novel predictive framework designed to accurately predict the logD of peptide compounds, considering the impact of molecular weight and length on membrane permeability. This framework utilizes multi-scale molecular representations and employs a length-stratified strategy, along with an adaptive weight allocation mechanism for long peptides. Experimental results show superior performance in predicting logD values for short, medium, and long peptides, with a notable reduction in prediction errors for long peptides. The study highlights the significance of topological features and the effectiveness of the length-stratified approach, contributing to the overall improvement in predictive accuracy. Compared to existing models, LengthLogD offers precise logD predictions for peptide drug development, particularly showcasing its value in optimizing long peptide lead compounds. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Peptide compounds demonstrate considerable potential as therapeutic agents due to their high target affinity and low toxicity, yet their drug development is constrained by their low membrane permeability. Molecular weight and peptide length have significant effects on the logD of peptides, which in turn influences their ability to cross biological membranes. However, accurate prediction of peptide logD remains challenging due to the complex interplay between sequence, structure, and ionization states. This study introduces LengthLogD, a predictive framework that establishes specialized models through molecular length stratification while innovatively integrating multi-scale molecular representations. We constructed feature spaces across three hierarchical levels: atomic (10 molecular descriptors), structural (1024-bit Morgan fingerprints), and topological (3 graph-based features including Wiener index), optimized through stratified ensemble learning. An adaptive weight allocation mechanism specifically developed for long peptides significantly enhances model generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across all categories: short peptides (R^2=0.855), medium peptides (R^2=0.816), and long peptides (R^2=0.882), with a 34.7% reduction in prediction error for long peptides compared to conventional single-model approaches. Ablation studies confirm: 1) The length-stratified strategy contributes 41.2% to performance improvement; 2) Topological features account for 28.5% of predictive importance. Compared to state-of-the-art models, our method maintains short peptide prediction accuracy while achieving a 25.7% increase in the coefficient of determination (R^2) for long peptides. This research provides a precise logD prediction tool for peptide drug development, particularly demonstrating unique value in optimizing long peptide lead compounds.

<br />
Summary: 
Average-rKrum (ArKrum) is introduced as a novel aggregation strategy to enhance the resilience and privacy guarantees of Federated Learning (FL) systems against Byzantine attacks from malicious participants. It incorporates a median-based filtering mechanism to remove outliers and estimate the number of adversarial clients accurately. Additionally, ArKrum applies a multi-update averaging scheme to improve stability and performance, especially in cases where client data distributions differ. Evaluation on image and text datasets under various Byzantine attack types demonstrates that ArKrum consistently achieves high accuracy and stability, performing comparably or better than existing robust aggregation methods. These results highlight ArKrum as an effective and practical solution for securing FL systems in adversarial environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. It offers a promising approach to privacy-preserving AI. However, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial threats from malicious participants, referred to as Byzantine clients, who can send misleading updates to corrupt the global model. Traditional aggregation methods, such as simple averaging, are not robust to such attacks. More resilient approaches, like the Krum algorithm, require prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Average-rKrum (ArKrum), a novel aggregation strategy designed to enhance both the resilience and privacy guarantees of FL systems. Building on our previous work (rKrum), ArKrum introduces two key innovations. First, it includes a median-based filtering mechanism that removes extreme outliers before estimating the number of adversarial clients. Second, it applies a multi-update averaging scheme to improve stability and performance, particularly when client data distributions are not identical. We evaluate ArKrum on benchmark image and text datasets under three widely studied Byzantine attack types. Results show that ArKrum consistently achieves high accuracy and stability. It performs as well as or better than other robust aggregation methods. These findings demonstrate that ArKrum is an effective and practical solution for secure FL systems in adversarial environments.

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for foundation models rely heavily on fixed, manually curated benchmarks, limiting their ability to capture the full breadth of model capabilities. This paper introduces Active learning for Capability Evaluation (ACE), a novel framework for scalable, automated, and fine-grained evaluation of foundation models. ACE leverages the knowledge embedded in powerful language models to decompose a domain into semantically meaningful capabilities and generate diverse evaluation tasks, significantly reducing human effort. To maximize coverage and efficiency, ACE models a subject model's performance as a capability function over a latent semantic space and uses active learning to prioritize the evaluation of the most informative capabilities. This adaptive evaluation strategy enables cost-effective discovery of strengths, weaknesses, and failure modes that static benchmarks may miss. Our results suggest that ACE provides a more complete and informative picture of model capabilities, which is essential for safe and well-informed deployment of foundation models.

Abstract: Music auto-tagging is essential for organizing and discovering music in extensive digital libraries. While foundation models achieve exceptional performance in this domain, their outputs often lack interpretability, limiting trust and usability for researchers and end-users alike. In this work, we present an interpretable framework for music auto-tagging that leverages groups of musically meaningful multimodal features, derived from signal processing, deep learning, ontology engineering, and natural language processing. To enhance interpretability, we cluster features semantically and employ an expectation maximization algorithm, assigning distinct weights to each group based on its contribution to the tagging process. Our method achieves competitive tagging performance while offering a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, paving the way for more transparent and user-centric music tagging systems.

<br />
Summary: In the study, a novel method for enhancing large language models' (LLMs') accuracy in solving complex reasoning problems through extended computation time is proposed. By incorporating reward and risk/similarity signals into minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD), the framework offers improved robustness, accuracy, and well-defined asymptotic behavior compared to traditional methods. This approach also allows for a sample-efficient variant of MBRD that adjusts the number of generated samples based on problem difficulty. Empirical results on math and coding tasks show the advantages of the proposed method using open-source models, along with a comprehensive analysis of accuracy-compute trade-offs. The method's effectiveness lies in leveraging optimal policy concepts in KL-controlled reinforcement learning to enhance LLM performance in generating multiple candidate solutions and aggregating them effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference scaling can help LLMs solve complex reasoning problems through extended runtime computation. On top of targeted supervision for long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) generation, purely inference-time techniques such as best-of-N (BoN) sampling, majority voting, or more generally, minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD), can further improve LLM accuracy by generating multiple candidate solutions and aggregating over them. These methods typically leverage additional signals in the form of reward models and risk/similarity functions that compare generated samples, e.g., exact match in some normalized space or standard similarity metrics such as Rouge. Here we present a novel method for incorporating reward and risk/similarity signals into MBRD. Based on the concept of optimal policy in KL-controlled reinforcement learning, our framework provides a simple and well-defined mechanism for leveraging such signals, offering several advantages over traditional inference-time methods: higher robustness, improved accuracy, and well-understood asymptotic behavior. In addition, it allows for the development of a sample-efficient variant of MBRD that can adjust the number of samples to generate according to the difficulty of the problem, without relying on majority vote counts. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach on math (MATH-$500$) and coding (HumanEval) tasks using recent open-source models. We also present a comprehensive analysis of its accuracy-compute trade-offs.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Backdoor attacks, also known as trojans, are a concerning security risk in deep neural network models, especially in open-source or third-party models. This research focuses on in-distribution triggers in deep reinforcement learning agents, which are more dangerous as they can be easily activated within the natural data distribution. The study develops trojans in four RL environments and finds that in-distribution triggers, though requiring more effort to implement, are still viable threats in DRL through basic data poisoning attacks. This research sheds light on the potential vulnerabilities in DRL models and the importance of understanding and mitigating backdoor attacks. <div>
arXiv:2505.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks, or trojans, pose a security risk by concealing undesirable behavior in deep neural network models. Open-source neural networks are downloaded from the internet daily, possibly containing backdoors, and third-party model developers are common. To advance research on backdoor attack mitigation, we develop several trojans for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. We focus on in-distribution triggers, which occur within the agent's natural data distribution, since they pose a more significant security threat than out-of-distribution triggers due to their ease of activation by the attacker during model deployment. We implement backdoor attacks in four reinforcement learning (RL) environments: LavaWorld, Randomized LavaWorld, Colorful Memory, and Modified Safety Gymnasium. We train various models, both clean and backdoored, to characterize these attacks. We find that in-distribution triggers can require additional effort to implement and be more challenging for models to learn, but are nevertheless viable threats in DRL even using basic data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications requires the training of large numbers of models. This growing demand highlights the importance of training models without human supervision, while ensuring that their predictions are reliable. In response to this need, we propose a novel approach for determining model robustness.

arXiv:2505.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

Abstract: With the growing demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, improving their inference efficiency is crucial for sustainable and democratized access. However, retraining LLMs to meet new user-specific requirements is prohibitively expensive and environmentally unsustainable. In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative: composing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models. Our approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models by combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) layers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to efficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama achieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B training tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and an 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down to 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants, respectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot performance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA, X-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive or superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers, and vastly reduced KV cache memory. Notably, Zebra-Llama-8B surpasses Minitron-8B in few-shot accuracy by 7% while using 8x fewer training tokens, over 12x smaller KV cache, and a smaller teacher (8B vs. 15B). It also achieves 2.6x-3.8x higher throughput (tokens/s) than MambaInLlama up to a 32k context length. We will release code and model checkpoints upon acceptance.

This article introduces a new approach to the classic expert problem, focusing on achieving better comparator-adaptive $\Phi$-regret bounds with simpler algorithms compared to previous works. The proposed method involves a prior distribution over binary transformations, leading to prior-dependent regret against these transformations. Two efficient algorithms are presented, leveraging a prior-aware kernelized MWU algorithm and a BM-reduction approach. These methods offer improved regret bounds and simplicity in comparison to existing techniques. Additionally, the second algorithm can be extended to general-sum games, providing accelerated and adaptive convergence rates to $\Phi$-equilibria. In the context of correlated equilibria, the proposed bound surpasses existing results, showcasing the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classic expert problem, $\Phi$-regret measures the gap between the learner's total loss and that achieved by applying the best action transformation $\phi \in \Phi$. A recent work by Lu et al., [2025] introduces an adaptive algorithm whose regret against a comparator $\phi$ depends on a certain sparsity-based complexity measure of $\phi$, (almost) recovering and interpolating optimal bounds for standard regret notions such as external, internal, and swap regret. In this work, we propose a general idea to achieve an even better comparator-adaptive $\Phi$-regret bound via much simpler algorithms compared to Lu et al., [2025]. Specifically, we discover a prior distribution over all possible binary transformations and show that it suffices to achieve prior-dependent regret against these transformations. Then, we propose two concrete and efficient algorithms to achieve so, where the first one learns over multiple copies of a prior-aware variant of the Kernelized MWU algorithm of Farina et al., [2022], and the second one learns over multiple copies of a prior-aware variant of the BM-reduction [Blum and Mansour, 2007]. To further showcase the power of our methods and the advantages over Lu et al., [2025] besides the simplicity and better regret bounds, we also show that our second approach can be extended to the game setting to achieve accelerated and adaptive convergence rate to $\Phi$-equilibria for a class of general-sum games. When specified to the special case of correlated equilibria, our bound improves over the existing ones from Anagnostides et al., [2022a,b]

arXiv:2505.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token embeddings play a crucial role in language modeling but, despite this practical relevance, their theoretical understanding remains limited. Our paper addresses the gap by characterizing the structure of embeddings obtained via gradient descent. Specifically, we consider a one-layer softmax attention model with a linear head for binary classification, i.e., $\texttt{Softmax}( p^\top E_X^\top ) E_X v = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_i}) E_{x_i}^\top v}{\sum_{j=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_{j}}) }$, where $E_X = [ E_{x_1} , \dots, E_{x_T} ]^\top$ contains the embeddings of the input sequence, $p$ is the embedding of the $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ token and $v$ the output vector. First, we show that, already after a single step of gradient training with the logistic loss, the embeddings $E_X$ capture the importance of tokens in the dataset by aligning with the output vector $v$ proportionally to the frequency with which the corresponding tokens appear in the dataset. Then, after training $p$ via gradient flow until convergence, the softmax selects the important tokens in the sentence (i.e., those that are predictive of the label), and the resulting $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ embedding maximizes the margin for such a selection. Experiments on real-world datasets (IMDB, Yelp) exhibit a phenomenology close to that unveiled by our theory.

Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a crucial task in graph machine learning, addressing distribution shifts with model-centric techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches can struggle with severe shifts and limited computational resources. To overcome these challenges, GRADATE, a model-free framework, has been proposed. GRADATE selects optimal training data from the source domain for classification on the target domain, utilizing optimal transport theory to adapt to distribution changes. It is data-efficient, scalable, and complements existing model-centric GDA methods. Empirical studies on real-world graph-level datasets show that GRADATE outperforms other selection methods and improves off-the-shelf GDA methods with fewer training data. <div>

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a fundamental task in graph machine learning, with techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs) and specialized training procedures to tackle the distribution shift problem. Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA methods with much fewer training data.

<div> implicit regularization, gradient-based methods, second-order stationary points, strict saddle points, infinitesimally perturbed gradient descent

Summary:
This paper investigates implicit regularization in optimization problems, particularly in over-parameterized scenarios. It explores the conditions necessary for gradient-based methods to converge to second-order stationary points in a low-dimensional region of a smooth, possibly nonconvex function. Key to successful implicit regularization are the efficient escape from strict saddle points and maintaining proximity to the implicit region. The study introduces infinitesimally perturbed gradient descent (IPGD), incorporating small perturbations to escape strict saddle points while staying close to the implicit region. By applying this framework to over-parameterized matrix sensing, the paper establishes formal guarantees for implicit regularization behavior of IPGD. Extensive experiments validate these findings across various learning problems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit regularization refers to the phenomenon where local search algorithms converge to low-dimensional solutions, even when such structures are neither explicitly specified nor encoded in the optimization problem. While widely observed, this phenomenon remains theoretically underexplored, particularly in modern over-parameterized problems. In this paper, we study the conditions that enable implicit regularization by investigating when gradient-based methods converge to second-order stationary points (SOSPs) within an implicit low-dimensional region of a smooth, possibly nonconvex function. We show that successful implicit regularization hinges on two key conditions: $(i)$ the ability to efficiently escape strict saddle points, while $(ii)$ maintaining proximity to the implicit region. Existing analyses enabling the convergence of gradient descent (GD) to SOSPs often rely on injecting large perturbations to escape strict saddle points. However, this comes at the cost of deviating from the implicit region. The central premise of this paper is that it is possible to achieve the best of both worlds: efficiently escaping strict saddle points using infinitesimal perturbations, while controlling deviation from the implicit region via a small deviation rate. We show that infinitesimally perturbed gradient descent (IPGD), which can be interpreted as GD with inherent ``round-off errors'', can provably satisfy both conditions. We apply our framework to the problem of over-parameterized matrix sensing, where we establish formal guarantees for the implicit regularization behavior of IPGD. We further demonstrate through extensive experiments that these insights extend to a broader class of learning problems.

Abstract: This paper presents a Wavelet Probabilistic Recurrent Convolutional Network (WPRCN) for Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC), especially effective in handling non-stationary environments, data scarcity and noise perturbations. We introduce a versatile wavelet probabilistic module designed to extract and analyse the probabilistic features, which can seamlessly integrate with a variety of neural network architectures. This probabilistic module comprises an Adaptive Wavelet Probabilistic Feature Generator (AWPG) and a Channel Attention-based Probabilistic Temporal Convolutional Network (APTCN). Such formulation extends the application of wavelet probabilistic neural networks to deep neural networks for MTSC. The AWPG constructs an ensemble probabilistic model addressing different data scarcities and non-stationarity; it adaptively selects the optimal ones and generates probabilistic features for APTCN. The APTCN analyses the correlations of the features and forms a comprehensive feature space with existing MTSC models for classification. Here, we instantiate the proposed module to work in parallel with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Causal Fully Convolutional Network (C-FCN), demonstrating its broad applicability in time series analysis. The WPRCN is evaluated on 30 diverse MTS datasets and outperforms all the benchmark algorithms on average accuracy and rank, exhibiting pronounced strength in handling scarce data and physiological data subject to perturbations and non-stationarities.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces TI-DeepONet, a framework that combines neural operators with adaptive numerical time-stepping to improve accurate temporal extrapolation in dynamical systems modeling. By focusing on approximating instantaneous time-derivative fields and integrating them using numerical schemes, the approach supports continuous-time prediction and allows for the use of higher-precision integrators during inference. The TI(L)-DeepONet variant incorporates learnable coefficients for intermediate slopes to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluation on three PDEs shows that both TI-DeepONet and TI(L)-DeepONet outperform traditional methods, reducing relative L2 extrapolation errors by approximately 81% and 70%, respectively. Notably, the models maintain stability in predictions for temporal domains twice the training interval. This research bridges neural approximation and numerical analysis, offering a physics-aware learning paradigm for dynamical systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate temporal extrapolation presents a fundamental challenge for neural operators in modeling dynamical systems, where reliable predictions must extend significantly beyond the training time horizon. Conventional Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) approaches employ two inherently limited training paradigms - fixed-horizon rollouts that predict complete spatiotemporal solutions while disregarding temporal causality, and autoregressive formulations that accumulate errors through sequential predictions. We introduce TI-DeepONet, a framework that integrates neural operators with adaptive numerical time-stepping techniques to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical systems while mitigating error propagation in extended temporal forecasting. Our approach reformulates the learning objective from direct state prediction to the approximation of instantaneous time-derivative fields, which are then integrated using established numerical schemes. This architecture supports continuous-time prediction and enables deployment of higher-precision integrators during inference than those used during training, balancing computational efficiency with predictive accuracy. We further develop TI(L)-DeepONet, which incorporates learnable coefficients for intermediate slopes in the integration process, adapting to solution-specific variations and enhancing fidelity. Evaluation across three canonical PDEs shows that TI(L)-DeepONet marginally outperforms TI-DeepONet, with both reducing relative L2 extrapolation errors: approximately 81% over autoregressive and 70% over fixed-horizon methods. Notably, both maintain prediction stability for temporal domains extending to about twice the training interval. This research establishes a physics-aware operator learning paradigm that bridges neural approximation with numerical analysis while preserving the causal structure of dynamical systems.

Summary: 
The study introduces a new predictive model, the Multi-Head Attention Soft Random Forest (MHASRF), to address the issue of patient no-shows in healthcare settings. Patient no-shows can disrupt healthcare operations and resource allocation. The MHASRF model integrates attention mechanisms into a random forest model, allowing for soft splitting instead of hard decision splits. This enhances adaptability to specific patient behaviors. The model outperformed traditional models like decision trees, logistic regression, random forest, and naive Bayes with an accuracy of 93.56%. It also provides deeper insights into patient no-show predictors by identifying key features at both the tree and attention mechanism levels. The MHASRF model is robust, adaptable, and interpretable, offering healthcare providers a valuable tool to optimize resources and improve patient care.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unattended scheduled appointments, defined as patient no-shows, adversely affect both healthcare providers and patients' health, disrupting the continuity of care, operational efficiency, and the efficient allocation of medical resources. Accurate predictive modelling is needed to reduce the impact of no-shows. Although machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, random forest models, and decision trees, are widely used in predicting patient no-shows, they often rely on hard decision splits and static feature importance, limiting their adaptability to specific or complex patient behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose a new hybrid Multi-Head Attention Soft Random Forest (MHASRF) model that integrates attention mechanisms into a random forest model using probabilistic soft splitting instead of hard splitting. The MHASRF model assigns attention weights differently across the trees, enabling attention on specific patient behaviors. The model exhibited 93.56% accuracy, 93.67% precision, 93.56% recall, and a 93.59% F1 score, surpassing the performance of decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, and naive Bayes models. Furthermore, MHASRF was able to identify key predictors of patient no-shows using two levels of feature importance (tree level and attention mechanism level), offering deeper insights into patient no-show predictors. The proposed model is a robust, adaptable, and interpretable method for predicting patient no-shows that will help healthcare providers in optimizing resources.

Summary: 

The article introduces FLEX, a novel architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space instead of raw data, reducing velocity field variance and enhancing training stability. It combines a latent Transformer with a U-Net and convolutional ResNet layers, enabling capture of local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. FLEX leverages a task-specific encoder for improved spatio-temporal conditioning, incorporating weak conditioning for generalization and strong conditioning for reconstruction fidelity. It achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks with only two reverse diffusion steps and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluation on high-resolution 2D turbulence data demonstrates FLEX's superior performance over strong baselines, showcasing its generalization to out-of-distribution settings. <div>
arXiv:2505.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.

The reconstructed data distribution enables accurate training of dynamics models like ODEs and SDEs. CT-OT Flow outperforms other existing methods on synthetic benchmarks and achieves lower reconstruction errors on real datasets like scRNA-seq and typhoon-track datasets.

arXiv:2505.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, data are observed only as discrete-time snapshots spanning finite time intervals and subject to noisy timestamps, with no continuous trajectories available. Recovering the underlying continuous-time dynamics from these snapshots with coarse and noisy observation times is a critical and challenging task. We propose Continuous-Time Optimal Transport Flow (CT-OT Flow), which first infers high-resolution time labels via partial optimal transport and then reconstructs a continuous-time data distribution through a temporal kernel smoothing. This reconstruction enables accurate training of dynamics models such as ODEs and SDEs. CT-OT Flow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic benchmarks and achieves lower reconstruction errors on real scRNA-seq and typhoon-track datasets. Our results highlight the benefits of explicitly modeling temporal discretization and timestamp uncertainty, offering an accurate and general framework for bridging discrete snapshots and continuous-time processes.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of nonparametric regression in the presence of arbitrarily corrupted input data. The study focuses on the second-order Sobolev space, with two main contributions. Firstly, a minimax lower bound on estimation error is established, revealing an inherent limit for all estimators. Secondly, it is shown that the properly regularized smoothing spline estimator displays robustness against adversarial corruption, with its estimation error diminishing as the number of corrupted samples approaches zero. However, when a constant fraction of data is corrupted, no estimator can ensure vanishing estimation error, highlighting the effectiveness of the smoothing spline in tolerating a maximal number of corrupted samples. <div>
arXiv:2505.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of regression, a fundamental problem in machine learning, under the setting where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a subset of the input data. While the robustness of parametric regression has been extensively studied, its nonparametric counterpart remains largely unexplored. We characterize the adversarial robustness in nonparametric regression, assuming the regression function belongs to the second-order Sobolev space (i.e., it is square integrable up to its second derivative).
  The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) we establish a minimax lower bound on the estimation error, revealing a fundamental limit that no estimator can overcome, and (ii) we show that, perhaps surprisingly, the classical smoothing spline estimator, when properly regularized, exhibits robustness against adversarial corruption. These results imply that if $o(n)$ out of $n$ samples are corrupted, the estimation error of the smoothing spline vanishes as $n \to \infty$. On the other hand, when a constant fraction of the data is corrupted, no estimator can guarantee vanishing estimation error, implying the optimality of the smoothing spline in terms of maximum tolerable number of corrupted samples.

Summary:
In the realm of IoT-based botnet attack detection, researchers have been exploring different learning models, including traditional machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. One key development involves the use of attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, improving detection accuracy significantly. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a solution to the oversight of inter-instance relationships in most models by learning an embedding space through iterative message passing. To enhance classification performance, attention mechanisms have been incorporated within GNNs to leverage long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections. However, transforming high-dimensional IoT attack datasets into graph structures poses challenges due to the computational overhead. To address this, a framework is proposed in this paper that reduces the dimensionality of NetFlow-based IoT attack datasets before transforming them into graph datasets. Three dimension reduction techniques are evaluated--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder (AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and their impact on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection is compared.

Abstract: With the rise of IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various learning models for detection, including traditional machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. A key advancement involves deploying attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs, leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections. However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder (AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection

Summary:<br />
The article introduces VM2RL, a reinforcement learning system for virtual machine (VM) rescheduling in data centers. Existing VM rescheduling algorithms are hindered by long inference times due to dynamic VM state changes, impacting performance as data centers grow. VM2RL addresses this challenge with a two-stage framework accommodating diverse constraints and workload conditions. It includes a feature extraction module capturing relational information specific to rescheduling and a risk-seeking evaluation to optimize the trade-off between latency and accuracy. Extensive experiments with industry-scale data center data demonstrate that VM2RL can achieve performance comparable to the optimal solution in a matter of seconds. The code and datasets are open-sourced for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2505.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern industry-scale data centers need to manage a large number of virtual machines (VMs). Due to the continual creation and release of VMs, many small resource fragments are scattered across physical machines (PMs). To handle these fragments, data centers periodically reschedule some VMs to alternative PMs, a practice commonly referred to as VM rescheduling. Despite the increasing importance of VM rescheduling as data centers grow in size, the problem remains understudied. We first show that, unlike most combinatorial optimization tasks, the inference time of VM rescheduling algorithms significantly influences their performance, due to dynamic VM state changes during this period. This causes existing methods to scale poorly. Therefore, we develop a reinforcement learning system for VM rescheduling, VM2RL, which incorporates a set of customized techniques, such as a two-stage framework that accommodates diverse constraints and workload conditions, a feature extraction module that captures relational information specific to rescheduling, as well as a risk-seeking evaluation enabling users to optimize the trade-off between latency and accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments with data from an industry-scale data center. Our results show that VM2RL can achieve a performance comparable to the optimal solution but with a running time of seconds.

<div> online multicalibration, framework, adversarial settings, linear-product optimization, oracle-efficient<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces a framework for online multicalibration to ensure calibrated predictions across multiple groups in adversarial scenarios over T rounds. Unlike previous approaches, this study directly addresses online multicalibration in the ℓ1 norm, achieving improved rates of Õ(T^-1/3) and Õ(T^-1/4) for online ℓ1-multicalibration. The novel method involves a reduction of online ℓ1-multicalibration to online linear-product optimization (OLPO) and introduces a linearization technique combined with a no-regret algorithm to achieve the desired sublinear rate. To enhance scalability, an oracle-efficient approach to OLPO is proposed, making a polynomial number of calls to an offline optimization oracle. The framework's applicability extends to infinite group families by leveraging the Lipschitz property of the ℓ1-multicalibration error with respect to the group family. <div>
arXiv:2505.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study \emph{online multicalibration}, a framework for ensuring calibrated predictions across multiple groups in adversarial settings, across $T$ rounds. Although online calibration is typically studied in the $\ell_1$ norm, prior approaches to online multicalibration have taken the indirect approach of obtaining rates in other norms (such as $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$) and then transferred these guarantees to $\ell_1$ at additional loss. In contrast, we propose a direct method that achieves improved and oracle-efficient rates of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ respectively, for online $\ell_1$-multicalibration. Our key insight is a novel reduction of online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration to an online learning problem with product-based rewards, which we refer to as \emph{online linear-product optimization} ($\mathtt{OLPO}$).
  To obtain the improved rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, we introduce a linearization of $\mathtt{OLPO}$ and design a no-regret algorithm for this linearized problem. Although this method guarantees the desired sublinear rate (nearly matching the best rate for online calibration), it becomes computationally expensive when the group family \(\mathcal{H}\) is large or infinite, since it enumerates all possible groups. To address scalability, we propose a second approach to $\mathtt{OLPO}$ that makes only a polynomial number of calls to an offline optimization (\emph{multicalibration evaluation}) oracle, resulting in \emph{oracle-efficient} online \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. Our framework also extends to certain infinite families of groups (e.g., all linear functions on the context space) by exploiting a $1$-Lipschitz property of the \(\ell_1\)-multicalibration error with respect to \(\mathcal{H}\).

By minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance, FRIREN achieves accurate and interpretable forecasts for chaotic systems like Lorenz-63 and Rossler. The model also provides a spectral view of dynamics, enabling practitioners to analyze mode behavior locally and system-wide. FRIREN outperforms existing models like TimeMixer on forecasting accuracy for various datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in long-horizon predictions. The connection of modern generative flows with spectral analysis sets a new benchmark for LTSF model design. <div>

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.

<div> Keywords: Child literacy, Reading assessments, Automatic reading assessment systems, Xhosa language, End-to-end models

Summary: 
Child literacy is a crucial predictor of future life outcomes, especially in vulnerable populations. Targeted interventions are needed to bridge the gap between literacy levels in low-income areas and higher-income regions. The development of automatic reading assessment systems using AI can support educators in evaluating the effectiveness of literacy programs. This study focuses on Xhosa, a South African language, to improve child speech recognition capabilities. A novel dataset of Xhosa child speech samples is created, with each recording labeled using a cost-effective approach. Three state-of-the-art end-to-end models are evaluated on the dataset, showing the importance of training data amount and balance for optimal performance. The wav2vec 2.0 model benefits from training on multiple classes simultaneously, even with limited samples available.

Abstract: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is constrained.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step," which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods such as majority voting or best-of-n. With an inference budget of 64 generations, VGS with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-1.5B achieves an average accuracy of 45.7% across four competition math benchmarks (AIME 2024 & 2025, HMMT Feb 2024 & 2025), reaching parity with o3-mini-medium. Moreover, VGS significantly reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying the optimal scoring rule within the principal-agent framework for online information acquisition problem. We focus on the principal's perspective, seeking to determine the desired scoring rule through interactions with the agent. To address this challenge, we propose two algorithms: OIAFC and OIAFB, tailored for fixed confidence and fixed budget settings, respectively. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that OIAFC can extract the desired $(\epsilon, \delta)$-scoring rule with a efficient instance-dependent sample complexity or an instance-independent sample complexity. Our analysis also shows that OIAFB matches the instance-independent performance bound of OIAFC, while both algorithms share the same complexity across fixed confidence and fixed budget settings.

Summary:<br />
Discrete diffusion models have proven effective in modeling complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a balance between quality and speed. However, the performance of MDMs can degrade with fewer denoising steps due to limited modeling of inter-dimensional dependencies. The proposed Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD) framework enhances discrete diffusion models by incorporating latent variable modeling to capture correlations among dimensions. VADD introduces an auxiliary recognition model for stable training through variational lower bounds maximization and amortized inference. Empirical results across 2D toy data, pixel-level image generation, and text generation show that VADD outperforms MDM baselines in sample quality, particularly with a small number of denoising steps.<br />

arXiv:2505.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model, VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data, pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD consistently outperforms MDM baselines.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for solving expensive black-box optimization tasks. However, selecting an appropriate probabilistic surrogate model remains an important yet challenging problem. In this work, we introduce a novel Gaussian Process (GP)-based BO method that incorporates spectral mixture kernels, derived from spectral densities formed by scale-location mixtures of Cauchy and Gaussian distributions. This method achieves a significant improvement in both efficiency and optimization performance, matching the computational speed of simpler kernels while delivering results that outperform more complex models and automatic BO methods. We provide bounds on the information gain and cumulative regret associated with obtaining the optimum. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines across a diverse range of synthetic and real-world problems, including both low- and high-dimensional settings.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel framework for transfer learning in regression models, focusing on probability distributions in the Wasserstein space. It addresses the limitations of traditional transfer learning approaches that deal with scalar or multivariate data in Euclidean spaces. The proposed estimator for known informative source domains demonstrates provable asymptotic convergence rates, quantifying the impact of domain similarity on transfer efficiency. Additionally, a data-driven transfer learning procedure is developed for cases where the informative subset is unknown, aiming to mitigate negative transfer. The methods are supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and validated through simulations and real-world applications. This research contributes to enhancing learning in target domains by leveraging knowledge from source domains through the transfer of probability distributions. <div>

Abstract: Transfer learning is a powerful paradigm for leveraging knowledge from source domains to enhance learning in a target domain. However, traditional transfer learning approaches often focus on scalar or multivariate data within Euclidean spaces, limiting their applicability to complex data structures such as probability distributions. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for transfer learning in regression models, where outputs are probability distributions residing in the Wasserstein space. When the informative subset of transferable source domains is known, we propose an estimator with provable asymptotic convergence rates, quantifying the impact of domain similarity on transfer efficiency. For cases where the informative subset is unknown, we develop a data-driven transfer learning procedure designed to mitigate negative transfer. The proposed methods are supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and are validated through extensive simulations and real-world applications.

Summary:
HyperIMTS is a novel approach for forecasting irregular multivariate time series data. It utilizes a Hypergraph neural network to capture dependencies among unaligned observations across variables. This model represents observed values as nodes in a hypergraph, interconnected by temporal and variable hyperedges for efficient message passing. HyperIMTS adapts to the irregular time intervals within variables, allowing for accurate forecasting without the need for padded samples. By leveraging irregularity-aware message passing, HyperIMTS successfully captures variable dependencies in a time-adaptive manner. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of HyperIMTS compared to existing models in IMTS forecasting, all while maintaining low computational costs. Overall, HyperIMTS provides a unified framework for learning temporal and variable dependencies from original observations in irregular multivariate time series data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are characterized by irregular time intervals within variables and unaligned observations across variables, posing challenges in learning temporal and variable dependencies. Many existing IMTS models either require padded samples to learn separately from temporal and variable dimensions, or represent original samples via bipartite graphs or sets. However, the former approaches often need to handle extra padding values affecting efficiency and disrupting original sampling patterns, while the latter ones have limitations in capturing dependencies among unaligned observations. To represent and learn both dependencies from original observations in a unified form, we propose HyperIMTS, a Hypergraph neural network for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Observed values are converted as nodes in the hypergraph, interconnected by temporal and variable hyperedges to enable message passing among all observations. Through irregularity-aware message passing, HyperIMTS captures variable dependencies in a time-adaptive way to achieve accurate forecasting. Experiments demonstrate HyperIMTS's competitive performance among state-of-the-art models in IMTS forecasting with low computational cost.

<div> multicalibration, learning objective, predictor, empirical risk minimization, decision trees 

Summary:
This article introduces a novel discretization-free method for achieving multicalibration in predictors across diverse subpopulations. Unlike existing approaches that rely on discretization, this method directly optimizes an empirical risk objective using an ensemble of depth-two decision trees, enabling implementation with common tree ensemble learning methods. The algorithm ensures multicalibration under a condition termed loss saturation, which is found to hold in practical datasets. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently matches or surpasses existing methods, even when evaluated using comparable metrics. This approach eliminates the need for discretization, avoiding associated issues such as rounding error and hyperparameter sensitivity, and allows for improved downstream decision-making. <div>
arXiv:2505.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multicalibration has emerged as a desirable learning objective for ensuring that a predictor is calibrated across a rich collection of overlapping subpopulations. Existing approaches typically achieve multicalibration by discretizing the predictor's output space and iteratively adjusting its output values. However, this discretization approach departs from the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) pipeline, introduces rounding error and additional sensitive hyperparameter, and may distort the predictor's outputs in ways that hinder downstream decision-making.
  In this work, we propose a discretization-free multicalibration method that directly optimizes an empirical risk objective over an ensemble of depth-two decision trees. Our ERM approach can be implemented using off-the-shelf tree ensemble learning methods such as LightGBM. Our algorithm provably achieves multicalibration, provided that the data distribution satisfies a technical condition we term as loss saturation. Across multiple datasets, our empirical evaluation shows that this condition is always met in practice. Our discretization-free algorithm consistently matches or outperforms existing multicalibration approaches--even when evaluated using a discretization-based multicalibration metric that shares its discretization granularity with the baselines.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, self-training, reasoning-level confidence, CORE-PO, Policy Optimization

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in generating reasoning paths, but the high cost of human supervision for learning these paths is a challenge. Recent studies have explored self-training methods to improve reasoning capabilities using pseudo-labels generated by LLMs. However, existing methods focus solely on the quality of final answers and may overlook the quality of reasoning paths. This article proposes a new self-training method, CORE-PO, which prioritizes high-confidence reasoning paths through Policy Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that CORE-PO enhances the accuracy of outputs on various benchmarks, including in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. By considering reasoning-level confidence, CORE-PO improves the overall performance of LLMs in generating high-quality reasoning paths. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance by generating reasoning paths before final answers, but learning such a reasoning path requires costly human supervision. To address this issue, recent studies have explored self-training methods that improve reasoning capabilities using pseudo-labels generated by the LLMs themselves. Among these, confidence-based self-training fine-tunes LLMs to prefer reasoning paths with high-confidence answers, where confidence is estimated via majority voting. However, such methods exclusively focus on the quality of the final answer and may ignore the quality of the reasoning paths, as even an incorrect reasoning path leads to a correct answer by chance. Instead, we advocate the use of reasoning-level confidence to identify high-quality reasoning paths for self-training, supported by our empirical observations. We then propose a new self-training method, CORE-PO, that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer high-COnfidence REasoning paths through Policy Optimization. Our experiments show that CORE-PO improves the accuracy of outputs on four in-distribution and two out-of-distribution benchmarks, compared to existing self-training methods.

Summary: 
Machine learning on heterogeneous graphs has advanced rapidly, addressing the challenge of continual learning on evolving graph structures. The Meta-learning based Knowledge Distillation framework (MKD) combines meta-learning for rapid task adaptation with knowledge distillation to balance new information and existing knowledge. MKD uses a novel sampling strategy to efficiently select target-type nodes and retrieve first-order neighbors along metapaths. It incorporates a semantic-level distillation module to align attention distributions between teacher and student models for semantic consistency. Evaluations on benchmark datasets validate MKD's effectiveness in handling continual learning on expanding heterogeneous graphs. <div>
arXiv:2505.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning on heterogeneous graphs has experienced rapid advancement in recent years, driven by the inherently heterogeneous nature of real-world data. However, existing studies typically assume the graphs to be static, while real-world graphs are continuously expanding. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work addresses the challenge of continual learning on heterogeneous graphs by introducing the Meta-learning based Knowledge Distillation framework (MKD), designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in evolving heterogeneous graph structures. MKD combines rapid task adaptation through meta-learning on limited samples with knowledge distillation to achieve an optimal balance between incorporating new information and maintaining existing knowledge. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of sample selection, MKD incorporates a novel sampling strategy that selects a small number of target-type nodes based on node diversity and maintains fixed-size buffers for other types. The strategy retrieves first-order neighbors along metapaths and selects important neighbors based on their structural relevance, enabling the sampled subgraphs to retain key topological and semantic information. In addition, MKD introduces a semantic-level distillation module that aligns the attention distributions over different metapaths between teacher and student models, encouraging semantic consistency beyond the logit level. Comprehensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets validate MKD's effectiveness in handling continual learning scenarios on expanding heterogeneous graphs.

In particular, we develop a probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized optimization for nonlinear models that does not require Monte-Carlo sampling and thus improves upon previous methods. We also improve upon methods involving smooth approximations to the $\ell_0$ norm, and investigate layerwise methods. We compare the methods on different architectures and datasets, including convolutional networks trained on image datasets and transformers trained on parts of Wikipedia. We also created a synthetic teacher-student setup to investigate compression in a controlled continuous setting. Finally, we conceptually relate compression algorithms to Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference and empirically verify the prediction that regularized models can exhibit more sample-efficient convergence.

<div> Keywords: Reverse-Speech-Finder, Alzheimer's Disease, neural network, speech analysis, diagnostic models

Summary:
Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF) is a novel neural network architecture that enhances Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis through speech analysis by identifying AD-specific speech markers. RSF leverages pre-trained large language models to address the scarcity of real AD speech samples and limited interpretability in existing models. The architecture utilizes a unique approach involving the identification of the most probable speech markers (MPMs) and neurons (MPNs) for AD prediction. By backtracking from MPNs to the input layer, RSF identifies the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) and corresponding MPMs, uncovering new speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results show RSF outperforms traditional methods, improving accuracy and F1-score. By generating speech data with novel markers, RSF enhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models, offering insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and potential for effective early intervention strategies.

Abstract: This study introduces Reverse-Speech-Finder (RSF), a groundbreaking neural network backtracking architecture designed to enhance Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis through speech analysis. Leveraging the power of pre-trained large language models, RSF identifies and utilizes the most probable AD-specific speech markers, addressing both the scarcity of real AD speech samples and the challenge of limited interpretability in existing models. RSF's unique approach consists of three core innovations: Firstly, it exploits the observation that speech markers most probable of predicting AD, defined as the most probable speech-markers (MPMs), must have the highest probability of activating those neurons (in the neural network) with the highest probability of predicting AD, defined as the most probable neurons (MPNs). Secondly, it utilizes a speech token representation at the input layer, allowing backtracking from MPNs to identify the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) of AD. Lastly, it develops an innovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MPNs to the input layer, identifying the MPTs and the corresponding MPMs, and ingeniously uncovering novel speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results demonstrate RSF's superiority over traditional methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients, achieving a 3.5% improvement in accuracy and a 3.2% boost in F1-score. By generating speech data that encapsulates novel markers, RSF not only mitigates the limitations of real data scarcity but also significantly enhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models. These findings underscore RSF's potential as a transformative tool in speech-based AD detection, offering new insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and paving the way for more effective non-invasive early intervention strategies.

Summary:
ConfRover is a new autoregressive model designed to understand protein dynamics by learning from molecular dynamics (MD) data. This model captures temporal dependencies between protein conformations and supports both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. It includes an encoding layer to embed protein-specific information and conformation, a temporal module to capture conformational dynamics, and an SE(3) diffusion model for structure generation. ConfRover is effective in learning conformational dynamics from the ATLAS protein MD dataset and can be used for various downstream tasks. It is the first model to generate protein conformations and trajectories simultaneously, providing a novel and flexible approach to learning from protein MD data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.

<title>Hyperspectral in situ remote sensing of water surface nitrate in the Fitzroy River estuary, Queensland, Australia, using deep learning</title>

Abstract: Nitrate ($\text{NO}_3^-$) is a form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen derived primarily from anthropogenic sources. The recent increase in river-discharged nitrate poses a major risk for coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. Although nitrate is an optically inactive (i.e., colourless) constituent, previous studies have demonstrated there is an indirect, non-causal relationship between water surface nitrate and water-leaving reflectance that is mediated through optically active water quality parameters such as total suspended solids and coloured dissolved organic matter. This work aims to advance our understanding of this relationship with an effort to measure time-series nitrate and simultaneous hyperspectral reflectance at the Fitzroy River estuary, Queensland, Australia. Time-series observations revealed periodic cycles in nitrate loads due to the tidal influence in the estuarine study site. The water surface nitrate loads were predicted from hyperspectral reflectance and water salinity measurements, with hyperspectral reflectance indicating the concentrations of optically active variables and salinity indicating the mixing of river water and seawater proportions. The accuracy assessment of model-predicted nitrate against in-situ measured nitrate values showed that the predicted nitrate values correlated well with the ground-truth data, with an $R^2$ score of 0.86, and an RMSE of 0.03 mg/L. This work demonstrates the feasibility of predicting water surface nitrate from hyperspectral reflectance and salinity measurements.

<title>ExARNN: An Environment-Driven Adaptive RNN for Learning Non-Stationary Power Dynamics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17488</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stationary power system dynamics, influenced by renewable energy variability, evolving demand patterns, and climate change, are becoming increasingly complex. Accurately capturing these dynamics requires a model capable of adapting to environmental factors. Traditional models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), lack efficient mechanisms to encode external factors, such as time or environmental data, for dynamic adaptation. To address this, we propose the External Adaptive RNN (ExARNN), a novel framework that integrates external data (e.g., weather, time) to continuously adjust the parameters of a base RNN. ExARNN achieves this through a hierarchical hypernetwork design, using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to process external data and generate RNN parameters adaptively. This approach enables ExARNN to handle inconsistent timestamps between power and external measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation. Extensive forecasting tests demonstrate ExARNN's superiority over established baseline models.

<title>ProxySPEX: Inference-Efficient Interpretability via Sparse Feature Interactions in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17495</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX identifies features that influence model output over 20% more than those selected by marginal approaches. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task. ProxySPEX identifies interactions that enable more aggressive pruning of heads than marginal approaches.

<title>On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for online reinforcement learning (RL) presents a nuanced and systematically explorable design space. In this paper, we propose regularized policy gradient (RPG), a systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO. The code is available at https://github.com/complex-reasoning/RPG.

<title>What You Read Isn't What You Hear: Linguistic Sensitivity in Deepfake Speech Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level perturbations, leaving the impact of linguistic variation largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the linguistic sensitivity of both open-source and commercial anti-spoofing detectors by introducing transcript-level adversarial attacks. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even minor linguistic perturbations can significantly degrade detection accuracy: attack success rates surpass 60% on several open-source detector-voice pairs, and notably one commercial detection accuracy drops from 100% on synthetic audio to just 32%. Through a comprehensive feature attribution analysis, we identify that both linguistic complexity and model-level audio embedding similarity contribute strongly to detector vulnerability. We further demonstrate the real-world risk via a case study replicating the Brad Pitt audio deepfake scam, using transcript adversarial attacks to completely bypass commercial detectors. These results highlight the need to move beyond purely acoustic defenses and account for linguistic variation in the design of robust anti-spoofing systems. All source code will be publicly available.

<title>Spacetime Geometry of Denoising in Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on diffusion models using the framework of information geometry. We show that the set of noisy samples, taken across all noise levels simultaneously, forms a statistical manifold -- a family of denoising probability distributions. Interpreting the noise level as a temporal parameter, we refer to this manifold as spacetime. This manifold naturally carries a Fisher-Rao metric, which defines geodesics -- shortest paths between noisy points. Notably, this family of distributions is exponential, enabling efficient geodesic computation even in high-dimensional settings without retraining or fine-tuning. We demonstrate the practical value of this geometric viewpoint in transition path sampling, where spacetime geodesics define smooth sequences of Boltzmann distributions, enabling the generation of continuous trajectories between low-energy metastable states. Code is available at: https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/diffusion-spacetime-geometry.

<title>TimeCF: A TimeMixer-Based Model with adaptive Convolution and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss for long-term time seris forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that by introducing prior knowledge, multi-scale analysis of complex and non-stationary time series in real environments can achieve good results in the field of long-term forecasting. However, affected by channel-independent methods, models based on multi-scale analysis may produce suboptimal prediction results due to the autocorrelation between time series labels, which in turn affects the generalization ability of the model. To address this challenge, we are inspired by the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and the recently proposed FreDF method and design a deep learning model TimeCF for long-term time series forecasting based on the TimeMixer, combined with our designed adaptive convolution information aggregation module and Sharpness-Aware Minimization Frequency Domain Loss (SAMFre). Specifically, TimeCF first decomposes the original time series into sequences of different scales. Next, the same-sized convolution modules are used to adaptively aggregate information of different scales on sequences of different scales. Then, decomposing each sequence into season and trend parts and the two parts are mixed at different scales through bottom-up and top-down methods respectively. Finally, different scales are aggregated through a Feed-Forward Network. What's more, extensive experimental results on different real-world datasets show that our proposed TimeCF has excellent performance in the field of long-term forecasting.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fair machine learning algorithm to model interpretable differences between observed and desired human decision-making, with the latter aimed at reducing disparity in a downstream outcome impacted by the human decision. Prior work learns fair representations without considering the outcome in the decision-making process. We model the outcome disparities as arising due to the different representations of the input seen by the observed and desired decision-maker, which we term representational disparities. Our goal is to learn interpretable representational disparities which could potentially be corrected by specific nudges to the human decision, mitigating disparities in the downstream outcome; we frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem using a neural network. Under reasonable simplifying assumptions, we prove that our neural network model of the representational disparity learns interpretable weights that fully mitigate the outcome disparity. We validate objectives and interpret results using real-world German Credit, Adult, and Heritage Health datasets.

<title>Graph Style Transfer for Counterfactual Explainability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explainability seeks to uncover model decisions by identifying minimal changes to the input that alter the predicted outcome. This task becomes particularly challenging for graph data due to preserving structural integrity and semantic meaning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on forward perturbation mechanisms, we introduce Graph Inverse Style Transfer (GIST), the first framework to re-imagine graph counterfactual generation as a backtracking process, leveraging spectral style transfer. By aligning the global structure with the original input spectrum and preserving local content faithfulness, GIST produces valid counterfactuals as interpolations between the input style and counterfactual content. Tested on 8 binary and multi-class graph classification benchmarks, GIST achieves a remarkable +7.6% improvement in the validity of produced counterfactuals and significant gains (+45.5%) in faithfully explaining the true class distribution. Additionally, GIST's backtracking mechanism effectively mitigates overshooting the underlying predictor's decision boundary, minimizing the spectral differences between the input and the counterfactuals. These results challenge traditional forward perturbation methods, offering a novel perspective that advances graph explainability.

<title>Universal Biological Sequence Reranking for Improved De Novo Peptide Sequencing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De novo peptide sequencing is a critical task in proteomics. However, the performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs a list-wise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (Peptide Mass Deviation) and RMD (residual Mass Deviation), which offer delicate supervision by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only surpasses its base models used to generate training candidates for reranking pre-training, but also sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Moreover, RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen models whose generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and potential as a universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work presents a novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo sequencing. Our source code is provided on GitHub.

arXiv:2505.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE), a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and promote modularization among the experts.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wildfire spread is crucial for effective risk management, emergency response, and strategic resource allocation. In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from 2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations, vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1 score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and response.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning has recently attracted great attention, as PDEs are fundamental tools for modeling real-world systems that range from fundamental physical science to advanced engineering disciplines. Most real-world physical systems across various disciplines are actually involved in multiple coupled physical fields rather than a single field. However, previous machine learning studies mainly focused on solving single-field problems, but overlooked the importance and characteristics of multiphysics problems in real world. Multiphysics PDEs typically entail multiple strongly coupled variables, thereby introducing additional complexity and challenges, such as inter-field coupling. Both benchmarking and solving multiphysics problems with machine learning remain largely unexamined. To identify and address the emerging challenges in multiphysics problems, we mainly made three contributions in this work. First, we collect the first general multiphysics dataset, the Multiphysics Bench, that focuses on multiphysics PDE solving with machine learning. Multiphysics Bench is also the most comprehensive PDE dataset to date, featuring the broadest range of coupling types, the greatest diversity of PDE formulations, and the largest dataset scale. Second, we conduct the first systematic investigation on multiple representative learning-based PDE solvers, such as PINNs, FNO, DeepONet, and DiffusionPDE solvers, on multiphysics problems. Unfortunately, naively applying these existing solvers usually show very poor performance for solving multiphysics. Third, through extensive experiments and discussions, we report multiple insights and a bag of useful tricks for solving multiphysics with machine learning, motivating future directions in the study and simulation of complex, coupled physical systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ownership verification of deep neural network (DNN) models for image classification tasks. It allows verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.

Abstract: In autonomous navigation systems, the solution of the place recognition problem is crucial for their safe functioning. But this is not a trivial solution, since it must be accurate regardless of any changes in the scene, such as seasonal changes and different weather conditions, and it must be generalizable to other environments. This paper presents our method, MinkUNeXt-SI, which, starting from a LiDAR point cloud, preprocesses the input data to obtain its spherical coordinates and intensity values normalized within a range of 0 to 1 for each point, and it produces a robust place recognition descriptor. To that end, a deep learning approach that combines Minkowski convolutions and a U-net architecture with skip connections is used. The results of MinkUNeXt-SI demonstrate that this method reaches and surpasses state-of-the-art performance while it also generalizes satisfactorily to other datasets. Additionally, we showcase the capture of a custom dataset and its use in evaluating our solution, which also achieves outstanding results. Both the code of our solution and the runs of our dataset are publicly available for reproducibility purposes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across domains but face significant challenges when deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or personal devices such as laptops, due to high memory consumption and inference costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) of LLMs offers a promising solution that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with uniform quantization representation is favored for its efficiency and ease of deployment since uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on $\geq 2$-bit uniform quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model performance; however, they primarily focus on quantization methodologies, while the initialization of quantization parameters is underexplored and still relies on the suboptimal Min-Max strategies. In this work, we propose NeUQI, a method devoted to efficiently determining near-optimal initial parameters for uniform quantization. NeUQI is orthogonal to prior quantization methodologies and can seamlessly integrate with them. The experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen families on various tasks demonstrate that our NeUQI consistently outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation strategy, NeUQI can achieve superior performance to PV-tuning, a much more resource-intensive approach.

<title>Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision for Zero-Shot Inference on Text-Attributed Graphs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<title>Adaptive Semantic Token Communication for Transformer-based Edge Inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17604</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive framework for edge inference based on a dynamically configurable transformer-powered deep joint source channel coding (DJSCC) architecture. Motivated by a practical scenario where a resource constrained edge device engages in goal oriented semantic communication, such as selectively transmitting essential features for object detection to an edge server, our approach enables efficient task aware data transmission under varying bandwidth and channel conditions. To achieve this, input data is tokenized into compact high level semantic representations, refined by a transformer, and transmitted over noisy wireless channels. As part of the DJSCC pipeline, we employ a semantic token selection mechanism that adaptively compresses informative features into a user specified number of tokens per sample. These tokens are then further compressed through the JSCC module, enabling a flexible token communication strategy that adjusts both the number of transmitted tokens and their embedding dimensions. We incorporate a resource allocation algorithm based on Lyapunov stochastic optimization to enhance robustness under dynamic network conditions, effectively balancing compression efficiency and task performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our system consistently outperforms existing baselines, highlighting its potential as a strong foundation for AI native semantic communication in edge intelligence applications.

Abstract: This paper provides the first expert sample complexity characterization for learning a Nash equilibrium from expert data in Markov Games. We show that a new quantity named the single policy deviation concentrability coefficient is unavoidable in the non-interactive imitation learning setting, and we provide an upper bound for behavioral cloning (BC) featuring such coefficient. BC exhibits substantial regret in games with high concentrability coefficient, leading us to utilize expert queries to develop and introduce two novel solution algorithms: MAIL-BRO and MURMAIL. The former employs a best response oracle and learns an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ expert and oracle queries. The latter bypasses completely the best response oracle at the cost of a worse expert query complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$. Finally, we provide numerical evidence, confirming our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Predicting human daily behavior is challenging due to the complexity of routine patterns and short-term fluctuations. While data-driven models have improved behavior prediction by leveraging empirical data from various platforms and devices, the reliance on sensitive, large-scale user data raises privacy concerns and limits data availability. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution, though existing methods are often limited to specific applications. In this work, we introduce BehaviorGen, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic behavior data. By simulating user behavior based on profiles and real events, BehaviorGen supports data augmentation and replacement in behavior prediction models. We evaluate its performance in scenarios such as pertaining augmentation, fine-tuning replacement, and fine-tuning augmentation, achieving significant improvements in human mobility and smartphone usage predictions, with gains of up to 18.9%. Our results demonstrate the potential of BehaviorGen to enhance user behavior modeling through flexible and privacy-preserving synthetic data generation.

arXiv:2505.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic DNN optimization techniques such as layer-skipping offer increased adaptability and efficiency gains but can lead to i) a larger memory footprint as in decision gates, ii) increased training complexity (e.g., with non-differentiable operations), and iii) less control over performance-quality trade-offs due to its inherent input-dependent execution. To approach these issues, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative for adaptive inference with a zero-overhead, single-model, and time-predictable inference. Central to our approach is the observation that models trained with Stochastic Depth -- a method for faster training of residual networks -- become more resilient to arbitrary layer-skipping at inference time. We propose a method to first select near Pareto-optimal skipping configurations from a stochastically-trained model to adapt the inference at runtime later. Compared to original ResNets, our method shows improvements of up to 2X in power efficiency at accuracy drops as low as 0.71%.

Abstract: Various AI safety datasets have been developed to measure LLMs against evolving interpretations of harm. Our evaluation of five recently published open-source safety benchmarks reveals distinct semantic clusters using UMAP dimensionality reduction and kmeans clustering (silhouette score: 0.470). We identify six primary harm categories with varying benchmark representation. GretelAI, for example, focuses heavily on privacy concerns, while WildGuardMix emphasizes self-harm scenarios. Significant differences in prompt length distribution suggests confounds to data collection and interpretations of harm as well as offer possible context. Our analysis quantifies benchmark orthogonality among AI benchmarks, allowing for transparency in coverage gaps despite topical similarities. Our quantitative framework for analyzing semantic orthogonality across safety benchmarks enables more targeted development of datasets that comprehensively address the evolving landscape of harms in AI use, however that is defined in the future.

<title>Causal Spatio-Temporal Prediction: An Effective and Efficient Multi-Modal Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation, weather forecasting, and urban planning. While integrating multi-modal data has shown potential for enhancing prediction accuracy, key challenges persist: (i) inadequate fusion of multi-modal information, (ii) confounding factors that obscure causal relations, and (iii) high computational complexity of prediction models. To address these challenges, we propose E^2-CSTP, an Effective and Efficient Causal multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Prediction framework. E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating mechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we design a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on spatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by modeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover true causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with the Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in accuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead.

<title>Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17638</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.

<title>PreMoe: Lightening MoEs on Constrained Memory by Expert Pruning and Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17639</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures enable scaling large language models (LLMs) to vast parameter counts without a proportional rise in computational costs. However, the significant memory demands of large MoE models hinder their deployment across various computational environments, from cloud servers to consumer devices. This study first demonstrates pronounced task-specific specialization in expert activation patterns within MoE layers. Building on this, we introduce PreMoe, a novel framework that enables efficient deployment of massive MoE models in memory-constrained environments. PreMoe features two main components: probabilistic expert pruning (PEP) and task-adaptive expert retrieval (TAER). PEP employs a new metric, the task-conditioned expected selection score (TCESS), derived from router logits to quantify expert importance for specific tasks, thereby identifying a minimal set of critical experts. TAER leverages these task-specific expert importance profiles for efficient inference. It pre-computes and stores compact expert patterns for diverse tasks. When a user query is received, TAER rapidly identifies the most relevant stored task pattern and reconstructs the model by loading only the small subset of experts crucial for that task. This approach dramatically reduces the memory footprint across all deployment scenarios. DeepSeek-R1 671B maintains 97.2\% accuracy on MATH500 when pruned to 8/128 configuration (50\% expert reduction), and still achieves 72.0\% with aggressive 8/32 pruning (87.5\% expert reduction). Pangu-Ultra-MoE 718B achieves 97.15\% on MATH500 and 81.3\% on AIME24 with 8/128 pruning, while even more aggressive pruning to 4/64 (390GB memory) preserves 96.95\% accuracy on MATH500. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/PreMoe.

arXiv:2505.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that the loss landscape of large language models resembles a basin, within which the models perform nearly identically, and outside of which they lose all their capabilities. In this work, we conduct further studies on the loss landscape of large language models. We discover that pre-training creates a "basic capability" basin, and subsequent fine-tuning creates "specific capability" basins (e.g., math, safety, coding) within the basic capability basin. We further investigate two types of loss landscapes: the most-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along most directions) and the worst-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along the worst direction). We argue that as long as benign fine-tuning remains within the most-case basin, it will not compromise previous capabilities. Similarly, any fine-tuning (including the adversarial one) that stays within the worst-case basin would not compromise previous capabilities. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that the size of the most-case basin can bound the size of the worst-case basin and the robustness with respect to input perturbations. We also show that, due to the over-parameterization property of current large language models, one can easily enlarge the basins by five times.

<title>Rethinking the Sampling Criteria in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning: A Competence-Difficulty Alignment Perspective</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning exhibits potential in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet it is hard to scale for the low sample efficiency during the rollout phase. Existing methods attempt to improve efficiency by scheduling problems based on problem difficulties. However, these approaches suffer from unstable and biased estimations of problem difficulty and fail to capture the alignment between model competence and problem difficulty in RL training, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces \textbf{C}ompetence-\textbf{D}ifficulty \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{S}ampling (\textbf{CDAS}), which enables accurate and stable estimation of problem difficulties by aggregating historical performance discrepancies of problems. Then the model competence is quantified to adaptively select problems whose difficulty is in alignment with the model's current competence using a fixed-point system. Experimental results across a range of challenging mathematical benchmarks show that CDAS achieves great improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. CDAS attains the highest average accuracy against baselines and exhibits significant speed advantages compared to Dynamic Sampling, a competitive strategy in DAPO, which is \textbf{2.33} times slower than CDAS.

Abstract: Neighborhood-aware tokenized graph Transformers have recently shown great potential for node classification tasks. Despite their effectiveness, our in-depth analysis of neighborhood tokens reveals two critical limitations in the existing paradigm. First, current neighborhood token generation methods fail to adequately capture attribute correlations within a neighborhood. Second, the conventional self-attention mechanism suffers from attention diversion when processing neighborhood tokens, where high-hop neighborhoods receive disproportionate focus, severely disrupting information interactions between the target node and its neighborhood tokens. To address these challenges, we propose DAM-GT, Dual positional encoding-based Attention Masking graph Transformer. DAM-GT introduces a novel dual positional encoding scheme that incorporates attribute-aware encoding via an attribute clustering strategy, effectively preserving node correlations in both topological and attribute spaces. In addition, DAM-GT formulates a new attention mechanism with a simple yet effective masking strategy to guide interactions between target nodes and their neighborhood tokens, overcoming the issue of attention diversion. Extensive experiments on various graphs with different homophily levels as well as different scales demonstrate that DAM-GT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce automated scientific minimization of regret (ASMR) -- a framework for automated computational cognitive science. Building on the principles of scientific regret minimization, ASMR leverages Centaur -- a recently proposed foundation model of human cognition -- to identify gaps in an interpretable cognitive model. These gaps are then addressed through automated revisions generated by a language-based reasoning model. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in a multi-attribute decision-making task, showing that ASMR discovers cognitive models that predict human behavior at noise ceiling while retaining interpretability. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ASMR to automate core components of the cognitive modeling pipeline.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).

Abstract: Memorization impacts the performance of deep learning algorithms. Prior works have studied memorization primarily in the context of generalization and privacy. This work studies the memorization effect on incremental learning scenarios. Forgetting prevention and memorization seem similar. However, one should discuss their differences. We designed extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of memorization on continual learning. We clarified that learning examples with high memorization scores are forgotten faster than regular samples. Our findings also indicated that memorization is necessary to achieve the highest performance. However, at low memory regimes, forgetting regular samples is more important. We showed that the importance of a high-memorization score sample rises with an increase in the buffer size. We introduced a memorization proxy and employed it in the buffer policy problem to showcase how memorization could be used during incremental training. We demonstrated that including samples with a higher proxy memorization score is beneficial when the buffer size is large.

<title>Towards General Continuous Memory for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs), have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential. Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this, we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Prefix-sharing among multiple prompts presents opportunities to combine the operations of the shared prefix, while attention computation in the decode stage, which becomes a critical bottleneck with increasing context lengths, is a memory-intensive process requiring heavy memory access on the key-value (KV) cache of the prefixes. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the potential of prefix-sharing in the attention computation of the decode stage. However, the tree structure of the prefix-sharing mechanism presents significant challenges for attention computation in efficiently processing shared KV cache access patterns while managing complex dependencies and balancing irregular workloads. To address the above challenges, we propose a dedicated attention kernel to combine the memory access of shared prefixes in the decoding stage, namely FlashForge. FlashForge delivers two key innovations: a novel shared-prefix attention kernel that optimizes memory hierarchy and exploits both intra-block and inter-block parallelism, and a comprehensive workload balancing mechanism that efficiently estimates cost, divides tasks, and schedules execution. Experimental results show that FlashForge achieves an average 1.9x speedup and 120.9x memory access reduction compared to the state-of-the-art FlashDecoding kernel regarding attention computation in the decode stage and 3.8x end-to-end time per output token compared to the vLLM.

Abstract: Despite the advances in Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) benchmarks, their evaluation protocols remain constrained, primarily focusing on either single targets with short queries (containing minimal attributes) or multiple targets from distinctly different queries on a single domain. This limitation significantly hinders the assessment of more complex reasoning capabilities in RES models. We introduce WildRES, a novel benchmark that incorporates long queries with diverse attributes and non-distinctive queries for multiple targets. This benchmark spans diverse application domains, including autonomous driving environments and robotic manipulation scenarios, thus enabling more rigorous evaluation of complex reasoning capabilities in real-world settings. Our analysis reveals that current RES models demonstrate substantial performance deterioration when evaluated on WildRES. To address this challenge, we introduce SynRES, an automated pipeline generating densely paired compositional synthetic training data through three innovations: (1) a dense caption-driven synthesis for attribute-rich image-mask-expression triplets, (2) reliable semantic alignment mechanisms rectifying caption-pseudo mask inconsistencies via Image-Text Aligned Grouping, and (3) domain-aware augmentations incorporating mosaic composition and superclass replacement to emphasize generalization ability and distinguishing attributes over object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SynRES achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving gIoU by 2.0% on WildRES-ID and 3.8% on WildRES-DS. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/UTLLab/SynRES.

<title>COUNTDOWN: Contextually Sparse Activation Filtering Out Unnecessary Weights in Down Projection</title>

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.

<title>The Third Pillar of Causal Analysis? A Measurement Perspective on Causal Representations</title>

Abstract: Causal reasoning and discovery, two fundamental tasks of causal analysis, often face challenges in applications due to the complexity, noisiness, and high-dimensionality of real-world data. Despite recent progress in identifying latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity (T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios, including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis, demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for causal downstream tasks.

<title>PPO-BR: Dual-Signal Entropy-Reward Adaptation for Trust Region Policy Optimization</title>

arXiv:2505.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) dominating policy gradient methods -- from robotic control to game AI -- its static trust region forces a brittle trade-off: aggressive clipping stifles early exploration, while late-stage updates destabilize convergence. PPO-BR establishes a new paradigm in adaptive RL by fusing exploration and convergence signals into a single bounded trust region -- a theoretically grounded innovation that outperforms five SOTA baselines with less than 2% overhead. This work bridges a critical gap in phase-aware learning, enabling real-world deployment in safety-critical systems like robotic surgery within a single adaptive mechanism. PPO-BR achieves 29.1% faster convergence by combining: (1) entropy-driven expansion (epsilon up) for exploration in high-uncertainty states, and (2) reward-guided contraction (epsilon down) for convergence stability. On six diverse benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, sparse-reward), PPO-BR achieves 29.1% faster convergence (p < 0.001), 2.3x lower reward variance than PPO, and less than 1.8% runtime overhead with only five lines of code change. PPO-BR's simplicity and theoretical guarantees make it ready-to-deploy in safety-critical domains -- from surgical robotics to autonomous drones. In contrast to recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), PPO-BR offers a unified entropy-reward mechanism applicable to both language models and general reinforcement learning environments.

<title>Get Experience from Practice: LLM Agents with Record &amp; Replay</title>

Abstract: AI agents, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and communication protocols such as MCP and A2A, have rapidly evolved from simple chatbots to autonomous entities capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks, demonstrating great potential. However, the LLMs' inherent uncertainty and heavy computational resource requirements pose four significant challenges to the development of safe and efficient agents: reliability, privacy, cost and performance. Existing approaches, like model alignment, workflow constraints and on-device model deployment, can partially alleviate some issues but often with limitations, failing to fundamentally resolve these challenges.
  This paper proposes a new paradigm called AgentRR (Agent Record & Replay), which introduces the classical record-and-replay mechanism into AI agent frameworks. The core idea is to: 1. Record an agent's interaction trace with its environment and internal decision process during task execution, 2. Summarize this trace into a structured "experience" encapsulating the workflow and constraints, and 3. Replay these experiences in subsequent similar tasks to guide the agent's behavior. We detail a multi-level experience abstraction method and a check function mechanism in AgentRR: the former balances experience specificity and generality, while the latter serves as a trust anchor to ensure completeness and safety during replay. In addition, we explore multiple application modes of AgentRR, including user-recorded task demonstration, large-small model collaboration and privacy-aware agent execution, and envision an experience repository for sharing and reusing knowledge to further reduce deployment cost.

Abstract: Machine learning methods for global medium-range weather forecasting have recently received immense attention. Following the publication of the Pangu Weather model, the first deep learning model to outperform traditional numerical simulations of the atmosphere, numerous models have been published in this domain, building on Pangu's success. However, all of these models operate on input data and produce predictions on the Driscoll--Healy discretization of the sphere which suffers from a much finer grid at the poles than around the equator. In contrast, in the Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelization (HEALPix) of the sphere, each pixel covers the same surface area, removing unphysical biases. Motivated by a growing support for this grid in meteorology and climate sciences, we propose to perform weather forecasting with deep learning models which natively operate on the HEALPix grid. To this end, we introduce Pangu Equal ARea (PEAR), a transformer-based weather forecasting model which operates directly on HEALPix-features and outperforms the corresponding model on Driscoll--Healy without any computational overhead.

<title>Redirection for Erasing Memory (REM): Towards a universal unlearning method for corrupted data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is studied for a multitude of tasks, but specialization of unlearning methods to particular tasks has made their systematic comparison challenging. To address this issue, we propose a conceptual space to characterize diverse corrupted data unlearning tasks in vision classifiers. This space is described by two dimensions, the discovery rate (the fraction of the corrupted data that are known at unlearning time) and the statistical regularity of the corrupted data (from random exemplars to shared concepts). Methods proposed previously have been targeted at portions of this space and-we show-fail predictably outside these regions. We propose a novel method, Redirection for Erasing Memory (REM), whose key feature is that corrupted data are redirected to dedicated neurons introduced at unlearning time and then discarded or deactivated to suppress the influence of corrupted data. REM performs strongly across the space of tasks, in contrast to prior SOTA methods that fail outside the regions for which they were designed.

Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) promise to reduce congestion in future urban networks, potentially by optimizing their routing decisions. Unlike for human drivers, these decisions can be made with collective, data-driven policies, developed by machine learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning (RL) can facilitate the development of such collective routing strategies, yet standardized and realistic benchmarks are missing. To that end, we present \our{}: Urban Routing Benchmark for RL-equipped Connected Autonomous Vehicles. \our{} is a comprehensive benchmarking environment that unifies evaluation across 29 real-world traffic networks paired with realistic demand patterns. \our{} comes with a catalog of predefined tasks, four state-of-the-art multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm implementations, three baseline methods, domain-specific performance metrics, and a modular configuration scheme. Our results suggest that, despite the lengthy and costly training, state-of-the-art MARL algorithms rarely outperformed humans. Experimental results reported in this paper initiate the first leaderboard for MARL in large-scale urban routing optimization and reveal that current approaches struggle to scale, emphasizing the urgent need for advancements in this domain.

<title>A tensor network approach for chaotic time series prediction</title>

Abstract: Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge. Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However, selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem. Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalised discrete distributions is a fundamental problem across various domains. While Markov chain Monte Carlo offers a principled approach, it often suffers from slow mixing and poor convergence. In this paper, we propose Discrete Neural Flow Samplers (DNFS), a trainable and efficient framework for discrete sampling. DNFS learns the rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain such that the resulting dynamics satisfy the Kolmogorov equation. As this objective involves the intractable partition function, we then employ control variates to reduce the variance of its Monte Carlo estimation, leading to a coordinate descent learning algorithm. To further facilitate computational efficiency, we propose locally equivaraint Transformer, a novel parameterisation of the rate matrix that significantly improves training efficiency while preserving powerful network expressiveness. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of DNFS in a wide range of applications, including sampling from unnormalised distributions, training discrete energy-based models, and solving combinatorial optimisation problems.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we reproduce 23 up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which reduce the training/testing time by 10-40x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite of 18 synthetic/realistic tasks (1900+ instances) spanning single-objective, multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4) plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.

<title>Soft-CAM: Making black box models self-explainable for high-stakes decisions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for high-stakes applications like medicine, often surpassing human performance. However, most explanation methods rely on post-hoc attribution, approximating the decision-making process of already trained black-box models. These methods are often sensitive, unreliable, and fail to reflect true model reasoning, limiting their trustworthiness in critical applications. In this work, we introduce SoftCAM, a straightforward yet effective approach that makes standard CNN architectures inherently interpretable. By removing the global average pooling layer and replacing the fully connected classification layer with a convolution-based class evidence layer, SoftCAM preserves spatial information and produces explicit class activation maps that form the basis of the model's predictions. Evaluated on three medical datasets, SoftCAM maintains classification performance while significantly improving both the qualitative and quantitative explanation compared to existing post-hoc methods. Our results demonstrate that CNNs can be inherently interpretable without compromising performance, advancing the development of self-explainable deep learning for high-stakes decision-making.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning in pixel-based environments presents a significant challenge, often resulting in diminished performance. While recent works have proposed algorithmic and architectural approaches to address this, the underlying cause of the performance drop remains unclear. In this paper, we identify the connection between the output of the encoder (a stack of convolutional layers) and the ensuing dense layers as the main underlying factor limiting scaling capabilities; we denote this connection as the bottleneck, and we demonstrate that previous approaches implicitly target this bottleneck. As a result of our analyses, we present global average pooling as a simple yet effective way of targeting the bottleneck, thereby avoiding the complexity of earlier approaches.

arXiv:2505.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent safety evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that many models exhibit dishonest behavior, such as sycophancy. However, most honesty benchmarks focus exclusively on factual knowledge or explicitly harmful behavior and rely on external judges, which are often unable to detect less obvious forms of dishonesty. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Judge Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), which utilizes steering vectors trained on a single sample to elicit more honest responses from models, helping LLM-judges in the detection of dishonest behavior. To test our framework, we introduce a new manipulation dataset with prompts specifically designed to elicit deceptive responses. We find that JUSSA enables LLM judges to better differentiate between dishonest and benign responses, and helps them identify subtle instances of manipulative behavior.

Abstract: Structured Linear Controlled Differential Equations (SLiCEs) provide a unifying framework for sequence models with structured, input-dependent state-transition matrices that retain the maximal expressivity of dense matrices whilst being cheaper to compute. The framework encompasses existing architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel variants based on sparsity and the Walsh--Hadamard transform. We prove that, unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4 and Mamba, SLiCEs employing block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh--Hadamard matrices match the maximal expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$ state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and match the state-of-the-art performance of log neural controlled differential equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.

Abstract: The widespread use of sensors in modern power grids has led to the accumulation of large amounts of voltage and current waveform data, especially during fault events. However, the lack of labeled datasets poses a significant challenge for fault classification and analysis. This paper explores the application of unsupervised clustering techniques for fault diagnosis in high-voltage power systems. A dataset provided by the Reseau de Transport d'Electricite (RTE) is analyzed, with frequency domain features extracted using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The K-Means algorithm is then applied to identify underlying patterns in the data, enabling automated fault categorization without the need for labeled training samples. The resulting clusters are evaluated in collaboration with power system experts to assess their alignment with real-world fault characteristics. The results demonstrate the potential of unsupervised learning for scalable and data-driven fault analysis, providing a robust approach to detecting and classifying power system faults with minimal prior assumptions.

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools for nonlinear learning with well-established theory. The scalability issue has been their long-standing challenge. Despite the existing success, there are two limitations in large-scale kernel methods: (i) The memory overhead is too high for users to afford; (ii) existing efforts mainly focus on kernel ridge regression (KRR), while other models lack study. In this paper, we propose Joker, a joint optimization framework for diverse kernel models, including KRR, logistic regression, and support vector machines. We design a dual block coordinate descent method with trust region (DBCD-TR) and adopt kernel approximation with randomized features, leading to low memory costs and high efficiency in large-scale learning. Experiments show that Joker saves up to 90\% memory but achieves comparable training time and performance (or even better) than the state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA): A Scalable Approach to Interpreting Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2505.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing Large Langage Models (LLM) activations into interpretable latents. However, due to their substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be trained in just 1\% of the time required for SAEs, using 1\% of the data. This allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU. ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are necessary. Code available at https://github.com/pleask/itda.

<title>C-LoRA: Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation for Uncertainty Estimation in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a cost-effective solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but it often produces overconfident predictions in data-scarce few-shot settings. To address this issue, several classical statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (\textbf{C-LoRA}) as a novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.

<title>Optimizing Shortfall Risk Metric for Learning Regression Models</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating and optimizing utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR) of a loss, say $(Y - \hat Y)^2$, in the context of a regression problem. Empirical risk minimization with a UBSR objective is challenging since UBSR is a non-linear function of the underlying distribution. We first derive a concentration bound for UBSR estimation using independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We then frame the UBSR optimization problem as minimization of a pseudo-linear function in the space of achievable distributions $\mathcal D$ of the loss $(Y- \hat Y)^2$. We construct a gradient oracle for the UBSR objective and a linear minimization oracle (LMO) for the set $\mathcal D$. Using these oracles, we devise a bisection-type algorithm, and establish convergence to the UBSR-optimal solution.

Abstract: Graph representation learning is effective for obtaining a meaningful latent space utilizing the structure of graph data and is widely applied, including biological networks. In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision. SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification (node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) represent dynamic facts as timestamped relations between entities. TKG completion involves forecasting missing or future links, requiring models to reason over time-evolving structure. While LLMs show promise for this task, existing approaches often overemphasize supervised fine-tuning and struggle particularly when historical evidence is limited or missing. We introduce RECIPE-TKG, a lightweight and data-efficient framework designed to improve accuracy and generalization in settings with sparse historical context. It combines (1) rule-based multi-hop retrieval for structurally diverse history, (2) contrastive fine-tuning of lightweight adapters to encode relational semantics, and (3) test-time semantic filtering to iteratively refine generations based on embedding similarity. Experiments on four TKG benchmarks show that RECIPE-TKG outperforms previous LLM-based approaches, achieving up to 30.6\% relative improvement in Hits@10. Moreover, our proposed framework produces more semantically coherent predictions, even for the samples with limited historical context.

Abstract: We introduce Variational Latent Mode Decomposition (VLMD), a new algorithm for extracting oscillatory modes and associated connectivity structures from multivariate signals. VLMD addresses key limitations of existing Multivariate Mode Decomposition (MMD) techniques -including high computational cost, sensitivity to parameter choices, and weak modeling of interchannel dependencies. Its improved performance is driven by a novel underlying model, Latent Mode Decomposition (LMD), which blends sparse coding and mode decomposition to represent multichannel signals as sparse linear combinations of shared latent components composed of AM-FM oscillatory modes. This formulation enables VLMD to operate in a lower-dimensional latent space, enhancing robustness to noise, scalability, and interpretability. The algorithm solves a constrained variational optimization problem that jointly enforces reconstruction fidelity, sparsity, and frequency regularization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLMD outperforms state-of-the-art MMD methods in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of extracted structures.

Abstract: Coreset selection targets the challenge of finding a small, representative subset of a large dataset that preserves essential patterns for effective machine learning. Although several surveys have examined data reduction strategies before, most focus narrowly on either classical geometry-based methods or active learning techniques. In contrast, this survey presents a more comprehensive view by unifying three major lines of coreset research, namely, training-free, training-oriented, and label-free approaches, into a single taxonomy. We present subfields often overlooked by existing work, including submodular formulations, bilevel optimization, and recent progress in pseudo-labeling for unlabeled datasets. Additionally, we examine how pruning strategies influence generalization and neural scaling laws, offering new insights that are absent from prior reviews. Finally, we compare these methods under varying computational, robustness, and performance demands and highlight open challenges, such as robustness, outlier filtering, and adapting coreset selection to foundation models, for future research.

<title>Hyperparameter Optimization via Interacting with Probabilistic Circuits</title>

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in designing truly interactive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods, to date, only a few allow to include human feedback. Existing interactive Bayesian optimization (BO) methods incorporate human beliefs by weighting the acquisition function with a user-defined prior distribution. However, in light of the non-trivial inner optimization of the acquisition function prevalent in BO, such weighting schemes do not always accurately reflect given user beliefs. We introduce a novel BO approach leveraging tractable probabilistic models named probabilistic circuits (PCs) as a surrogate model. PCs encode a tractable joint distribution over the hybrid hyperparameter space and evaluation scores. They enable exact conditional inference and sampling. Based on conditional sampling, we construct a novel selection policy that enables an acquisition function-free generation of candidate points (thereby eliminating the need for an additional inner-loop optimization) and ensures that user beliefs are reflected accurately in the selection policy. We provide a theoretical analysis and an extensive empirical evaluation, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard HPO and outperforms interactive BO baselines in interactive HPO.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a performance-critical component of many machine learning pipelines. Rigorous benchmarking is essential for evaluating the performance of vector indexes for ANN search. However, the datasets of the existing benchmarks are no longer representative of the current applications of ANN search. Hence, there is an urgent need for an up-to-date set of benchmarks. To this end, we introduce Vector Index Benchmark for Embeddings (VIBE), an open source project for benchmarking ANN algorithms. VIBE contains a pipeline for creating benchmark datasets using dense embedding models characteristic of modern applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To replicate real-world workloads, we also include out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets where the queries and the corpus are drawn from different distributions. We use VIBE to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of SOTA vector indexes, benchmarking 21 implementations on 12 in-distribution and 6 out-of-distribution datasets.

<title>Imagine Beyond! Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for State Space Coverage in Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17830</link>

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space, to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization. DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass, without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

<title>TransDF: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment</title>

Abstract: Training time-series forecasting models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Transform-enhanced Direct Forecast (TransDF), which transforms the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransDF achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecasting models. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TransDF-88CF.

<title>Scaling Recurrent Neural Networks to a Billion Parameters with Zero-Order Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17852</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During inference, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) scale constant in both FLOPs and GPU memory with increasing context length, as they compress all prior tokens into a fixed-size memory. In contrast, transformers scale linearly in FLOPs and, at best, linearly in memory during generation, since they must attend to all previous tokens explicitly. Despite this inference-time advantage, training large RNNs on long contexts remains impractical because standard optimization methods depend on Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). BPTT requires retention of all intermediate activations during the forward pass, causing memory usage to scale linearly with both context length and model size. In this paper, we show that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) methods such as Random-vector Gradient Estimation (RGE) can successfully replace BPTT to train RNNs with convergence rates that match, or exceed BPTT by up to 19 fold, while using orders of magnitude less memory and cost, as the model remains in inference mode throughout training. We further demonstrate that Central-Difference RGE (CD-RGE) corresponds to optimizing a smoothed surrogate loss, inherently regularizing training and improving generalization. Our method matches or outperforms BPTT across three settings: (1) overfitting, (2) transduction, and (3) language modeling. Across all tasks, with sufficient perturbations, our models generalize as well as or better than those trained with BPTT, often in fewer steps. Despite the need for more forward passes per step, we can surpass BPTT wall-clock time per step using recent advancements such as FlashRNN and distributed inference.

<title>Out of the Shadows: Exploring a Latent Space for Neural Network Verification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17854</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are ubiquitous. However, they are often sensitive to small input changes. Hence, to prevent unexpected behavior in safety-critical applications, their formal verification -- a notoriously hard problem -- is necessary. Many state-of-the-art verification algorithms use reachability analysis or abstract interpretation to enclose the set of possible outputs of a neural network. Often, the verification is inconclusive due to the conservatism of the enclosure. To address this problem, we design a novel latent space for formal verification that enables the transfer of output specifications to the input space for an iterative specification-driven input refinement, i.e., we iteratively reduce the set of possible inputs to only enclose the unsafe ones. The latent space is constructed from a novel view of projection-based set representations, e.g., zonotopes, which are commonly used in reachability analysis of neural networks. A projection-based set representation is a "shadow" of a higher-dimensional set -- a latent space -- that does not change during a set propagation through a neural network. Hence, the input set and the output enclosure are "shadows" of the same latent space that we can use to transfer constraints. We present an efficient verification tool for neural networks that uses our iterative refinement to significantly reduce the number of subproblems in a branch-and-bound procedure. Using zonotopes as a set representation, unlike many other state-of-the-art approaches, our approach can be realized by only using matrix operations, which enables a significant speed-up through efficient GPU acceleration. We demonstrate that our tool achieves competitive performance, which would place it among the top-ranking tools of the last neural network verification competition (VNN-COMP'24).

Abstract: While offering a principled framework for uncertainty quantification in deep learning, the employment of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) is still constrained by their increased computational requirements and the convergence difficulties when training very deep, state-of-the-art architectures. In this work, we reinterpret weight-sharing quantization techniques from a stochastic perspective in the context of training and inference with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Specifically, we leverage 2D adaptive Gaussian distributions, Wasserstein distance estimations, and alpha blending to encode the stochastic behaviour of a BNN in a lower dimensional, soft Gaussian representation. Through extensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the computational overhead inherent in Bayesian learning by several orders of magnitude, enabling the efficient Bayesian training of large-scale models, such as ResNet-101 and Vision Transformer (VIT). On various computer vision benchmarks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet1k. Our approach compresses model parameters by approximately 50x and reduces model size by 75, while achieving accuracy and uncertainty estimations comparable to the state-of-the-art.

<title>Scalable Valuation of Human Feedback through Provably Robust Model Alignment</title>

Abstract: Despite the importance of aligning language models with human preferences, crowd-sourced human feedback is often noisy -- for example, preferring less desirable responses -- posing a fundamental challenge to alignment. A truly robust alignment objective should yield identical model parameters even under severe label noise, a property known as redescending. We prove that no existing alignment methods satisfy this property. To address this, we propose H\"older-DPO, the first principled alignment loss with a provable redescending property, enabling estimation of the clean data distribution from noisy feedback. The aligned model estimates the likelihood of clean data, providing a theoretically grounded metric for dataset valuation that identifies the location and fraction of mislabels. This metric is gradient-free, enabling scalable and automated human feedback valuation without costly manual verification or clean validation dataset. H\"older-DPO achieves state-of-the-art robust alignment performance while accurately detecting mislabels in controlled datasets. Finally, we apply H\"older-DPO to widely used alignment datasets, revealing substantial noise levels and demonstrating that removing these mislabels significantly improves alignment performance across methods.

<title>The emergence of sparse attention: impact of data distribution and benefits of repetition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergence is a fascinating property of large language models and neural networks more broadly: as models scale and train for longer, they sometimes develop new abilities in sudden ways. Despite initial studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how and when these abilities emerge. To address this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind one form of emergence.

Abstract: Designing effective black-box optimizers is hampered by limited problem-specific knowledge and manual control that spans months for almost every detail. In this paper, we present DesignX, the first automated algorithm design framework that generates an effective optimizer specific to a given black-box optimization problem within seconds. Rooted in the first principles, we identify two key sub-tasks: 1) algorithm structure generation and 2) hyperparameter control. To enable systematic construction, a comprehensive modular algorithmic space is first built, embracing hundreds of algorithm components collected from decades of research. We then introduce a dual-agent reinforcement learning system that collaborates on structural and parametric design through a novel cooperative training objective, enabling large-scale meta-training across 10k diverse instances. Remarkably, through days of autonomous learning, the DesignX-generated optimizers continuously surpass human-crafted optimizers by orders of magnitude, either on synthetic testbed or on realistic optimization scenarios such as Protein-docking, AutoML and UAV path planning. Further in-depth analysis reveals DesignX's capability to discover non-trivial algorithm patterns beyond expert intuition, which, conversely, provides valuable design insights for the optimization community. We provide DesignX's inference code at https://github.com/MetaEvo/DesignX.

Abstract: We present the first provable method for identifying symmetric linear dynamical systems (LDS) with accuracy guarantees that are independent of the systems' state dimension or effective memory. Our approach builds upon recent work that represents symmetric LDSs as convolutions learnable via fixed spectral transformations. We show how to invert this representation, thereby recovering an LDS model from its spectral transform and yielding an end-to-end convex optimization procedure. This distillation preserves predictive accuracy while enabling constant-time and constant-space inference per token, independent of sequence length. We evaluate our method, SpectraLDS, as a component in sequence prediction architectures and demonstrate that accuracy is preserved while inference efficiency is improved on tasks such as language modeling.

arXiv:2505.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Best Group Identification problem in a multi-objective multi-armed bandit setting, where an agent interacts with groups of arms with vector-valued rewards. The performance of a group is determined by an efficiency vector which represents the group's best attainable rewards across different dimensions. The objective is to identify the set of optimal groups in the fixed-confidence setting. We investigate two key formulations: group Pareto set identification, where efficiency vectors of optimal groups are Pareto optimal and linear best group identification, where each reward dimension has a known weight and the optimal group maximizes the weighted sum of its efficiency vector's entries. For both settings, we propose elimination-based algorithms, establish upper bounds on their sample complexity, and derive lower bounds that apply to any correct algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the strong empirical performance of the proposed algorithms.

arXiv:2505.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of universal time series forecasting models has revolutionized zero-shot forecasting across diverse domains, yet the critical role of data diversity in training these models remains underexplored. Existing large-scale time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and representative coverage of diverse patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that models pre-trained on BLAST achieve state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the computational resources and training tokens required by existing methods. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of data diversity in improving both training efficiency and model performance for the universal forecasting task.

Abstract: Multi-task forecasting has become the standard approach for time-series forecasting (TSF). However, we show that it suffers from an Expressiveness Bottleneck, where predictions at different time steps share the same representation, leading to unavoidable errors even with optimal representations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework: first, pre-train a foundation model for one-step-ahead prediction; then, adapt it using step-specific LoRA modules.This design enables the foundation model to handle any number of forecast steps while avoiding the expressiveness bottleneck. We further introduce the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLA) model, which employs adaptively weighted LoRA experts to achieve partial parameter sharing across steps. This approach enhances both efficiency and forecasting performance by exploiting interdependencies between forecast steps. Experiments show that MoLA significantly improves model expressiveness and outperforms state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoLA-BC92.

<title>Semi-Supervised Multi-Label Feature Selection with Consistent Sparse Graph Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17875</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical domains, high-dimensional data are usually associated with diverse semantic labels, whereas traditional feature selection methods are designed for single-label data. Moreover, existing multi-label methods encounter two main challenges in semi-supervised scenarios: (1). Most semi-supervised methods fail to evaluate the label correlations without enough labeled samples, which are the critical information of multi-label feature selection, making label-specific features discarded. (2). The similarity graph structure directly derived from the original feature space is suboptimal for multi-label problems in existing graph-based methods, leading to unreliable soft labels and degraded feature selection performance. To overcome them, we propose a consistent sparse graph learning method for multi-label semi-supervised feature selection (SGMFS), which can enhance the feature selection performance by maintaining space consistency and learning label correlations in semi-supervised scenarios. Specifically, for Challenge (1), SGMFS learns a low-dimensional and independent label subspace from the projected features, which can compatibly cross multiple labels and effectively achieve the label correlations. For Challenge (2), instead of constructing a fixed similarity graph for semi-supervised learning, SGMFS thoroughly explores the intrinsic structure of the data by performing sparse reconstruction of samples in both the label space and the learned subspace simultaneously. In this way, the similarity graph can be adaptively learned to maintain the consistency between label space and the learned subspace, which can promote propagating proper soft labels for unlabeled samples, facilitating the ultimate feature selection. An effective solution with fast convergence is designed to optimize the objective function. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGMFS.

Abstract: Concepts such as objects, patterns, and shapes are how humans understand the world. Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not. However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale, high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to 63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.

Abstract: Deep learning models have significantly improved the ability to detect novelties in time series (TS) data. This success is attributed to their strong representation capabilities. However, due to the inherent variability in TS data, these models often struggle with generalization and robustness. To address this, a common approach is to perform Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, particularly Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA), to handle domain shifts and emerging novel classes. While extensively studied in computer vision, UniDA remains underexplored for TS data. This work provides a comprehensive implementation and comparison of state-of-the-art TS backbones in a UniDA framework. We propose a reliable protocol to evaluate their robustness and generalization across different domains. The goal is to provide practitioners with a framework that can be easily extended to incorporate future advancements in UniDA and TS architectures. Our results highlight the critical influence of backbone selection in UniDA performance and enable a robustness analysis across various datasets and architectures.

Abstract: In an era defined by rapid data evolution, traditional machine learning (ML) models often fall short in adapting to dynamic environments. Evolving Machine Learning (EML) has emerged as a critical paradigm, enabling continuous learning and adaptation in real-time data streams. This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of EML, focusing on five core challenges: data drift, concept drift, catastrophic forgetting, skewed learning, and network adaptation. We systematically review over 120 studies, categorizing state-of-the-art methods across supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches. The survey explores diverse evaluation metrics, benchmark datasets, and real-world applications, offering a comparative lens on the effectiveness and limitations of current techniques. Additionally, we highlight the growing role of adaptive neural architectures, meta-learning, and ensemble strategies in addressing evolving data complexities. By synthesizing insights from recent literature, this work not only maps the current landscape of EML but also identifies critical gaps and opportunities for future research. Our findings aim to guide researchers and practitioners in developing robust, ethical, and scalable EML systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Model ensembles have long been a cornerstone for improving generalization and robustness in deep learning. However, their effectiveness often comes at the cost of substantial computational overhead. To address this issue, state-of-the-art methods aim to replicate ensemble-class performance without requiring multiple independently trained networks. Unfortunately, these algorithms often still demand considerable compute at inference. In response to these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{NeuroTrails}$, a sparse multi-head architecture with dynamically evolving topology. This unexplored model-agnostic training paradigm improves ensemble performance while reducing the required resources. We analyze the underlying reason for its effectiveness and observe that the various neural trails induced by dynamic sparsity attain a $\textit{Goldilocks zone}$ of prediction diversity. NeuroTrails displays efficacy with convolutional and transformer-based architectures on computer vision and language tasks. Experiments on ResNet-50/ImageNet, LLaMA-350M/C4, among many others, demonstrate increased accuracy and stronger robustness in zero-shot generalization, while requiring significantly fewer parameters.

<title>LLM Meeting Decision Trees on Tabular Data</title>

Abstract: Tabular data have been playing a vital role in diverse real-world fields, including healthcare, finance, etc. With the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), early explorations of extending LLMs to the domain of tabular data have been developed. Most of these LLM-based methods typically first serialize tabular data into natural language descriptions, and then tune LLMs or directly infer on these serialized data. However, these methods suffer from two key inherent issues: (i) data perspective: existing data serialization methods lack universal applicability for structured tabular data, and may pose privacy risks through direct textual exposure, and (ii) model perspective: LLM fine-tuning methods struggle with tabular data, and in-context learning scalability is bottle-necked by input length constraints (suitable for few-shot learning). This work explores a novel direction of integrating LLMs into tabular data throughough logical decision tree rules as intermediaries, proposes a decision tree enhancer with LLM-derived rule for tabular prediction, DeLTa. The proposed DeLTa avoids tabular data serialization, and can be applied to full data learning setting without LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, we leverage the reasoning ability of LLMs to redesign an improved rule given a set of decision tree rules. Furthermore, we provide a calibration method for original decision trees via new generated rule by LLM, which approximates the error correction vector to steer the original decision tree predictions in the direction of ``errors'' reducing. Finally, extensive experiments on diverse tabular benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Despite the widely recognized success of residual connections in modern neural networks, their design principles remain largely heuristic. This paper introduces KITINet (Kinetics Theory Inspired Network), a novel architecture that reinterprets feature propagation through the lens of non-equilibrium particle dynamics and partial differential equation (PDE) simulation. At its core, we propose a residual module that models feature updates as the stochastic evolution of a particle system, numerically simulated via a discretized solver for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). This formulation mimics particle collisions and energy exchange, enabling adaptive feature refinement via physics-informed interactions. Additionally, we reveal that this mechanism induces network parameter condensation during training, where parameters progressively concentrate into a sparse subset of dominant channels. Experiments on scientific computation (PDE operator), image classification (CIFAR-10/100), and text classification (IMDb/SNLI) show consistent improvements over classic network baselines, with negligible increase of FLOPs.

Abstract: Intensive care unit (ICU) is a crucial hospital department that handles life-threatening cases. Nowadays machine learning (ML) is being leveraged in healthcare ubiquitously. In recent years, management of ICU became one of the most significant parts of the hospital functionality (largely but not only due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic). This study explores multiple ML approaches for predicting LOS in ICU specifically for the patients with neurological diseases based on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The evaluated models include classic ML algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost and CatBoost) and Neural Networks (LSTM, BERT and Temporal Fusion Transformer). Given that LOS prediction is often framed as a classification task, this study categorizes LOS into three groups: less than two days, less than a week, and a week or more. As the first ML-based approach targeting LOS prediction for neurological disorder patients, this study does not aim to outperform existing methods but rather to assess their effectiveness in this specific context. The findings provide insights into the applicability of ML techniques for improving ICU resource management and patient care. According to the results, Random Forest model proved to outperform others on static, achieving an accuracy of 0.68, a precision of 0.68, a recall of 0.68, and F1-score of 0.67. While BERT model outperformed LSTM model on time-series data with an accuracy of 0.80, a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.80 and F1-score 0.80.

Abstract: Interpretability researchers have attempted to understand MLP neurons of language models based on both the contexts in which they activate and their output weight vectors. They have paid little attention to a complementary aspect: the interactions between input and output. For example, when neurons detect a direction in the input, they might add much the same direction to the residual stream ("enrichment neurons") or reduce its presence ("depletion neurons"). We address this aspect by examining the cosine similarity between input and output weights of a neuron. We apply our method to 12 models and find that enrichment neurons dominate in early-middle layers whereas later layers tend more towards depletion. To explain this finding, we argue that enrichment neurons are largely responsible for enriching concept representations, one of the first steps of factual recall. Our input-output perspective is a complement to activation-dependent analyses and to approaches that treat input and output separately.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from pairwise interactions but often overlook multi-way and hierarchical relationships. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this limitation by leveraging combinatorial topological spaces. However, existing TDL models are restricted to undirected settings and fail to capture the higher-order directed patterns prevalent in many complex systems, e.g., brain networks, where such interactions are both abundant and functionally significant. To fill this gap, we introduce Semi-Simplicial Neural Networks (SSNs), a principled class of TDL models that operate on semi-simplicial sets -- combinatorial structures that encode directed higher-order motifs and their directional relationships. To enhance scalability, we propose Routing-SSNs, which dynamically select the most informative relations in a learnable manner. We prove that SSNs are strictly more expressive than standard graph and TDL models. We then introduce a new principled framework for brain dynamics representation learning, grounded in the ability of SSNs to provably recover topological descriptors shown to successfully characterize brain activity. Empirically, SSNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on brain dynamics classification tasks, outperforming the second-best model by up to 27%, and message passing GNNs by up to 50% in accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of principled topological models for learning from structured brain data, establishing a unique real-world case study for TDL. We also test SSNs on standard node classification and edge regression tasks, showing competitive performance. We will make the code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex tasks using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, their tendency to overthinking leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains, dramatically increasing inference costs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriThinker, a novel approach for CoT compression. Unlike conventional methods that fine-tune LRMs directly on the original reasoning task using synthetic concise CoT data, we innovatively fine-tune the model solely through an auxiliary verification task. By training LRMs to accurately verify the correctness of CoT solutions, the LRMs inherently become more discerning about the necessity of subsequent self-reflection steps, thereby effectively suppressing overthinking. Extensive experiments validate that VeriThinker substantially reduces reasoning chain lengths while maintaining or even slightly improving accuracy. When applied to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, our approach reduces reasoning tokens on MATH500 from 3790 to 2125 while improving accuracy by 0.8% (94.0% to 94.8%), and on AIME25, tokens decrease from 14321 to 10287 with a 2.1% accuracy gain (38.7% to 40.8%). Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that VeriThinker can also be zero-shot generalized to speculative reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/VeriThinker

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for training binary and spiking neural networks that achieves state-of-the-art performance without normalisation layers. Unlike commonly used surrogate gradient methods -- often heuristic and sensitive to hyperparameter choices -- our approach is grounded in a probabilistic model of noisy binary networks, enabling fully end-to-end gradient-based optimisation. We introduce importance-weighted straight-through (IW-ST) estimators, a unified class generalising straight-through and relaxation-based estimators. We characterise the bias-variance trade-off in this family and derive a bias-minimising objective implemented via an auxiliary loss. Building on this, we introduce Spiking Bayesian Neural Networks (SBNNs), a variational inference framework that uses posterior noise to train Binary and Spiking Neural Networks with IW-ST. This Bayesian approach minimises gradient bias, regularises parameters, and introduces dropout-like noise. By linking low-bias conditions, vanishing gradients, and the KL term, we enable training of deep residual networks without normalisation. Experiments on CIFAR-10, DVS Gesture, and SHD show our method matches or exceeds existing approaches without normalisation or hand-tuned gradients.

<title>SVD-Free Low-Rank Adaptive Gradient Optimization for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). However, applying SVD-based procedures individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple two-step procedure to approximate SVD-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces. First, we construct a complete orthogonal basis using predefined orthogonal matrices of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Second, we adaptively select basis columns based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. Each projection matrix in our method is obtained via a single matrix multiplication followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. During training, we store only the indices of the selected columns, avoiding the need to store full projection matrices for each layer. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, matching the performance of costly SVD-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage.

<title>Are Large Language Models Reliable AI Scientists? Assessing Reverse-Engineering of Black-Box Systems</title>

Abstract: Using AI to create autonomous researchers has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery. A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well an AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from its behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM) learns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively collected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs across three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent different problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have considerable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through extensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from observations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of Bayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only observe but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific inputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs to test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data from one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of engaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling results in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that engaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes: overcomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the black-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations. These insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively reverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new discoveries.

<title>Generalized Fisher-Weighted SVD: Scalable Kronecker-Factored Fisher Approximation for Compressing Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2505.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher information is a fundamental concept for characterizing the sensitivity of parameters in neural networks. However, leveraging the full observed Fisher information is too expensive for large models, so most methods rely on simple diagonal approximations. While efficient, this approach ignores parameter correlations, often resulting in reduced performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we mitigate these limitations and propose Generalized Fisher-Weighted SVD (GFWSVD), a post-training LLM compression technique that accounts for both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the Fisher information matrix, providing a more accurate reflection of parameter importance. To make the method tractable, we introduce a scalable adaptation of the Kronecker-factored approximation algorithm for the observed Fisher information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LLM compression, showing improvements over existing compression baselines. For example, at a 20 compression rate on the MMLU benchmark, our method outperforms FWSVD, which is based on a diagonal approximation of the Fisher information, by 5 percent, SVD-LLM by 3 percent, and ASVD by 6 percent compression rate.

Abstract: Real world collection of Activities of Daily Living data is challenging due to privacy concerns, costly deployment and labeling, and the inherent sparsity and imbalance of human behavior. We present ADLGen, a generative framework specifically designed to synthesize realistic, event triggered, and symbolic sensor sequences for ambient assistive environments. ADLGen integrates a decoder only Transformer with sign based symbolic temporal encoding, and a context and layout aware sampling mechanism to guide generation toward semantically rich and physically plausible sensor event sequences. To enhance semantic fidelity and correct structural inconsistencies, we further incorporate a large language model into an automatic generate evaluate refine loop, which verifies logical, behavioral, and temporal coherence and generates correction rules without manual intervention or environment specific tuning. Through comprehensive experiments with novel evaluation metrics, ADLGen is shown to outperform baseline generators in statistical fidelity, semantic richness, and downstream activity recognition, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for ADL data synthesis.

<title>Towards Revealing the Effectiveness of Small-Scale Fine-tuning in R1-style Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: R1-style Reinforcement Learning (RL) significantly enhances Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanism behind rule-based RL remains unclear. We found that small-scale SFT has significant influence on RL but shows poor efficiency. To explain our observations, we propose an analytical framework and compare the efficiency of SFT and RL by measuring sample effect. Hypothetical analysis show that SFT efficiency is limited by training data. Guided by our analysis, we propose Re-distillation, a technique that fine-tunes pretrain model through small-scale distillation from the RL-trained policy. Experiments on Knight & Knave and MATH datasets demonstrate re-distillation's surprising efficiency: re-distilled models match RL performance with far fewer samples and less computation. Empirical verification shows that sample effect is a good indicator of performance improvements. As a result, on K&amp;K dataset, our re-distilled Qwen2.5-1.5B model surpasses DeepSeek-V3-0324 with only 1K SFT samples. On MATH, Qwen2.5-1.5B fine-tuned with re-distilled 500 samples matches its instruct-tuned variant without RL. Our work explains several interesting phenomena in R1-style RL, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its empirical success. Code is available at: https://github.com/on1262/deep-reasoning

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has boosted math and coding in large language models, yet there has been little effort to extend RLVR into messier, real-world domains like forecasting. One sticking point is that outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from binary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is brittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match frontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical prediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our adaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply baseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally consistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that penalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a single stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and ensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline o1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in calibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this calibration edge into \$127 of hypothetical profit versus \$92 for o1 (p = 0.037). This demonstrates that refined RLVR methods can convert small-scale LLMs into potentially economically valuable forecasting tools, with implications for scaling this to larger models.

Abstract: The VAPO framework has demonstrated significant empirical success in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of reinforcement learning for long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). By systematically addressing challenges such as value model bias, heterogeneous sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, VAPO achieves state-of-the-art performance. While its practical benefits are evident, a deeper theoretical understanding of its underlying mechanisms and potential limitations is crucial for guiding future advancements. This paper aims to initiate such a discussion by exploring VAPO from a theoretical perspective, highlighting areas where its assumptions might be challenged and where further investigation could yield more robust and generalizable reasoning agents. We delve into the intricacies of value function approximation in complex reasoning spaces, the optimality of adaptive advantage estimation, the impact of token-level optimization, and the enduring challenges of exploration and generalization.

<title>Rethinking Contrastive Learning in Graph Anomaly Detection: A Clean-View Perspective</title>

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in graph-based data, with wide applications in fields such as web security and financial fraud detection. Existing methods typically rely on contrastive learning, assuming that a lower similarity between a node and its local subgraph indicates abnormality. However, these approaches overlook a crucial limitation: the presence of interfering edges invalidates this assumption, since it introduces disruptive noise that compromises the contrastive learning process. Consequently, this limitation impairs the ability to effectively learn meaningful representations of normal patterns, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a Clean-View Enhanced Graph Anomaly Detection framework (CVGAD), which includes a multi-scale anomaly awareness module to identify key sources of interference in the contrastive learning process. Moreover, to mitigate bias from the one-step edge removal process, we introduce a novel progressive purification module. This module incrementally refines the graph by iteratively identifying and removing interfering edges, thereby enhancing model performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Existing evaluations of AI misuse safeguards provide a patchwork of evidence that is often difficult to connect to real-world decisions. To bridge this gap, we describe an end-to-end argument (a "safety case") that misuse safeguards reduce the risk posed by an AI assistant to low levels. We first describe how a hypothetical developer red teams safeguards, estimating the effort required to evade them. Then, the developer plugs this estimate into a quantitative "uplift model" to determine how much barriers introduced by safeguards dissuade misuse (https://www.aimisusemodel.com/). This procedure provides a continuous signal of risk during deployment that helps the developer rapidly respond to emerging threats. Finally, we describe how to tie these components together into a simple safety case. Our work provides one concrete path -- though not the only path -- to rigorously justifying AI misuse risks are low.

Abstract: Bisimulation metrics are powerful tools for measuring similarities between stochastic processes, and specifically Markov chains. Recent advances have uncovered that bisimulation metrics are, in fact, optimal-transport distances, which has enabled the development of fast algorithms for computing such metrics with provable accuracy and runtime guarantees. However, these recent methods, as well as all previously known methods, assume full knowledge of the transition dynamics. This is often an impractical assumption in most real-world scenarios, where typically only sample trajectories are available. In this work, we propose a stochastic optimization method that addresses this limitation and estimates bisimulation metrics based on sample access, without requiring explicit transition models. Our approach is derived from a new linear programming (LP) formulation of bisimulation metrics, which we solve using a stochastic primal-dual optimization method. We provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity of the algorithm and validate its effectiveness through a series of empirical evaluations.

Abstract: Deep generative models hold great promise for representing complex physical systems, but their deployment is currently limited by the lack of guarantees on the physical plausibility of the generated outputs. Ensuring that known physical constraints are enforced is therefore critical when applying generative models to scientific and engineering problems. We address this limitation by developing a principled framework for sampling from a target distribution while rigorously satisfying physical constraints. Leveraging the variational formulation of Langevin dynamics, we propose Split Augmented Langevin (SAL), a novel primal-dual sampling algorithm that enforces constraints progressively through variable splitting, with convergence guarantees. While the method is developed theoretically for Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate its effective applicability to diffusion models. In particular, we use constrained diffusion models to generate physical fields satisfying energy and mass conservation laws. We apply our method to diffusion-based data assimilation on a complex physical system, where enforcing physical constraints substantially improves both forecast accuracy and the preservation of critical conserved quantities. We also demonstrate the potential of SAL for challenging feasibility problems in optimal control.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in developing spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a potential solution to the energy challenges posed by conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, our theoretical understanding of SNNs remains relatively limited compared to the ever-growing body of literature on ANNs. In this paper, we study a discrete-time model of SNNs based on leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, referred to as discrete-time LIF-SNNs, a widely used framework that still lacks solid theoretical foundations. We demonstrate that discrete-time LIF-SNNs with static inputs and outputs realize piecewise constant functions defined on polyhedral regions, and more importantly, we quantify the network size required to approximate continuous functions. Moreover, we investigate the impact of latency (number of time steps) and depth (number of layers) on the complexity of the input space partitioning induced by discrete-time LIF-SNNs. Our analysis highlights the importance of latency and contrasts these networks with ANNs employing piecewise linear activation functions. Finally, we present numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We propose KnotGym, an interactive environment for complex, spatial reasoning and manipulation. KnotGym includes goal-oriented rope manipulation tasks with varying levels of complexity, all requiring acting from pure image observations. Tasks are defined along a clear and quantifiable axis of complexity based on the number of knot crossings, creating a natural generalization test. KnotGym has a simple observation space, allowing for scalable development, yet it highlights core challenges in integrating acute perception, spatial reasoning, and grounded manipulation. We evaluate methods of different classes, including model-based RL, model-predictive control, and chain-of-thought reasoning, and illustrate the challenges KnotGym presents. KnotGym is available at https://github.com/lil-lab/knotgym.

<title>Mahalanobis++: Improving OOD Detection via Feature Normalization</title>

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is an important task for deploying reliable machine learning models in safety-critial applications. While post-hoc methods based on the Mahalanobis distance applied to pre-logit features are among the most effective for ImageNet-scale OOD detection, their performance varies significantly across models. We connect this inconsistency to strong variations in feature norms, indicating severe violations of the Gaussian assumption underlying the Mahalanobis distance estimation. We show that simple $\ell_2$-normalization of the features mitigates this problem effectively, aligning better with the premise of normally distributed data with shared covariance matrix. Extensive experiments on 44 models across diverse architectures and pretraining schemes show that $\ell_2$-normalization improves the conventional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches significantly and consistently, and outperforms other recently proposed OOD detection methods.

<title>Improved Algorithms for Overlapping and Robust Clustering of Edge-Colored Hypergraphs: An LP-Based Combinatorial Approach</title>

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in both machine learning and data mining. Among various methods, edge-colored clustering (ECC) has emerged as a useful approach for handling categorical data. Given a hypergraph with (hyper)edges labeled by colors, ECC aims to assign vertex colors to minimize the number of edges where the vertex color differs from the edge's color. However, traditional ECC has inherent limitations, as it enforces a nonoverlapping and exhaustive clustering. To tackle these limitations, three versions of ECC have been studied: Local ECC and Global ECC, which allow overlapping clusters, and Robust ECC, which accounts for vertex outliers. For these problems, both linear programming (LP) rounding algorithms and greedy combinatorial algorithms have been proposed. While these LP-rounding algorithms provide high-quality solutions, they demand substantial computation time; the greedy algorithms, on the other hand, run very fast but often compromise solution quality. In this paper, we present an algorithmic framework that combines the strengths of LP with the computational efficiency of combinatorial algorithms. Both experimental and theoretical analyses show that our algorithms efficiently produce high-quality solutions for all three problems: Local, Global, and Robust ECC. We complement our algorithmic contributions with complexity-theoretic inapproximability results and integrality gap bounds, which suggest that significant theoretical improvements are unlikely. Our results also answer two open questions previously raised in the literature.

<title>Linear Mixture Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems face the off-dynamics challenge: the agent learns a policy in a source domain and deploys it in a target domain with different state transitions. The distributionally robust Markov decision process (DRMDP) addresses this challenge by finding a robust policy that performs well under the worst-case environment within a pre-specified uncertainty set of transition dynamics. Its effectiveness heavily hinges on the proper design of these uncertainty sets, based on prior knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel linear mixture DRMDP framework, where the nominal dynamics is assumed to be a linear mixture model. In contrast with existing uncertainty sets directly defined as a ball centered around the nominal kernel, linear mixture DRMDPs define the uncertainty sets based on a ball around the mixture weighting parameter. We show that this new framework provides a more refined representation of uncertainties compared to conventional models based on $(s,a)$-rectangularity and $d$-rectangularity, when prior knowledge about the mixture model is present. We propose a meta algorithm for robust policy learning in linear mixture DRMDPs with general $f$-divergence defined uncertainty sets, and analyze its sample complexities under three divergence metrics instantiations: total variation, Kullback-Leibler, and $\chi^2$ divergences. These results establish the statistical learnability of linear mixture DRMDPs, laying the theoretical foundation for future research on this new setting.

<title>Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Asymptotics of AMP and GD in High Dimensions</title>

Abstract: The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is one of the simplest generative neural networks capable of learning input distributions. Despite its simplicity, the analysis of its performance in learning from the training data is only well understood in cases that essentially reduce to singular value decomposition of the data. Here, we consider the limit of a large dimension of the input space and a constant number of hidden units. In this limit, we simplify the standard RBM training objective into a form that is equivalent to the multi-index model with non-separable regularization. This opens a path to analyze training of the RBM using methods that are established for multi-index models, such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and its state evolution, and the analysis of Gradient Descent (GD) via the dynamical mean-field theory. We then give rigorous asymptotics of the training dynamics of RBM on data generated by the spiked covariance model as a prototype of a structure suitable for unsupervised learning. We show in particular that RBM reaches the optimal computational weak recovery threshold, aligning with the BBP transition, in the spiked covariance model.

<title>Asymptotically optimal regret in communicating Markov decision processes</title>

arXiv:2505.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that achieves asymptotically optimal regret for Markov decision processes in average reward under a communicating assumption. That is, given a communicating Markov decision process $M$, our algorithm has regret $K(M) \log(T) + \mathrm{o}(\log(T))$ where $T$ is the number of learning steps and $K(M)$ is the best possible constant. This algorithm works by explicitly tracking the constant $K(M)$ to learn optimally, then balances the trade-off between exploration (playing sub-optimally to gain information), co-exploration (playing optimally to gain information) and exploitation (playing optimally to score maximally). We further show that the function $K(M)$ is discontinuous, which is a consequence challenge for our approach. To that end, we describe a regularization mechanism to estimate $K(M)$ with arbitrary precision from empirical data.

Abstract: External test-time reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by decoupling generation and selection. At inference time, the model generates multiple reasoning paths, and an auxiliary process reward model (PRM) is used to score and select the best one. A central challenge in this setting is test-time compute optimality (TCO), i.e., how to maximize answer accuracy under a fixed inference budget. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to analyze how the generalization error of the PRM affects compute efficiency and reasoning performance. Leveraging PAC-Bayes theory, we derive generalization bounds and show that a lower generalization error of PRM leads to fewer samples required to find correct answers. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Compute-Aware Tree Search (CATS), an actor-critic framework that dynamically controls search behavior. The actor outputs sampling hyperparameters based on reward distributions and sparsity statistics, while the critic estimates their utility to guide budget allocation. Experiments on the MATH and AIME benchmarks with various LLMs and PRMs demonstrate that CATS consistently outperforms other external TTS methods, validating our theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has emerged as a remarkably effective learning algorithm, underpinning nearly all state-of-the-art machine learning models, from large language models to autonomous vehicles. Despite its practical success, SGD appears fundamentally distinct from biological learning mechanisms. It is widely believed that the biological brain can not implement gradient descent because it is nonlocal, and we have found little (if any) experimental evidence for it. In contrast, the brain is widely thought to learn via local Hebbian learning principles, which have been seen as incompatible with gradient descent. In this paper, we establish a theoretical and empirical connection between the learning signals of neural networks trained using SGD with weight decay and those trained with Hebbian learning near convergence. We show that SGD with regularization can appear to learn according to a Hebbian rule, and SGD with injected noise according to an anti-Hebbian rule. We also provide empirical evidence that Hebbian learning properties can emerge in a network with weight decay from virtually any learning rule--even random ones. These results may bridge a long-standing gap between artificial and biological learning, revealing Hebbian properties as an epiphenomenon of deeper optimization principles and cautioning against interpreting their presence in neural data as evidence against more complex hetero-synaptic mechanisms.

arXiv:2505.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents AFD-STA Net, a neural framework integrating adaptive filtering and spatiotemporal dynamics learning for predicting high-dimensional chaotic systems governed by partial differential equations. The architecture combines: 1) An adaptive exponential smoothing module with position-aware decay coefficients for robust attractor reconstruction, 2) Parallel attention mechanisms capturing cross-temporal and spatial dependencies, 3) Dynamic gated fusion of multiscale features, and 4) Deep projection networks with dimension-scaling capabilities. Numerical experiments on nonlinear PDE systems demonstrate the model's effectiveness in maintaining prediction accuracy under both smooth and strongly chaotic regimes while exhibiting noise tolerance through adaptive filtering. Component ablation studies confirm critical contributions from each module, particularly highlighting the essential role of spatiotemporal attention in learning complex dynamical interactions. The framework shows promising potential for real-world applications requiring simultaneous handling of measurement uncertainties and high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Recent work on backpropagation-free learning has shown that it is possible to use forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) to perform optimization on differentiable models. Forward-mode AD requires sampling a tangent vector for each forward pass of a model. The result is the model evaluation with the directional derivative along the tangent. In this paper, we illustrate how the sampling of this tangent vector can be incorporated into the proposal mechanism for the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). As such, we are the first to introduce a backpropagation-free gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We also extend to a novel backpropagation-free position-specific preconditioned forward-mode MALA that leverages Hessian information. Overall, we propose four new algorithms: Forward MALA; Line Forward MALA; Pre-conditioned Forward MALA, and Pre-conditioned Line Forward MALA. We highlight the reduced computational cost of the forward-mode samplers and show that forward-mode is competitive with the original MALA, while even outperforming it depending on the probabilistic model. We include Bayesian inference results on a range of probabilistic models, including hierarchical distributions and Bayesian neural networks.

Abstract: The techniques of data-driven backmapping from coarse-grained (CG) to fine-grained (FG) representation often struggle with accuracy, unstable training, and physical realism, especially when applied to complex systems such as proteins. In this work, we introduce a novel iterative framework by using conditional Variational Autoencoders and graph-based neural networks, specifically designed to tackle the challenges associated with such large-scale biomolecules. Our method enables stepwise refinement from CG beads to full atomistic details. We outline the theory of iterative generative backmapping and demonstrate via numerical experiments the advantages of multistep schemes by applying them to proteins of vastly different structures with very coarse representations. This multistep approach not only improves the accuracy of reconstructions but also makes the training process more computationally efficient for proteins with ultra-CG representations.

<title>What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Stitching in Diffusion Planning?</title>

Abstract: In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.

Abstract: Early-exit mechanisms allow deep neural networks to halt inference as soon as classification confidence is high enough, adaptively trading depth for confidence, and thereby cutting latency and energy on easy inputs while retaining full-depth accuracy for harder ones. Similarly, adding early exit mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder and more complex graphs to capture intricate relationships. Although early exits have proven effective across various deep learning domains, their potential within GNNs in scenarios that require deep architectures while resisting over-smoothing and over-squashing remains largely unexplored. We unlock that potential by first introducing Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric Graph Neural Networks (SAS-GNN), whose symmetry-based inductive biases mitigate these issues and yield stable intermediate representations that can be useful to allow early exiting in GNNs. Building on this backbone, we present Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks (EEGNNs), which append confidence-aware exit heads that allow on-the-fly termination of propagation based on each node or the entire graph. Experiments show that EEGNNs preserve robust performance as depth grows and deliver competitive accuracy on heterophilic and long-range benchmarks, matching attention-based and asynchronous message-passing models while substantially reducing computation and latency. We plan to release the code to reproduce our experiments.

<title>Data Mixing Can Induce Phase Transitions in Knowledge Acquisition</title>

arXiv:2505.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data (arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not be optimal for small models, and vice versa.

<title>Towards more transferable adversarial attack in black-box manner</title>

arXiv:2505.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition, reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.

arXiv:2505.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Continual Learning (OCL) presents a complex learning environment in which new data arrives in a batch-to-batch online format, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting can significantly impair model efficacy. In this study, we address OCL by introducing an innovative memory framework that incorporates a short-term memory system to retain dynamic information and a long-term memory system to archive enduring knowledge. Specifically, the long-term memory system comprises a collection of sub-memory buffers, each linked to a cluster prototype and designed to retain data samples from distinct categories. We propose a novel $K$-means-based sample selection method to identify cluster prototypes for each encountered category. To safeguard essential and critical samples, we introduce a novel memory optimisation strategy that selectively retains samples in the appropriate sub-memory buffer by evaluating each cluster prototype against incoming samples through an optimal transportation mechanism. This approach specifically promotes each sub-memory buffer to retain data samples that exhibit significant discrepancies from the corresponding cluster prototype, thereby ensuring the preservation of semantically rich information. In addition, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer (DAC) approach that formulates the memory updating as an optimisation problem and divides it into several subproblems. As a result, the proposed DAC approach can solve these subproblems separately and thus can significantly reduce computations of the proposed memory updating process. We conduct a series of experiments across standard and imbalanced learning settings, and the empirical findings indicate that the proposed memory framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both learning contexts.

<title>How Can I Publish My LLM Benchmark Without Giving the True Answers Away?</title>

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.

<title>Beyond Discreteness: Finite-Sample Analysis of Straight-Through Estimator for Quantization</title>

Abstract: Training quantized neural networks requires addressing the non-differentiable and discrete nature of the underlying optimization problem. To tackle this challenge, the straight-through estimator (STE) has become the most widely adopted heuristic, allowing backpropagation through discrete operations by introducing surrogate gradients. However, its theoretical properties remain largely unexplored, with few existing works simplifying the analysis by assuming an infinite amount of training data. In contrast, this work presents the first finite-sample analysis of STE in the context of neural network quantization. Our theoretical results highlight the critical role of sample size in the success of STE, a key insight absent from existing studies. Specifically, by analyzing the quantization-aware training of a two-layer neural network with binary weights and activations, we derive the sample complexity bound in terms of the data dimensionality that guarantees the convergence of STE-based optimization to the global minimum. Moreover, in the presence of label noises, we uncover an intriguing recurrence property of STE-gradient method, where the iterate repeatedly escape from and return to the optimal binary weights. Our analysis leverages tools from compressed sensing and dynamical systems theory.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers. In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers, NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning, matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it has historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain dominated by gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). However, recent advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets, particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further performance improvements.

<title>Reward Model Overoptimisation in Iterated RLHF</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

<title>Leveraging KANs for Expedient Training of Multichannel MLPs via Preconditioning and Geometric Refinement</title>

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are a workhorse machine learning architecture, used in a variety of modern deep learning frameworks. However, recently Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have become increasingly popular due to their success on a range of problems, particularly for scientific machine learning tasks. In this paper, we exploit the relationship between KANs and multichannel MLPs to gain structural insight into how to train MLPs faster. We demonstrate the KAN basis (1) provides geometric localized support, and (2) acts as a preconditioned descent in the ReLU basis, overall resulting in expedited training and improved accuracy. Our results show the equivalence between free-knot spline KAN architectures, and a class of MLPs that are refined geometrically along the channel dimension of each weight tensor. We exploit this structural equivalence to define a hierarchical refinement scheme that dramatically accelerates training of the multi-channel MLP architecture. We show further accuracy improvements can be had by allowing the $1$D locations of the spline knots to be trained simultaneously with the weights. These advances are demonstrated on a range of benchmark examples for regression and scientific machine learning.

<title>Generative Distribution Embeddings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world problems require reasoning across multiple scales, demanding models which operate not on single data points, but on entire distributions. We introduce generative distribution embeddings (GDE), a framework that lifts autoencoders to the space of distributions. In GDEs, an encoder acts on sets of samples, and the decoder is replaced by a generator which aims to match the input distribution. This framework enables learning representations of distributions by coupling conditional generative models with encoder networks which satisfy a criterion we call distributional invariance. We show that GDEs learn predictive sufficient statistics embedded in the Wasserstein space, such that latent GDE distances approximately recover the $W_2$ distance, and latent interpolation approximately recovers optimal transport trajectories for Gaussian and Gaussian mixture distributions. We systematically benchmark GDEs against existing approaches on synthetic datasets, demonstrating consistently stronger performance. We then apply GDEs to six key problems in computational biology: learning representations of cell populations from lineage-tracing data (150K cells), predicting perturbation effects on single-cell transcriptomes (1M cells), predicting perturbation effects on cellular phenotypes (20M single-cell images), modeling tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns (253M sequences), designing synthetic yeast promoters (34M sequences), and spatiotemporal modeling of viral protein sequences (1M sequences).

Abstract: To better handle real-world uncertainty, concepts such as fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, and soft sets have been introduced. For example, neutrosophic sets, which simultaneously represent truth, indeterminacy, and falsehood, have proven to be valuable tools for modeling uncertainty in complex systems. These set concepts are increasingly studied in graphized forms, and generalized graph concepts now encompass well-known structures such as hypergraphs and superhypergraphs. Furthermore, hyperconcepts and superhyperconcepts are being actively researched in areas beyond graph theory.
  Combinatorics, uncertain sets (including fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, soft sets, and plithogenic sets), uncertain graphs, and hyper and superhyper concepts are active areas of research with significant mathematical and practical implications. Recognizing their importance, this paper explores new graph and set concepts, as well as hyper and superhyper concepts, as detailed in the "Results" section of "The Structure of the Paper." Additionally, this work aims to consolidate recent findings, providing a survey-like resource to inform and engage readers.
  For instance, we extend several graph concepts by introducing Neutrosophic Oversets, Neutrosophic Undersets, Neutrosophic Offsets, and the Nonstandard Real Set. This paper defines a variety of concepts with the goal of inspiring new ideas and serving as a valuable resource for researchers in their academic pursuits.

<title>Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment Protocol for Semantic Communication in AI Agent Networks</title>

Abstract: Future networks are envisioned to connect massive artificial intelligence (AI) agents, enabling their extensive collaboration on diverse tasks. Compared to traditional entities, these agents naturally suit the semantic communication (SC), which can significantly enhance the bandwidth efficiency. Nevertheless, SC requires the knowledge among agents to be aligned, while agents have distinct expert knowledge for their individual tasks in practice. In this paper, we propose a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment protocol (DeKAP), which distills the expert knowledge of each agent into parameter-efficient low-rank matrices, allocates them across the network, and allows agents to simultaneously maintain aligned knowledge for multiple tasks. We formulate the joint minimization of alignment loss, communication overhead, and storage cost as a large-scale integer linear programming problem and develop a highly efficient greedy algorithm. From computer simulation, the DeKAP establishes knowledge alignment with the lowest communication and computation resources compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant challenges for numerical computation due to the curse of dimensionality, which limits the applicability of traditional mesh-based methods. Since 2017, the Deep BSDE method has introduced deep learning techniques that enable the effective solution of nonlinear PDEs in very high dimensions. This innovation has sparked considerable interest in using neural networks for high-dimensional PDEs, making it an active area of research. In this short review, we briefly sketch the Deep BSDE method, its subsequent developments, and future directions for the field.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation, excelling at instruction following and structured output generation. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in radiology, serving as valuable sources of factual information and enhancing various downstream tasks. However, generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs presents significant challenges due to the specialized language of radiology reports and the limited availability of domain-specific data. Existing solutions are predominantly unimodal, meaning they generate knowledge graphs only from radiology reports while excluding radiographic images. Additionally, they struggle with long-form radiology data due to limited context length. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal VLM-based framework for knowledge graph generation in radiology. Our approach outperforms previous methods and introduces the first multimodal solution for radiology knowledge graph generation.

Abstract: Accurately solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational mathematics. Traditional numerical methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often struggle to deliver the precision required in practical applications. Recent machine learning-based approaches offer flexibility but frequently fall short in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in industrial contexts. In this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework, combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and reduced training time.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures have revolutionised natural language processing, but their application to healthcare domains presents unique challenges. Patient timelines are characterised by irregular sampling, variable temporal dependencies, and complex contextual relationships that differ substantially from traditional language tasks. This paper introduces \METHOD~(Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery), a novel transformer architecture specifically designed to address the challenges of clinical sequence modelling in electronic health records. \METHOD~integrates three key innovations: (1) a patient-aware attention mechanism that prevents information leakage whilst enabling efficient batch processing; (2) an adaptive sliding window attention scheme that captures multi-scale temporal dependencies; and (3) a U-Net inspired architecture with dynamic skip connections for effective long sequence processing. Evaluations on the MIMIC-IV database demonstrate that \METHOD~consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art \ETHOS~model, particularly in predicting high-severity cases that require urgent clinical intervention. \METHOD~exhibits stable performance across varying inference lengths, a crucial feature for clinical deployment where patient histories vary significantly in length. Analysis of learned embeddings reveals that \METHOD~better preserves clinical hierarchies and relationships between medical concepts. These results suggest that \METHOD~represents a significant advancement in transformer architectures optimised for healthcare applications, providing more accurate and clinically relevant predictions whilst maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to adapt foundation models to specialized tasks, but its reliance on large-scale human-labeled data limits broad adoption. We introduce Synthetic Data RL, a simple and general framework that reinforcement fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a task definition. Our method first generates question and answer pairs from the task definition and retrieved documents, then adapts the difficulty of the question based on model solvability, and selects questions using the average pass rate of the model across samples for RL training. On Qwen-2.5-7B, our method achieves a 29.2% absolute improvement over the base model on GSM8K (+2.9 pp vs. instruction-tuned, +6.6 pp vs. Self-Instruct), 8.7% on MATH, 13.1% on GPQA (+7.0 pp vs. SynthLLM), 8.9% on MedQA, 17.7% on CQA (law) and 13.7% on CFA (finance). It surpasses supervised fine-tuning under the same data budget and nearly matches RL with full human data across datasets (e.g., +17.2 pp on GSM8K). Adding 100 human demonstrations improves the performance of GSM8K only by 0.4 pp, showing a limited added value. By reducing human data annotation, Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient RL-based model adaptation. Code and demos are available at https://github.com/gydpku/Data_Synthesis_RL/.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models LLMs, have shown promising capabilities in transforming rare disease research. This survey paper explores the integration of LLMs in the analysis of rare diseases, highlighting significant strides and pivotal studies that leverage textual data to uncover insights and patterns critical for diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. While current research predominantly employs textual data, the potential for multimodal data integration combining genetic, imaging, and electronic health records stands as a promising frontier. We review foundational papers that demonstrate the application of LLMs in identifying and extracting relevant medical information, simulating intelligent conversational agents for patient interaction, and enabling the formulation of accurate and timely diagnoses. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges and ethical considerations inherent in deploying LLMs, including data privacy, model transparency, and the need for robust, inclusive data sets. As part of this exploration, we present a section on experimentation that utilizes multiple LLMs alongside structured questionnaires, specifically designed for diagnostic purposes in the context of different diseases. We conclude with future perspectives on the evolution of LLMs towards truly multimodal platforms, which would integrate diverse data types to provide a more comprehensive understanding of rare diseases, ultimately fostering better outcomes in clinical settings.

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

Abstract: In health-related topics, user toxicity in online discussions frequently becomes a source of social conflict or promotion of dangerous, unscientific behaviour; common approaches for battling it include different forms of detection, flagging and/or removal of existing toxic comments, which is often counterproductive for platforms and users alike. In this work, we propose the alternative of combatting user toxicity predictively, anticipating where a user could interact toxically in health-related online discussions. Applying a Collaborative Filtering-based Machine Learning methodology, we predict the toxicity in COVID-related conversations between any user and subcommunity of Reddit, surpassing 80% predictive performance in relevant metrics, and allowing us to prevent the pairing of conflicting users and subcommunities.

<title>Safety Alignment Can Be Not Superficial With Explicit Safety Signals</title>

Abstract: Recent studies on the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) have revealed that existing approaches often operate superficially, leaving models vulnerable to various adversarial attacks. Despite their significance, these studies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation for achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often presume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during the alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the learned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading models to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when confronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly introducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its signals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity and allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize that, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess the safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each necessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial attacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research seeks to reveal the inner workings of large language models, yet most work focuses on classification or generative tasks rather than summarization. This paper presents an interpretability framework for analyzing how GPT-like models adapt to summarization tasks. We conduct differential analysis between pre-trained and fine-tuned models, quantifying changes in attention patterns and internal activations. By identifying specific layers and attention heads that undergo significant transformation, we locate the "summarization circuit" within the model architecture. Our findings reveal that middle layers (particularly 2, 3, and 5) exhibit the most dramatic changes, with 62% of attention heads showing decreased entropy, indicating a shift toward focused information selection. We demonstrate that targeted LoRA adaptation of these identified circuits achieves significant performance improvement over standard LoRA fine-tuning while requiring fewer training epochs. This work bridges the gap between black-box evaluation and mechanistic understanding, providing insights into how neural networks perform information selection and compression during summarization.

<title>Semi-Clairvoyant Scheduling of Speculative Decoding Requests to Minimize LLM Inference Latency</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by employing a small speculative model (SSM) to generate multiple candidate tokens and verify them using the LLM in parallel. This technique has been widely integrated into LLM inference serving systems. However, inference requests typically exhibit uncertain execution time, which poses a significant challenge of efficiently scheduling requests in these systems. Existing work estimates execution time based solely on predicted output length, which could be inaccurate because execution time depends on both output length and token acceptance rate of verification by the LLM. In this paper, we propose a semi-clairvoyant request scheduling algorithm called Least-Attained/Perceived-Service for Speculative Decoding (LAPS-SD). Given a number of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average inference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features during decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time is difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows request execution preemption across different queues. Once the token acceptance rate becomes stable, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate the execution time and schedule requests accordingly. Extensive experiments show that LAPS-SD reduces inference latency by approximately 39\% compared to state-of-the-art scheduling methods.

<title>Streamlining HTTP Flooding Attack Detection through Incremental Feature Selection</title>

Abstract: Applications over the Web primarily rely on the HTTP protocol to transmit web pages to and from systems. There are a variety of application layer protocols, but among all, HTTP is the most targeted because of its versatility and ease of integration with online services. The attackers leverage the fact that by default no detection system blocks any HTTP traffic. Thus, by exploiting such characteristics of the protocol, attacks are launched against web applications. HTTP flooding attacks are one such attack in the application layer of the OSI model. In this paper, a method for the detection of such an attack is proposed. The heart of the detection method is an incremental feature subset selection method based on mutual information and correlation. INFS-MICC helps in identifying a subset of highly relevant and independent feature subset so as to detect HTTP Flooding attacks with best possible classification performance in near-real time.

Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption, we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.

Abstract: This chapter explores the evolution, classification, and health implications of food processing, while emphasizing the transformative role of machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and data science in advancing food informatics. It begins with a historical overview and a critical review of traditional classification frameworks such as NOVA, Nutri-Score, and SIGA, highlighting their strengths and limitations, particularly the subjectivity and reproducibility challenges that hinder epidemiological research and public policy. To address these issues, the chapter presents novel computational approaches, including FoodProX, a random forest model trained on nutrient composition data to infer processing levels and generate a continuous FPro score. It also explores how large language models like BERT and BioBERT can semantically embed food descriptions and ingredient lists for predictive tasks, even in the presence of missing data.

Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Abstract: Secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows data owners to train machine learning models on combined data while keeping the underlying training data private. The MPC threat model either considers an adversary who passively corrupts some parties without affecting their overall behavior, or an adversary who actively modifies the behavior of corrupt parties. It has been argued that in some settings, active security is not a major concern, partly because of the potential risk of reputation loss if a party is detected cheating.
  In this work we show explicit, simple, and effective attacks that an active adversary can run on existing passively secure MPC training protocols, while keeping essentially zero risk of the attack being detected. The attacks we show can compromise both the integrity and privacy of the model, including attacks reconstructing exact training data. Our results challenge the belief that a threat model that does not include malicious behavior by the involved parties may be reasonable in the context of PPML, motivating the use of actively secure protocols for training.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the human brain's neural architecture, is revolutionizing artificial intelligence and edge computing with its low-power, adaptive, and event-driven designs. However, these unique characteristics introduce novel cybersecurity risks. This paper proposes Neuromorphic Mimicry Attacks (NMAs), a groundbreaking class of threats that exploit the probabilistic and non-deterministic nature of neuromorphic chips to execute covert intrusions. By mimicking legitimate neural activity through techniques such as synaptic weight tampering and sensory input poisoning, NMAs evade traditional intrusion detection systems, posing risks to applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart medical implants, and IoT networks. This research develops a theoretical framework for NMAs, evaluates their impact using a simulated neuromorphic chip dataset, and proposes countermeasures, including neural-specific anomaly detection and secure synaptic learning protocols. The findings underscore the critical need for tailored cybersecurity measures to protect brain-inspired computing, offering a pioneering exploration of this emerging threat landscape.

<title>An approach to identify the most semantically informative deep representations of text and images</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can automate cybersecurity tasks and can adapt to the evolving cybersecurity landscape without re-engineering. While LLM agents have demonstrated cybersecurity capabilities on Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions, they have two key limitations: accessing latest cybersecurity expertise beyond training data, and integrating new knowledge into complex task planning. Knowledge-based approaches that incorporate technical understanding into the task-solving automation can tackle these limitations. We present CRAKEN, a knowledge-based LLM agent framework that improves cybersecurity capability through three core mechanisms: contextual decomposition of task-critical information, iterative self-reflected knowledge retrieval, and knowledge-hint injection that transforms insights into adaptive attack strategies. Comprehensive evaluations with different configurations show CRAKEN's effectiveness in multi-stage vulnerability detection and exploitation compared to previous approaches. Our extensible architecture establishes new methodologies for embedding new security knowledge into LLM-driven cybersecurity agentic systems. With a knowledge database of CTF writeups, CRAKEN obtained an accuracy of 22% on NYU CTF Bench, outperforming prior works by 3% and achieving state-of-the-art results. On evaluation of MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, CRAKEN solves 25-30% more techniques than prior work, demonstrating improved cybersecurity capabilities via knowledge-based execution. We make our framework open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/nyuctf_agents_craken.

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

Abstract: Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) for early mental health detection, such as depression, often optimized with machine-generated data. However, their detection may be subject to unknown weaknesses. Meanwhile, quality control has not been applied to these generated corpora besides limited human verifications. Our goal is to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning and reveal potential weaknesses. To this end, we first provide a systematic evaluation of the reasoning over machine-generated detection and interpretation. Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore mitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the following: A. Design an LLM instruction strategy that allows for systematic analysis of the detection by breaking down the task into several subtasks. B. Design contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical positive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C. Perform human annotation for the subtasks identified in the first step and evaluate the performance. D. Identify human-preferred detection with desired logical reasoning from the few-shot generation and use them to explore different optimization strategies. We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet dataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is describing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9 symptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of statistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing and detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit expressions of depression. Two optimization methods are used for performance enhancement and reduction of the statistic bias: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). Notably, the DPO approach achieves significant performance improvement.

<title>Conformal Language Model Reasoning with Coherent Factuality</title>

Abstract: Language models are increasingly being used in important decision pipelines, so ensuring the correctness of their outputs is crucial. Recent work has proposed evaluating the "factuality" of claims decomposed from a language model generation and applying conformal prediction techniques to filter out those claims that are not factual. This can be effective for tasks such as information retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation for factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a logical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of the claims that precede them. To capture this, we define "coherent factuality" and develop a conformal-prediction-based method to guarantee coherent factuality for language model outputs. Our approach applies split conformal prediction to subgraphs within a "deducibility" graph" that represents the steps of a reasoning problem. We evaluate our method on mathematical reasoning problems from the MATH and FELM datasets and find that our algorithm consistently produces correct and substantiated orderings of claims, achieving coherent factuality across target coverage levels. Moreover, we achieve 90% factuality on our stricter definition while retaining 80% or more of the original claims, highlighting the utility of our deducibility-graph-guided approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry). Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 92.5% of color and 74.6% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together, these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual behavior in multimodal models.

<title>Learning Probabilities of Causation from Finite Population Data</title>

Abstract: Probabilities of causation play a crucial role in modern decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of predicting probabilities of causation for subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data using machine learning models. Tian and Pearl first defined and derived tight bounds for three fundamental probabilities of causation: the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS), the probability of sufficiency (PS), and the probability of necessity (PN). However, estimating these probabilities requires both experimental and observational distributions specific to each subpopulation, which are often unavailable or impractical to obtain with limited population-level data. Therefore, for most subgroups, the amount of data they have is not enough to guarantee the accuracy of their probabilities. Hence, to estimate these probabilities for subpopulations with \textbf{insufficient} data, we propose using machine learning models that draw insights from subpopulations with sufficient data. Our evaluation of multiple machine learning models indicates that, given the population-level data and an appropriate choice of machine learning model and activation function, PNS can be effectively predicted. Through simulation studies on multiple Structured Causal Models (SCMs), we show that our multilayer perceptron (MLP) model with the Mish activation function achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately $0.02$ in predicting PNS for $32,768$ subpopulations across most SCMs using data from only $2,000$ subpopulations with known PNS values.

Abstract: As the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated over time, there is a growing need for efficient methods to update them, especially when injecting proprietary information. Our study reveals that comprehension-intensive fine-tuning tasks (e.g., question answering and blanks) achieve substantially higher knowledge retention rates (48%) compared to mapping-oriented tasks like translation (17%) or text-to-JSON conversion (20%), despite exposure to identical factual content. We demonstrate that this pattern persists across model architectures and follows scaling laws, with larger models showing improved retention across all task types. However, all models exhibit significant performance drops when applying injected knowledge in broader contexts, suggesting limited semantic integration. These findings show the importance of task selection in updating LLM knowledge, showing that effective knowledge injection relies not just on data exposure but on the depth of cognitive engagement during fine-tuning.

Abstract: The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by enabling more advanced analysis of customer personas. At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage. After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants found the updated system useful in business contexts.

Abstract: This work presents LURK (Latent UnleaRned Knowledge), a novel framework that probes for hidden retained knowledge in unlearned LLMs through adversarial suffix prompting. LURK automatically generates adversarial prompt suffixes designed to elicit residual knowledge about the Harry Potter domain, a commonly used benchmark for unlearning. Our experiments reveal that even models deemed successfully unlearned can leak idiosyncratic information under targeted adversarial conditions, highlighting critical limitations of current unlearning evaluation standards. By uncovering latent knowledge through indirect probing, LURK offers a more rigorous and diagnostic tool for assessing the robustness of unlearning algorithms. All code will be publicly available.

<title>Transfer Faster, Price Smarter: Minimax Dynamic Pricing under Cross-Market Preference Shift</title>

Abstract: We study contextual dynamic pricing when a target market can leverage K auxiliary markets -- offline logs or concurrent streams -- whose mean utilities differ by a structured preference shift. We propose Cross-Market Transfer Dynamic Pricing (CM-TDP), the first algorithm that provably handles such model-shift transfer and delivers minimax-optimal regret for both linear and non-parametric utility models.
  For linear utilities of dimension d, where the difference between source- and target-task coefficients is $s_{0}$-sparse, CM-TDP attains regret $\tilde{O}((d*K^{-1}+s_{0})\log T)$. For nonlinear demand residing in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with effective dimension $\alpha$, complexity $\beta$ and task-similarity parameter $H$, the regret becomes $\tilde{O}\!(K^{-2\alpha\beta/(2\alpha\beta+1)}T^{1/(2\alpha\beta+1)} + H^{2/(2\alpha+1)}T^{1/(2\alpha+1)})$, matching information-theoretic lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The RKHS bound is the first of its kind for transfer pricing and is of independent interest.
  Extensive simulations show up to 50% lower cumulative regret and 5 times faster learning relative to single-market pricing baselines. By bridging transfer learning, robust aggregation, and revenue optimization, CM-TDP moves toward pricing systems that transfer faster, price smarter.

Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein flow (SWF), a nonparametric and implicit generative gradient flow, is applied to fair regression. We have improved the SWF in a few aspects. First, the stochastic diffusive term from the Fokker-Planck equation-based Monte Carlo is transformed to Liouville partial differential equation (PDE)-based transport with density estimation, however, without the diffusive term. Now, the computation of the Wasserstein barycenter is approximated by the SWF barycenter with the prescription of Kantorovich potentials for the induced gradient flow to generate its samples. These two efforts improve the convergence in training and testing SWF and SWF barycenters with reduced variance. Applying the generative SWF barycenter for fair regression demonstrates competent profiles in the accuracy-fairness Pareto curves.

Abstract: Millions of people rely on search functionality to find and explore content on entertainment platforms. Modern search systems use a combination of candidate generation and ranking approaches, with advanced methods leveraging deep learning and LLM-based techniques to retrieve, generate, and categorize search results. Despite these advancements, search algorithms can still surface inappropriate or irrelevant content due to factors like model unpredictability, metadata errors, or overlooked design flaws. Such issues can misalign with product goals and user expectations, potentially harming user trust and business outcomes. In this work, we introduce an additional monitoring layer using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance content moderation. This additional layer flags content if the user did not intend to search for it. This approach serves as a baseline for product quality assurance, with collected feedback used to refine the initial retrieval mechanisms of the search model, ensuring a safer and more reliable user experience.

Abstract: The segmentation of kidney stones is regarded as a critical preliminary step to enable the identification of urinary stone types through machine- or deep-learning-based approaches. In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.

Abstract: Dataset pruning -- selecting a small yet informative subset of training data -- has emerged as a promising strategy for efficient machine learning, offering significant reductions in computational cost and storage compared to alternatives like dataset distillation. While pruning methods have shown strong performance in image classification, their extension to more complex computer vision tasks, particularly object detection, remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present the first principled extension of classification pruning techniques to the object detection domain, to the best of our knowledge. We identify and address three key challenges that hinder this transition: the Object-Level Attribution Problem, the Scoring Strategy Problem, and the Image-Level Aggregation Problem. To overcome these, we propose tailored solutions, including a novel scoring method called Variance-based Prediction Score (VPS). VPS leverages both Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence scores to effectively identify informative training samples specific to detection tasks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms prior dataset pruning methods in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). We also show that annotation count and class distribution shift can influence detection performance, but selecting informative examples is a more critical factor than dataset size or balance. Our work bridges dataset pruning and object detection, paving the way for dataset pruning in complex vision tasks.

Abstract: Big trajectory data hold great promise for human mobility analysis, but their utility is often constrained by the absence of critical traveler attributes, particularly sociodemographic information. While prior studies have explored predicting such attributes from mobility patterns, they often overlooked underlying cognitive mechanisms and exhibited low predictive accuracy. This study introduces SILIC, short for Sociodemographic Inference with LLM-guided Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Cognitive Chain Reasoning (CCR), a theoretically grounded framework that leverages LLMs to infer sociodemographic attributes from observed mobility patterns by capturing latent behavioral intentions and reasoning through psychological constructs. Particularly, our approach explicitly follows the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a foundational behavioral framework in transportation research, to model individuals' latent cognitive processes underlying travel decision-making. The LLMs further provide heuristic guidance to improve IRL reward function initialization and update by addressing its ill-posedness and optimization challenges arising from the vast and unstructured reward space. Evaluated in the 2017 Puget Sound Regional Council Household Travel Survey, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows great promise for enriching big trajectory data to support more behaviorally grounded applications in transportation planning and beyond.

Abstract: Large language models excel at complex tasks by breaking down problems into structured reasoning steps. However, reasoning traces often extend beyond reaching a correct answer, causing wasted computation, reduced readability, and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a novel hyperparameter-free conciseness score used as a reward signal within a reinforcement learning framework to guide models toward generating correct and concise reasoning traces. This score is evaluated by a large language model acting as a judge, enabling dynamic, context-aware feedback beyond simple token length. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on the MATH dataset, reducing token usage by up to 31x on simple problems while improving accuracy by 7%, and on the hardest problems, it outperforms full reasoning by +7.5% accuracy with up to 3.6x fewer tokens. On TheoremQA, our method improves accuracy by +2.2% using 12.5x fewer tokens. We also conduct ablation studies on the judge model, reward composition, and problem difficulty, showing that our method dynamically adapts reasoning length based on problem difficulty and benefits significantly from stronger judges. The code, model weights, and datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/RazvanDu/ConciseRL.

Abstract: Randomized clinical trials often require large patient cohorts before drawing definitive conclusions, yet abundant observational data from parallel studies remains underutilized due to confounding and hidden biases. To bridge this gap, we propose Deconfounded Warm-Start Thompson Sampling (DWTS), a practical approach that leverages a Doubly Debiased LASSO (DDL) procedure to identify a sparse set of reliable measured covariates and combines them with key hidden covariates to form a reduced context. By initializing Thompson Sampling (LinTS) priors with DDL-estimated means and variances on these measured features -- while keeping uninformative priors on hidden features -- DWTS effectively harnesses confounded observational data to kick-start adaptive clinical trials. Evaluated on both a purely synthetic environment and a virtual environment created using real cardiovascular risk dataset, DWTS consistently achieves lower cumulative regret than standard LinTS, showing how offline causal insights from observational data can improve trial efficiency and support more personalized treatment decisions.

<title>Learning to Choose or Choosing to Learn: Best-of-N vs. Supervised Fine-Tuning for Bit String Generation</title>

Abstract: Using the bit string generation problem as a case study, we theoretically compare two standard methods for adapting large language models to new tasks. The first, referred to as supervised fine-tuning, involves training a new next token predictor on good generations. The second method, Best-of-N, trains a reward model to select good responses from a collection generated by an unaltered base model. If the learning setting is realizable, we find that supervised fine-tuning outperforms BoN through a better dependence on the response length in its rate of convergence. If realizability fails, then depending on the failure mode, BoN can enjoy a better rate of convergence in either n or a rate of convergence with better dependence on the response length.

Abstract: We consider the problem of solving the optimal transport problem between two empirical distributions with missing values. Our main assumption is that the data is missing completely at random (MCAR), but we allow for heterogeneous missingness probabilities across features and across the two distributions. As a first contribution, we show that the Wasserstein distance between empirical Gaussian distributions and linear Monge maps between arbitrary distributions can be debiased without significantly affecting the sample complexity. Secondly, we show that entropic regularized optimal transport can be estimated efficiently and consistently using iterative singular value thresholding (ISVT). We propose a validation set-free hyperparameter selection strategy for ISVT that leverages our estimator of the Bures-Wasserstein distance, which could be of independent interest in general matrix completion problems. Finally, we validate our findings on a wide range of numerical applications.

Abstract: Large language models suffer issues when operated on long contexts that are larger than their training context length due to the standard position encoding for tokens in the attention layer. Tokens a long distance apart will rarely have an effect on each other and long prompts yield unexpected results. To solve this problem, we propose SELF (Self-Extend the Context Length With Logistic Growth Function): a solution of grouping consecutive tokens at varying group sizes using a logistic capacity equation combined with a constant group size at smaller relative distances. Our model had an increase in performance of up to 12% compared to the LongLM extension method in LEval (specifically on the Qwen model). On summarization related tasks in LongBench, our model performed up to 6.4% better than LongLM (specifically on the Llama-2-7b model). On reading comprehension tasks from LEval, our model performed up to 5.4% better than the LongLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexeipc/SELF-LLM.

Abstract: Construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for functionals based on asymptotically normal estimators is a classical topic in statistical inference. The simplest and in many cases optimal inference procedure is the Wald interval or the likelihood ratio test, both of which require an estimator and an estimate of the asymptotic variance of the estimator. Estimators obtained from online/sequential algorithms forces one to consider the computational aspects of the inference problem, i.e., one cannot access all of the data as many times as needed. Several works on this topic explored the online estimation of asymptotic variance. In this article, we propose computationally efficient, rate-optimal, and asymptotically valid confidence regions based on the output of online algorithms {\em without} estimating the asymptotic variance. As a special case, this implies inference from any algorithm that yields an asymptotically normal estimator. We focus our efforts on stochastic gradient descent with Polyak averaging to understand the practical performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proven an effective tool for solving differential equations, in particular when considering non-standard or ill-posed settings. When inferring solutions and parameters of the differential equation from data, uncertainty estimates are preferable to point estimates, as they give an idea about the accuracy of the solution. In this work, we consider the inverse problem and employ repulsive ensembles of PINNs (RE-PINN) for obtaining such estimates. The repulsion is implemented by adding a particular repulsive term to the loss function, which has the property that the ensemble predictions correspond to the true Bayesian posterior in the limit of infinite ensemble members. Where possible, we compare the ensemble predictions to Monte Carlo baselines. Whereas the standard ensemble tends to collapse to maximum-a-posteriori solutions, the repulsive ensemble produces significantly more accurate uncertainty estimates and exhibits higher sample diversity.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in medical imaging is crucial for identifying pathological abnormalities without requiring extensive labeled data. However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process, improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features. Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging.

Abstract: LLMs often need effective configurations, like temperature and reasoning steps, to handle tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving, ranging from joke generation to mathematical reasoning. Existing prompting approaches usually adopt general-purpose, fixed configurations that work 'well enough' across tasks but seldom achieve task-specific optimality. To address this gap, we introduce AdaReasoner, an LLM-agnostic plugin designed for any LLM to automate adaptive reasoning configurations for tasks requiring different types of thinking. AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration strategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for reasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by theoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear policy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it consistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution robustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored prompts.

<title>Longer Context, Deeper Thinking: Uncovering the Role of Long-Context Ability in Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2505.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent language models exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, yet the influence of long-context capacity on reasoning remains underexplored. In this work, we hypothesize that current limitations in reasoning stem, in part, from insufficient long-context capacity, motivated by empirical observations such as (1) higher context window length often leads to stronger reasoning performance, and (2) failed reasoning cases resemble failed long-context cases. To test this hypothesis, we examine whether enhancing a model's long-context ability before Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) leads to improved reasoning performance. Specifically, we compared models with identical architectures and fine-tuning data but varying levels of long-context capacity. Our results reveal a consistent trend: models with stronger long-context capacity achieve significantly higher accuracy on reasoning benchmarks after SFT. Notably, these gains persist even on tasks with short input lengths, indicating that long-context training offers generalizable benefits for reasoning performance. These findings suggest that long-context modeling is not just essential for processing lengthy inputs, but also serves as a critical foundation for reasoning. We advocate for treating long-context capacity as a first-class objective in the design of future language models.

Abstract: Achieving better alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the abilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly for recent models that rely on powerful pretrained vision encoders and LLMs. A common approach to connect the pretrained vision encoder and LLM is through a projector applied after the vision encoder. However, the projector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence the mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In this work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision embeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector significantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while preserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual content. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each vision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a *multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the projector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a limited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue, we propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level alignment. Our experiments show that patch-aligned training (1) achieves stronger compression capability and improved patch-level alignment, enabling the MLLM to generate higher-quality captions, (2) improves the MLLM's performance by 16% on referring expression grounding tasks, 4% on question-answering tasks, and 3% on modern instruction-following benchmarks when using the same supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. The proposed method can be easily extended to other multimodal models.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences. While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expansion*: early layers progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers expand these representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: Humans are remarkably adept at collaboration, able to infer the strengths and weaknesses of new partners in order to work successfully towards shared goals. To build AI systems with this capability, we must first understand its building blocks: does such flexibility require explicit, dedicated mechanisms for modelling others -- or can it emerge spontaneously from the pressures of open-ended cooperative interaction? To investigate this question, we train simple model-free RNN agents to collaborate with a population of diverse partners. Using the `Overcooked-AI' environment, we collect data from thousands of collaborative teams, and analyse agents' internal hidden states. Despite a lack of additional architectural features, inductive biases, or auxiliary objectives, the agents nevertheless develop structured internal representations of their partners' task abilities, enabling rapid adaptation and generalisation to novel collaborators. We investigated these internal models through probing techniques, and large-scale behavioural analysis. Notably, we find that structured partner modelling emerges when agents can influence partner behaviour by controlling task allocation. Our results show that partner modelling can arise spontaneously in model-free agents -- but only under environmental conditions that impose the right kind of social pressure.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in late 2022 has impacted academic writing, threatening credibility, and causing institutional uncertainty. We seek to determine the degree to which LLMs are used to generate critical text as opposed to being used for editing, such as checking for grammar errors or inappropriate phrasing. In our study, we analyze arXiv papers for stylistic segmentation, which we measure by varying a PELT threshold against a Bayesian classifier trained on GPT-regenerated text. We find that LLM-attributed language is not predictive of stylistic segmentation, suggesting that when authors use LLMs, they do so uniformly, reducing the risk of hallucinations being introduced into academic preprints.

Abstract: A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring tuning a large number of parameters, the linear encoding approach ignores the structure of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed alternatives have focused on decomposing the linear mapping to spatial and feature components but focus on finding static receptive fields for units that are applicable only in early visual areas. In this work, we employ the attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more interpretable, without the need to create importance maps, by interpreting the attention routing signal for different high-level categorical areas. Our approach proposes a mechanistic model of how visual information from retinotopic maps can be routed based on the relevance of the input content to different category-selective regions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph (FS-DAG), a scalable and efficient model architecture for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) in few-shot settings. FS-DAG leverages domain-specific and language/vision specific backbones within a modular framework to adapt to diverse document types with minimal data. The model is robust to practical challenges such as handling OCR errors, misspellings, and domain shifts, which are critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less than 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications for Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are limited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for information extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this work highlights the ongoing progress in developing smaller, more efficient models that do not compromise on performance. Code : https://github.com/oracle-samples/fs-dag

Abstract: Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) for critical communication tasks, such as drafting emails, crafting sales pitches, and composing casual messages. Deploying such models across different regions requires them to understand diverse cultural and linguistic contexts and generate safe and respectful responses. For enterprise applications, it is crucial to mitigate reputational risks, maintain trust, and ensure compliance by effectively identifying and handling unsafe or offensive language. To address this, we introduce SweEval, a benchmark simulating real-world scenarios with variations in tone (positive or negative) and context (formal or informal). The prompts explicitly instruct the model to include specific swear words while completing the task. This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs comply with or resist such inappropriate instructions and assesses their alignment with ethical frameworks, cultural nuances, and language comprehension capabilities. In order to advance research in building ethically aligned AI systems for enterprise use and beyond, we release the dataset and code: https://github.com/amitbcp/multilingual_profanity.

Abstract: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster, and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than the state of the art.

Abstract: The explosive growth of global data traffic demands scalable and energy-efficient optical communication systems. Spatial division multiplexing (SDM) using multicore or multimode fibers is a promising solution to overcome the capacity limit of single-mode fibers. However, long-haul SDM transmission faces significant challenges due to modal dispersion, which imposes heavy computational loads on digital signal processing (DSP) for signal equalization. Here, we propose parameterized SDM transmission, where programmable photonic unitary processors are installed at intermediate nodes. Instead of relying on conventional digital equalization only on the receiver side, our approach enables direct optimization of the SDM transmission channel itself by the programmable unitary processor, which reduces digital post-processing loads. We introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using a differentiable SDM transmission model to determine the optimal unitary transformation. As a key enabler, we first implemented telecom-grade programmable photonic unitary processor, achieving a low-loss (2.1 dB fiber-to-fiber), wideband (full C-band), polarization-independent, and high-fidelity (R2>96% across the C-band) operation. We experimentally demonstrate 1300-km transmission using a three-mode fiber, achieving strong agreement between simulation and experiment. The optimized photonic processor significantly reduces modal dispersion and post-processing complexity. Our results establish a scalable framework for integrating photonic computation into the optical layer, enabling more efficient, high-capacity optical networks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, their substantial inference cost poses a major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DASH}, an adaptive layer-skipping framework that dynamically selects computation paths conditioned on input characteristics. We model the skipping process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling fine-grained token-level decisions based on intermediate representations. To mitigate potential performance degradation caused by skipping, we introduce a lightweight compensation mechanism that injects differential rewards into the decision process. Furthermore, we design an asynchronous execution strategy that overlaps layer computation with policy evaluation to minimize runtime overhead. Experiments on multiple LLM architectures and NLP benchmarks show that our method achieves significant inference acceleration while maintaining competitive task performance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.

Motivated by recent applications, we introduce two broad formulations: Unrestricted Sparsest Submodular Set (USSS) and Unrestricted Densest Supermodular Set (UDSS), which allow for negative and non-monotone functions.
  We show that DSS, SFM, USSS, UDSS, and the Minimum Norm Point (MNP) problem are equivalent under strongly polynomial-time reductions, enabling algorithmic crossover. In particular, viewing these through the lens of the MNP in the base polyhedron, we connect Fujishige's theory with dense decomposition, and show that both Fujishige-Wolfe's algorithm and the heuristic \textsc{SuperGreedy++} act as universal solvers for all these problems, including sub-modular function minimization.
  Theoretically, we explain why \textsc{SuperGreedy++} is effective beyond DSS, including for tasks like submodular minimization and minimum $ s $-$ t $ cut. Empirically, we test several solvers, including the Fujishige-Wolfe algorithm on over 400 experiments across seven problem types and large-scale real/synthetic datasets. Surprisingly, general-purpose convex and flow-based methods outperform task-specific baselines, demonstrating that with the right framing, general optimization techniques can be both scalable and state-of-the-art for submodular and supermodular ratio problems.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) in adaptive experiments where treatment can only be encouraged--rather than directly assigned--via a binary instrumental variable. Building on semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive the efficiency bound for ATE estimation under arbitrary, history-dependent instrument-assignment policies, and show it is minimized by a variance-aware allocation rule that balances outcome noise and compliance variability. Leveraging this insight, we introduce AMRIV--an \textbf{A}daptive, \textbf{M}ultiply-\textbf{R}obust estimator for \textbf{I}nstrumental-\textbf{V}ariable settings with variance-optimal assignment. AMRIV pairs (i) an online policy that adaptively approximates the optimal allocation with (ii) a sequential, influence-function-based estimator that attains the semiparametric efficiency bound while retaining multiply-robust consistency. We establish asymptotic normality, explicit convergence rates, and anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequences that enable sequential inference. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through empirical studies, showing that adaptive instrument assignment, when combined with the AMRIV estimator, yields improved efficiency and robustness compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Project duplication detection is critical for project quality assessment, as it improves resource utilization efficiency by preventing investing in newly proposed project that have already been studied. It requires the ability to understand high-level semantics and generate constructive and valuable feedback. Existing detection methods rely on basic word- or sentence-level comparison or solely apply large language models, lacking valuable insights for experts and in-depth comprehension of project content and review criteria. To tackle this issue, we propose PD$^3$, a Project Duplication Detection framework via adapted multi-agent Debate. Inspired by real-world expert debates, it employs a fair competition format to guide multi-agent debate to retrieve relevant projects. For feedback, it incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis to improve its practicality. Over 800 real-world power project data spanning more than 20 specialized fields are used to evaluate the framework, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches by 7.43% and 8.00% in two downstream tasks. Furthermore, we establish an online platform, Review Dingdang, to assist power experts, saving 5.73 million USD in initial detection on more than 100 newly proposed projects.

<title>Analyzing Mitigation Strategies for Catastrophic Forgetting in End-to-End Training of Spoken Language Models</title>

Abstract: End-to-end training of Spoken Language Models (SLMs) commonly involves adapting pre-trained text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the speech modality through multi-stage training on diverse tasks such as ASR, TTS and spoken question answering (SQA). Although this multi-stage continual learning equips LLMs with both speech understanding and generation capabilities, the substantial differences in task and data distributions across stages can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost. This paper investigates catastrophic forgetting and evaluates three mitigation strategies-model merging, discounting the LoRA scaling factor, and experience replay to balance knowledge retention with new learning. Results show that experience replay is the most effective, with further gains achieved by combining it with other methods. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and efficient SLM training pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition analyzes emotions by combining data from multiple sources. However, real-world noise or sensor failures often cause missing or corrupted data, creating the Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition (IMER) challenge. In this paper, we propose Robust Hybrid Diffusion Recovery (RoHyDR), a novel framework that performs missing-modality recovery at unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. For unimodal representation recovery of missing modalities, RoHyDR exploits a diffusion-based generator to generate distribution-consistent and semantically aligned representations from Gaussian noise, using available modalities as conditioning. For multimodal fusion recovery, we introduce adversarial learning to produce a realistic fused multimodal representation and recover missing semantic content. We further propose a multi-stage optimization strategy that enhances training stability and efficiency. In contrast to previous work, the hybrid diffusion and adversarial learning-based recovery mechanism in RoHyDR allows recovery of missing information in both unimodal representation and multimodal fusion, at both feature and semantic levels, effectively mitigating performance degradation caused by suboptimal optimization. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely used multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IMER methods, achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: We study offline constrained reinforcement learning (RL) with general function approximation. We aim to learn a policy from a pre-collected dataset that maximizes the expected discounted cumulative reward for a primary reward signal while ensuring that expected discounted returns for multiple auxiliary reward signals are above predefined thresholds. Existing algorithms either require fully exploratory data, are computationally inefficient, or depend on an additional auxiliary function classes to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with sample complexity $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. In this paper, we propose an oracle-efficient primal-dual algorithm based on a linear programming (LP) formulation, achieving $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity under partial data coverage. By introducing a realizability assumption, our approach ensures that all saddle points of the Lagrangian are optimal, removing the need for regularization that complicated prior analyses. Through Lagrangian decomposition, our method extracts policies without requiring knowledge of the data-generating distribution, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making systems sometimes produce errors or skewed predictions toward a particular group, leading to unfair results. Debiasing practices, applied at different stages of the development of such systems, occasionally introduce new forms of unfairness or exacerbate existing inequalities. We focus on post-processing techniques that modify algorithmic predictions to achieve fairness in classification tasks, examining the unintended consequences of these interventions. To address this challenge, we develop a set of measures that quantify the disparity in the flips applied to the solution in the post-processing stage. The proposed measures will help practitioners: (1) assess the proportionality of the debiasing strategy used, (2) have transparency to explain the effects of the strategy in each group, and (3) based on those results, analyze the possibility of the use of some other approaches for bias mitigation or to solve the problem. We introduce a methodology for applying the proposed metrics during the post-processing stage and illustrate its practical application through an example. This example demonstrates how analyzing the proportionality of the debiasing strategy complements traditional fairness metrics, providing a deeper perspective to ensure fairer outcomes across all groups.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables high data rates for cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, a robust beam management remains challenging due to significant path loss and the dynamic mobility of UAVs, which can destabilize the UAV-base station (BS) link. This research presents a GPS-aided deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously predicts current and future optimal beams for UAV mmWave communications, maintaining a Top-1 prediction accuracy exceeding 70% and an average power loss below 0.6 dB across all prediction steps. These outcomes stem from a proposed data set splitting method ensuring balanced label distribution, paired with a GPS preprocessing technique that extracts key positional features, and a DL architecture that maps sequential position data to beam index predictions. The model reduces overhead by approximately 93% (requiring the training of 2 ~ 3 beams instead of 32 beams) with 95% beam prediction accuracy guarantees, and ensures 94% to 96% of predictions exhibit mean power loss not exceeding 1 dB.

Abstract: General-purpose large language models, despite their broad capabilities, often struggle with specialized domain knowledge, a limitation particularly pronounced in more accessible, lower-parameter versions. This gap hinders their deployment as effective agents in demanding fields such as astronomy. Building on our prior work with AstroSage-8B, this study introduces AstroSage-70B, a significantly larger and more advanced domain-specialized natural-language AI assistant. It is designed for research and education across astronomy, astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical instrumentation. Developed from the Llama-3.1-70B foundation, AstroSage-70B underwent extensive continued pre-training on a vast corpus of astronomical literature, followed by supervised fine-tuning and model merging. Beyond its 70-billion parameter scale, this model incorporates refined datasets, judiciously chosen learning hyperparameters, and improved training procedures, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex astronomical tasks. Notably, we integrated reasoning chains into the SFT dataset, enabling AstroSage-70B to either answer the user query immediately, or first emit a human-readable thought process. Evaluated on the AstroMLab-1 benchmark -- comprising 4,425 questions from literature withheld during training -- AstroSage-70B achieves state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses all other tested open-weight and proprietary models, including leading systems like o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen-3-235B, even those with API costs two orders of magnitude higher. This work demonstrates that domain specialization, when applied to large-scale models, can enable them to outperform generalist counterparts in specialized knowledge areas like astronomy, thereby advancing the frontier of AI capabilities in the field.

Abstract: As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem, leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Verifiable computing (VC) has gained prominence in decentralized machine learning systems, where resource-intensive tasks like deep neural network (DNN) inference are offloaded to external participants due to blockchain limitations. This creates a need to verify the correctness of outsourced computations without re-execution. We propose \texttt{Range-Arithmetic}, a novel framework for efficient and verifiable DNN inference that transforms non-arithmetic operations, such as rounding after fixed-point matrix multiplication and ReLU, into arithmetic steps verifiable using sum-check protocols and concatenated range proofs. Our approach avoids the complexity of Boolean encoding, high-degree polynomials, and large lookup tables while remaining compatible with finite-field-based proof systems. Experimental results show that our method not only matches the performance of existing approaches, but also reduces the computational cost of verifying the results, the computational effort required from the untrusted party performing the DNN inference, and the communication overhead between the two sides.

Abstract: Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others, masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM), a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B, Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their safety.

Abstract: Requirements elicitation and specification remains a labor-intensive, manual process prone to inconsistencies and gaps, presenting a significant challenge in modern software engineering. Emerging studies underscore the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for automated requirements generation to support requirements elicitation and specification; however, it remains unclear how to implement this effectively. In this work, we introduce ReqBrain, an Al-assisted tool that employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate authentic and adequate software requirements. Software engineers can engage with ReqBrain through chat-based sessions to automatically generate software requirements and categorize them by type. We curated a high-quality dataset of ISO 29148-compliant requirements and fine-tuned five 7B-parameter LLMs to determine the most effective base model for ReqBrain. The top-performing model, Zephyr-7b-beta, achieved 89.30\% Fl using the BERT score and a FRUGAL score of 91.20 in generating authentic and adequate requirements. Human evaluations further confirmed ReqBrain's effectiveness in generating requirements. Our findings suggest that generative Al, when fine-tuned, has the potential to improve requirements elicitation and specification, paving the way for future extensions into areas such as defect identification, test case generation, and agile user story creation.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning models, particularly tree-based approaches, have demonstrated promising performance across various clinical prediction tasks using electronic health record (EHR) data. Despite their strengths, these models struggle with tasks that require deeper contextual understanding, such as predicting 30-day hospital readmission. This can be primarily due to the limited semantic information available in structured EHR data. To address this limitation, we propose a deep multimodal contrastive learning (CL) framework that aligns the latent representations of structured EHR data with unstructured discharge summary notes. It works by pulling together paired EHR and text embeddings while pushing apart unpaired ones. Fine-tuning the pretrained EHR encoder extracted from this framework significantly boosts downstream task performance, e.g., a 4.1% AUROC enhancement over XGBoost for 30-day readmission prediction. Such results demonstrate the effect of integrating domain knowledge from clinical notes into EHR-based pipelines, enabling more accurate and context-aware clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning performance, eliciting the long chain-of-thought (CoT) ability in large language models (LLMs) typically requires costly reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on high-quality distilled data. We investigate the internal mechanisms behind this capability and show that a small set of high-impact activations in the last few layers largely governs long-form reasoning attributes, such as output length and self-reflection. By simply amplifying these activations and inserting "wait" tokens, we can invoke the long CoT ability without any training, resulting in significantly increased self-reflection rates and accuracy. Moreover, we find that the activation dynamics follow predictable trajectories, with a sharp rise after special tokens and a subsequent exponential decay. Building on these insights, we introduce a general training-free activation control technique. It leverages a few contrastive examples to identify key activations, and employs simple analytic functions to modulate their values at inference time to elicit long CoTs. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in efficiently eliciting long CoT reasoning in LLMs and improving their performance. Additionally, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that trains only a last-layer activation amplification module and a few LoRA layers, outperforming full LoRA fine-tuning on reasoning benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters. Our code and data are publicly released.

Abstract: Automatic program repair seeks to generate correct code from buggy programs, with most approaches searching the correct program in a discrete, symbolic space of source code tokens. This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space. Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of 1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research, bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning state over time and predict their future performance. However, traditional KT methods often face challenges in explainability, scalability, and effective modeling of complex knowledge dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) present new avenues for KT, their direct application often struggles with generating structured, explainable student representations and lacks mechanisms for continuous, task-specific refinement. To address these gaps, we propose Collaborative Iterative Knowledge Tracing (CIKT), a framework that harnesses LLMs to enhance both prediction accuracy and explainability. CIKT employs a dual-component architecture: an Analyst generates dynamic, explainable user profiles from student historical responses, and a Predictor utilizes these profiles to forecast future performance. The core of CIKT is a synergistic optimization loop. In this loop, the Analyst is iteratively refined based on the predictive accuracy of the Predictor, which conditions on the generated profiles, and the Predictor is subsequently retrained using these enhanced profiles. Evaluated on multiple educational datasets, CIKT demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy, offers enhanced explainability through its dynamically updated user profiles, and exhibits improved scalability. Our work presents a robust and explainable solution for advancing knowledge tracing systems, effectively bridging the gap between predictive performance and model transparency.

Abstract: Causal inference requires evaluating models on balanced distributions between treatment and control groups, while training data often exhibits imbalance due to historical decision-making policies. Most conventional statistical methods address this distribution shift through inverse probability weighting (IPW), which requires estimating propensity scores as an intermediate step. These methods face two key challenges: inaccurate propensity estimation and instability from extreme weights. We decompose the generalization error to isolate these issues--propensity ambiguity and statistical instability--and address them through an adversarial loss function. Our approach combines distributionally robust optimization for handling propensity uncertainty with weight regularization based on weighted Rademacher complexity. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.

<title>RQR3D: Reparametrizing the regression targets for BEV-based 3D object detection</title>

Abstract: Accurate, fast, and reliable 3D perception is essential for autonomous driving. Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision, and real-world readiness of our approach.

Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare, yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: This article studies the problem of online non-parametric change point detection in multivariate data streams. We approach the problem through the lens of kernel-based two-sample testing and introduce a sequential testing procedure based on random Fourier features, running with logarithmic time complexity per observation and with overall logarithmic space complexity. The algorithm has two advantages compared to the state of the art. First, our approach is genuinely online, and no access to training data known to be from the pre-change distribution is necessary. Second, the algorithm does not require the user to specify a window parameter over which local tests are to be calculated. We prove strong theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's performance, including information-theoretic bounds demonstrating that the detection delay is optimal in the minimax sense. Numerical studies on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm is competitive with respect to the state of the art.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique which is able to partition unlabelled data into disjoint clusters of distinct shapes. However, the data under consideration are often experimental data, implying that the data is subject to measurement errors and measurements may even be lost or invalid. These uncertainties in the corrupted input data induce corresponding uncertainties in the resulting clusters, and the clusterings thus become unreliable.
  Modelling the uncertainties as random processes, we discuss a mathematical framework based on random set theory for the computational Monte Carlo approximation of statistically expected clusterings in case of corrupted, i.e., perturbed, incomplete, and possibly even additional, data. We propose several computationally accessible quantities of interest and analyze their consistency in the infinite data point and infinite Monte Carlo sample limit. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate and compare the proposed quantities.

Abstract: Musical (MSS) source separation of western popular music using non-causal deep learning can be very effective. In contrast, MSS for classical music is an unsolved problem. Classical ensembles are harder to separate than popular music because of issues such as the inherent greater variation in the music; the sparsity of recordings with ground truth for supervised training; and greater ambiguity between instruments. The Cadenza project has been exploring MSS for classical music. This is being done so music can be remixed to improve listening experiences for people with hearing loss. To enable the work, a new database of synthesized woodwind ensembles was created to overcome instrumental imbalances in the EnsembleSet. For the MSS, a set of ConvTasNet models was used with each model being trained to extract a string or woodwind instrument. ConvTasNet was chosen because it enabled both causal and non-causal approaches to be tested. Non-causal approaches have dominated MSS work and are useful for recorded music, but for live music or processing on hearing aids, causal signal processing is needed. The MSS performance was evaluated on the two small datasets (Bach10 and URMP) of real instrument recordings where the ground-truth is available. The performances of the causal and non-causal systems were similar. Comparing the average Signal-to-Distortion (SDR) of the synthesized validation set (6.2 dB causal; 6.9 non-causal), to the real recorded evaluation set (0.3 dB causal, 0.4 dB non-causal), shows that mismatch between synthesized and recorded data is a problem. Future work needs to either gather more real recordings that can be used for training, or to improve the realism and diversity of the synthesized recordings to reduce the mismatch...

<title>Investigating Affect Mining Techniques for Annotation Sample Selection in the Creation of Finnish Affective Speech Corpus</title>

Abstract: Study of affect in speech requires suitable data, as emotional expression and perception vary across languages. Until now, no corpus has existed for natural expression of affect in spontaneous Finnish, existing data being acted or from a very specific communicative setting. This paper presents the first such corpus, created by annotating 12,000 utterances for emotional arousal and valence, sampled from three large-scale Finnish speech corpora. To ensure diverse affective expression, sample selection was conducted with an affect mining approach combining acoustic, cross-linguistic speech emotion, and text sentiment features. We compare this method to random sampling in terms of annotation diversity, and conduct post-hoc analyses to identify sampling choices that would have maximized the diversity. As an outcome, the work introduces a spontaneous Finnish affective speech corpus and informs sampling strategies for affective speech corpus creation in other languages or domains.

Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning method for decoding error correction codes based on the Mamba architecture, enhanced with Transformer layers. Our approach proposes a hybrid decoder that leverages Mamba's efficient sequential modeling while maintaining the global context capabilities of Transformers. To further improve performance, we design a novel layer-wise masking strategy applied to each Mamba layer, allowing selective attention to relevant code features at different depths. Additionally, we introduce a progressive layer-wise loss, supervising the network at intermediate stages and promoting robust feature extraction throughout the decoding process. Comprehensive experiments across a range of linear codes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Transformer-only decoders and standard Mamba models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized, relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank estimation and an $\mathcal{O}(\log(t)/t)$ rate for trimmed mean estimation, where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data distributions and contamination schemes.

<title>Continuum Transformers Perform In-Context Learning by Operator Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: Transformers robustly exhibit the ability to perform in-context learning, whereby their predictive accuracy on a task can increase not by parameter updates but merely with the placement of training samples in their context windows. Recent works have shown that transformers achieve this by implementing gradient descent in their forward passes. Such results, however, are restricted to standard transformer architectures, which handle finite-dimensional inputs. In the space of PDE surrogate modeling, a generalization of transformers to handle infinite-dimensional function inputs, known as "continuum transformers," has been proposed and similarly observed to exhibit in-context learning. Despite impressive empirical performance, such in-context learning has yet to be theoretically characterized. We herein demonstrate that continuum transformers perform in-context operator learning by performing gradient descent in an operator RKHS. We demonstrate this using novel proof strategies that leverage a generalized representer theorem for Hilbert spaces and gradient flows over the space of functionals of a Hilbert space. We additionally show the operator learned in context is the Bayes Optimal Predictor in the infinite depth limit of the transformer. We then provide empirical validations of this optimality result and demonstrate that the parameters under which such gradient descent is performed are recovered through the continuum transformer training.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motion with high-level controls is a crucial task for social understanding, robotics, and animation. With high-quality MOCAP data becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of two-person and multi-person interactions.

Abstract: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms aim to suppress unwanted acoustic disturbances by generating anti-noise signals that destructively interfere with the original noise in real time. Although recent deep learning-based ANC algorithms have set new performance benchmarks, there remains a shortage of theoretical limits to rigorously assess their improvements. To address this, we derive a unified lower bound on cancellation performance composed of two components. The first component is information-theoretic: it links residual error power to the fraction of disturbance entropy captured by the anti-noise signal, thereby quantifying limits imposed by information-processing capacity. The second component is support-based: it measures the irreducible error arising in frequency bands that the cancellation path cannot address, reflecting fundamental physical constraints. By taking the maximum of these two terms, our bound establishes a theoretical ceiling on the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) attainable by any ANC algorithm. We validate its tightness empirically on the NOISEX dataset under varying reverberation times, demonstrating robustness across diverse acoustic conditions.

<title>Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Fused Unified Nonconvex Tensor Ring Factors Regularization</title>

Abstract: In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR) factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection accuracy.

Abstract: The quality of foundation models depends heavily on their training data. Consequently, great efforts have been put into dataset curation. Yet most approaches rely on manual tuning of coarse-grained mixtures of large buckets of data, or filtering by hand-crafted heuristics. An approach that is ultimately more scalable (let alone more satisfying) is to \emph{learn} which data is actually valuable for training. This type of meta-learning could allow more sophisticated, fine-grained, and effective curation. Our proposed \emph{DataRater} is an instance of this idea. It estimates the value of training on any particular data point. This is done by meta-learning using `meta-gradients', with the objective of improving training efficiency on held out data. In extensive experiments across a range of model scales and datasets, we find that using our DataRater to filter data is highly effective, resulting in significantly improved compute efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate the function space dynamics of a two-layer ReLU neural network in the infinite-width limit, highlighting the Fisher information matrix (FIM)'s role in steering learning. Extending seminal works on approximate eigendecomposition of the FIM, we derive the asymptotic behavior of basis functions ($f_v(x) = X^{\top} v $) for four groups of approximate eigenvectors, showing their convergence to distinct function forms. These functions, prioritized by gradient descent, exhibit FIM-induced inner products that approximate orthogonality in the function space, forging a novel connection between parameter and function spaces. Simulations validate the accuracy of these theoretical approximations, confirming their practical relevance. By refining the function space inner product's role, we advance the theoretical framework for ReLU networks, illuminating their optimization and expressivity. Overall, this work offers a robust foundation for understanding wide neural networks and enhances insights into scalable deep learning architectures, paving the way for improved design and analysis of neural networks.

Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a long-standing challenge due to their large combinatorial space and the complex 3D arrangements of building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known ground-truth local block-wise 3D coordinates. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage de novo MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train a SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate novel metal and organic building blocks, paired with cheminformatics for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow-matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble flexible blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability of our model to create novel building blocks.

Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.

Abstract: Determining the type of kidney stones is crucial for prescribing appropriate treatments to prevent recurrence. Currently, various approaches exist to identify the type of kidney stones. However, obtaining results through the reference ex vivo identification procedure can take several weeks, while in vivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. For this reason, deep learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an automated classification of kidney stones during ureteroscopies. Nevertheless, a common issue with these models is the lack of training data. This contribution presents a deep learning method based on few-shot learning, aimed at producing sufficiently discriminative features for identifying kidney stone types in endoscopic images, even with a very limited number of samples. This approach was specifically designed for scenarios where endoscopic images are scarce or where uncommon classes are present, enabling classification even with a limited training dataset. The results demonstrate that Prototypical Networks, using up to 25% of the training data, can achieve performance equal to or better than traditional deep learning models trained with the complete dataset.

Abstract: The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review comments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as snippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics like BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users, analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context, 2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and 4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a 10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g., AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling tasks have been driven by architectures such as Transformers and, more recently, by Selective State Space Models (SSMs). In this paper, we introduce an alternative selection mechanism inspired by control theory methodologies. Specifically, we propose a novel residual generator for selection, drawing an analogy to fault detection strategies in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike Mamba, which utilizes Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems, our approach combines multiple LTI systems, preserving their beneficial properties during training while achieving comparable selectivity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we test its performance on synthetic tasks. While these tasks are not inherently critical, they serve as benchmarks to test the selectivity properties of different cores architecture. This work highlights the potential of integrating theoretical insights with experimental advancements, offering a complementary perspective to deep learning innovations at the intersection of control theory and machine learning.

<title>LMask: Learn to Solve Constrained Routing Problems with Lazy Masking</title>

Abstract: Routing problems are canonical combinatorial optimization tasks with wide-ranging applications in logistics, transportation, and supply chain management. However, solving these problems becomes significantly more challenging when complex constraints are involved. In this paper, we propose LMask, a novel learning framework that utilizes dynamic masking to generate high-quality feasible solutions for constrained routing problems. LMask introduces the LazyMask decoding method, which lazily refines feasibility masks with the backtracking mechanism. In addition, it employs the refinement intensity embedding to encode the search trace into the model, mitigating representation ambiguities induced by backtracking. To further reduce sampling cost, LMask sets a backtracking budget during decoding, while constraint violations are penalized in the loss function during training to counteract infeasibility caused by this budget. We provide theoretical guarantees for the validity and probabilistic optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments on the traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and TSP with draft limits (TSPDL) demonstrate that LMask achieves state-of-the-art feasibility rates and solution quality, outperforming existing neural methods.

<title>The Nuclear Route: Sharp Asymptotics of ERM in Overparameterized Quadratic Networks</title>

Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.

<title>Mind the Domain Gap: Measuring the Domain Gap Between Real-World and Synthetic Point Clouds for Automated Driving Development</title>

Abstract: Owing to the typical long-tail data distribution issues, simulating domain-gap-free synthetic data is crucial in robotics, photogrammetry, and computer vision research. The fundamental challenge pertains to credibly measuring the difference between real and simulated data. Such a measure is vital for safety-critical applications, such as automated driving, where out-of-domain samples may impact a car's perception and cause fatal accidents. Previous work has commonly focused on simulating data on one scene and analyzing performance on a different, real-world scene, hampering the disjoint analysis of domain gap coming from networks' deficiencies, class definitions, and object representation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measuring the domain gap between the real world sensor observations and simulated data representing the same location, enabling comprehensive domain gap analysis. To measure such a domain gap, we introduce a novel metric DoGSS-PCL and evaluation assessing the geometric and semantic quality of the simulated point cloud. Our experiments corroborate that the introduced approach can be used to measure the domain gap. The tests also reveal that synthetic semantic point clouds may be used for training deep neural networks, maintaining the performance at the 50/50 real-to-synthetic ratio. We strongly believe that this work will facilitate research on credible data simulation and allow for at-scale deployment in automated driving testing and digital twinning.

Abstract: The analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often relies on making some assumption on the variance of the stochastic gradients, which is usually not satisfied or difficult to verify in practice. This paper contributes to a recent line of works which attempt to provide guarantees without making any variance assumption, leveraging only the (strong) convexity and smoothness of the loss functions. In this context, we prove new theoretical bounds derived from the monotonicity of a simple Lyapunov energy, improving the current state-of-the-art and extending their validity to larger step-sizes. Our theoretical analysis is backed by a Performance Estimation Problem analysis, which allows us to claim that, empirically, the bias term in our bounds is tight within our framework.

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.

<title>To Glue or Not to Glue? Classical vs Learned Image Matching for Mobile Mapping Cameras to Textured Semantic 3D Building Models</title>

Abstract: Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion, and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions. Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual localization methods. Link to the code: https://github.com/simBauer/To\_Glue\_or\_not\_to\_Glue

Abstract: Hadamard Product (HP) has long been a cornerstone in click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to capture feature interactions without additional parameters. However, the underlying reasons for its effectiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we revisit HP from the perspective of Quadratic Neural Networks (QNN), which leverage quadratic interaction terms to model complex feature relationships. We further reveal QNN's ability to expand the feature space and provide smooth nonlinear approximations without relying on activation functions. Meanwhile, we find that traditional post-activation does not further improve the performance of the QNN. Instead, mid-activation is a more suitable alternative. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of 25 QNN neuron formats, we identify a good-performing variant and make further enhancements on it. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Head Khatri-Rao Product as a superior alternative to HP and a Self-Ensemble Loss with dynamic ensemble capability within the same network to enhance computational efficiency and performance. Ultimately, we propose a novel neuron format, QNN-alpha, which is tailored for CTR prediction tasks. Experimental results show that QNN-alpha achieves new state-of-the-art performance on six public datasets while maintaining low inference latency, good scalability, and excellent compatibility. The code, running logs, and detailed hyperparameter configurations are available at: https://github.com/salmon1802/QNN.

Abstract: Given a large pool of unlabelled data and a smaller amount of labels, prediction-powered inference (PPI) leverages machine learning predictions to increase the statistical efficiency of standard confidence interval procedures based solely on labelled data, while preserving their fixed-time validity.
  In this paper, we extend the PPI framework to the sequential setting, where labelled and unlabelled datasets grow over time.
  Exploiting Ville's inequality and the method of mixtures, we propose prediction-powered confidence sequence procedures that are valid uniformly over time and naturally accommodate prior knowledge on the quality of the predictions to further boost efficiency.
  We carefully illustrate the design choices behind our method and demonstrate its effectiveness in real and synthetic examples.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the design of model predictive control (MPC) algorithms based on deep operator neural networks (DeepONets). These neural networks are capable of accurately approximating real and complex valued solutions of continuous time nonlinear systems without relying on recurrent architectures. The DeepONet architecture is made up of two feedforward neural networks: the branch network, which encodes the input function space, and the trunk network, which represents dependencies on temporal variables or initial conditions. Utilizing the original DeepONet architecture as a predictor within MPC for Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) systems requires multiple branch networks, to generate multi output predictions, one for each input. Moreover, to predict multiple time steps into the future, the network has to be evaluated multiple times. Motivated by this, we introduce a multi step DeepONet (MS-DeepONet) architecture that computes in one shot multi step predictions of system outputs from multi step input sequences, which is better suited for MPC. We prove that the MS DeepONet is a universal approximator in terms of multi step sequence prediction. Additionally, we develop automated hyper parameter selection strategies and implement MPC frameworks using both the standard DeepONet and the proposed MS DeepONet architectures in PyTorch. The implementation is publicly available on GitHub. Simulation results demonstrate that MS-DeepONet consistently outperforms the standard DeepONet in learning and predictive control tasks across several nonlinear benchmark systems: the van der Pol oscillator, the quadruple tank process, and a cart pendulum unstable system, where it successfully learns and executes multiple swing up and stabilization policies.

Abstract: Reliability and generalization in deep learning are predominantly studied in the context of image classification. Yet, real-world applications in safety-critical domains involve a broader set of semantic tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, which come with a diverse set of dedicated model architectures. To facilitate research towards robust model design in segmentation and detection, our primary objective is to provide benchmarking tools regarding robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial manipulations. We propose the benchmarking tools SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH, along with the most extensive evaluation to date on the reliability and generalization of semantic segmentation and object detection models. In particular, we benchmark 76 segmentation models across four datasets and 61 object detectors across two datasets, evaluating their performance under diverse adversarial attacks and common corruptions. Our findings reveal systematic weaknesses in state-of-the-art models and uncover key trends based on architecture, backbone, and model capacity. SEMSEGBENCH and DETECBENCH are open-sourced in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/benchmarking_reliability_generalization) along with our complete set of total 6139 evaluations. We anticipate the collected data to foster and encourage future research towards improved model reliability beyond classification.

Abstract: Many preference elicitation algorithms consider preference over propositional logic formulas or items with different attributes. In sequential decision making, a user's preference can be a preorder over possible outcomes, each of which is a temporal sequence of events. This paper considers a class of preference inference problems where the user's unknown preference is represented by a preorder over regular languages (sets of temporal sequences), referred to as temporal goals. Given a finite set of pairwise comparisons between finite words, the objective is to learn both the set of temporal goals and the preorder over these goals. We first show that a preference relation over temporal goals can be modeled by a Preference Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA), which is a deterministic finite automaton augmented with a preorder over acceptance conditions. The problem of preference inference reduces to learning the PDFA. This problem is shown to be computationally challenging, with the problem of determining whether there exists a PDFA of size smaller than a given integer $k$, consistent with the sample, being NP-Complete. We formalize the properties of characteristic samples and develop an algorithm that guarantees to learn, given a characteristic sample, the minimal PDFA equivalent to the true PDFA from which the sample is drawn. We present the method through a running example and provide detailed analysis using a robotic motion planning problem.

Abstract: Despite the growing promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in supporting decision-making across domains, fostering appropriate human reliance on AI remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we investigate the utility of exploring distance-based uncertainty scores for task delegation to AI and describe how these scores can be visualized through embedding representations for human-AI decision-making. After developing an AI-based system for physical stroke rehabilitation assessment, we conducted a study with 19 health professionals and 10 students in medicine/health to understand the effect of exploring distance-based uncertainty scores on users' reliance on AI. Our findings showed that distance-based uncertainty scores outperformed traditional probability-based uncertainty scores in identifying uncertain cases. In addition, after exploring confidence scores for task delegation and reviewing embedding-based visualizations of distance-based uncertainty scores, participants achieved an 8.20% higher rate of correct decisions, a 7.15% higher rate of changing their decisions to correct ones, and a 7.14% lower rate of incorrect changes after reviewing AI outputs than those reviewing probability-based uncertainty scores ($p<0.01$). Our findings highlight the potential of distance-based uncertainty scores to enhance decision accuracy and appropriate reliance on AI while discussing ongoing challenges for human-AI collaborative decision-making.

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) are used to analyze individual decision-making in contexts such as transportation choices, political elections, and consumer preferences. DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling inference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution, rather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data. However, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for point and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often underperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite their predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete choice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter estimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty quantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture specifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Our proposed model collapses to behaviorally informed hypotheses when data is limited, mitigating overfitting and instability in underspecified settings while retaining the flexibility to capture complex nonlinear relationships when sufficient data is available. We demonstrate our approach using SGLD through a Monte Carlo simulation study, evaluating both predictive metrics--such as out-of-sample balanced accuracy--and inferential metrics--such as empirical coverage for marginal rates of substitution interval estimates. Additionally, we present results from two empirical case studies: one using revealed mode choice data in NYC, and the other based on the widely used Swiss train choice stated preference data.

Abstract: The success of Deepseek-R1 has drawn the LLM community's attention to reinforcement learning (RL) methods like GRPO. However, such rule-based 0/1 outcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate reasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe overthinking phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward functions to reinforce models' behaviors in producing shorter yet correct completions. Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward functions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length decreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in training. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution GRPO-$\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically adjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among completions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates the need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a switch to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A high ratio maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty while maintaining the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off. On the GSM8K, GPQA, MATH-500, AMC 2023, and AIME 2024 benchmarks, it improves average accuracy by 1.48% while reducing CoT sequence length by 47.3%.

Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.

Abstract: Many interventions, such as vaccines in clinical trials or coupons in online marketplaces, must be assigned sequentially without full knowledge of their effects. Multi-armed bandit algorithms have proven successful in such settings. However, standard independence assumptions fail when the treatment status of one individual impacts the outcomes of others, a phenomenon known as interference. We study optimal-policy learning under interference on a dynamic network. Existing approaches to this problem require repeated observations of the same fixed network and struggle to scale in sample size beyond as few as fifteen connected units -- both limit applications. We show that under common assumptions on the structure of interference, rewards become linear. This enables us to develop a scalable Thompson sampling algorithm that maximizes policy impact when a new $n$-node network is observed each round. We prove a Bayesian regret bound that is sublinear in $n$ and the number of rounds. Simulation experiments show that our algorithm learns quickly and outperforms existing methods. The results close a key scalability gap between causal inference methods for interference and practical bandit algorithms, enabling policy optimization in large-scale networked systems.

Abstract: LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model (ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end, we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation, we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence) self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools, thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set of 10 different models. These phenomenons, while giving developers a powerful way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

Abstract: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.

<title>Lost in the Haystack: Smaller Needles are More Difficult for LLMs to Find</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with needle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has received little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how variations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context question answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity, posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered, fine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three diverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures. Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware LLM-driven systems.

Abstract: We provide a general framework for characterizing the trade-off between accuracy and robustness in supervised learning. We propose a method and define quantities to characterize the trade-off between accuracy and robustness for a given architecture, and provide theoretical insight into the trade-off. Specifically we introduce a simple trade-off curve, define and study an influence function that captures the sensitivity, under adversarial attack, of the optima of a given loss function. We further show how adversarial training regularizes the parameters in an over-parameterized linear model, recovering the LASSO and ridge regression as special cases, which also allows us to theoretically analyze the behavior of the trade-off curve. In experiments, we demonstrate the corresponding trade-off curves of neural networks and how they vary with respect to factors such as number of layers, neurons, and across different network structures. Such information provides a useful guideline to architecture selection.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a common practice in the application of machine learning but is a typically ignored aspect in the literature on privacy-preserving machine learning due to its negative effect on the overall privacy parameter. In this paper, we aim to tackle this fundamental yet challenging problem by providing an effective hyperparameter tuning framework with differential privacy. The proposed method allows us to adopt a broader hyperparameter search space and even to perform a grid search over the whole space, since its privacy loss parameter is independent of the number of hyperparameter candidates. Interestingly, it instead correlates with the utility gained from hyperparameter searching, revealing an explicit and mandatory trade-off between privacy and utility. Theoretically, we show that its additional privacy loss bound incurred by hyperparameter tuning is upper-bounded by the squared root of the gained utility. However, we note that the additional privacy loss bound would empirically scale like a squared root of the logarithm of the utility term, benefiting from the design of doubling step.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a widely-used and powerful learning paradigm for training deep neural networks that allows learning more than one objective by a single backbone. Compared to training tasks separately, MTL significantly reduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances model performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been adopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural language processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging line of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an ultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving impressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches without using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal solutions on real-world problems. In particular, standard training that minimizes the empirical loss on the training data can easily suffer from overfitting to low-resource tasks or be spoiled by noisy-labeled ones, which can cause negative transfer between tasks and overall performance drop. To alleviate such problems, we propose to leverage a recently introduced training method, named Sharpness-aware Minimization, which can enhance model generalization ability on single-task learning. Accordingly, we present a novel MTL training methodology, encouraging the model to find task-based flat minima for coherently improving its generalization capability on all tasks. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of applications to demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach to existing gradient-based MTL methods, as suggested by our developed theory.

Abstract: Reliable and robust evaluation methods are a necessary first step towards developing machine learning models that are themselves robust and reliable. Unfortunately, current evaluation protocols typically used to assess classifiers fail to comprehensively evaluate performance as they tend to rely on limited types of test data, and ignore others. For example, using the standard test data fails to evaluate the predictions made by the classifier to samples from classes it was not trained on. On the other hand, testing with data containing samples from unknown classes fails to evaluate how well the classifier can predict the labels for known classes. This article advocates benchmarking performance using a wide range of different types of data and using a single metric that can be applied to all such data types to produce a consistent evaluation of performance. Using the proposed benchmark it is found that current deep neural networks, including those trained with methods that are believed to produce state-of-the-art robustness, are vulnerable to making mistakes on certain types of data. This means that such models will be unreliable in real-world scenarios where they may encounter data from many different domains, and that they are insecure as they can be easily fooled into making the wrong decisions. It is hoped that these results will motivate the wider adoption of more comprehensive testing methods that will, in turn, lead to the development of more robust machine learning methods in the future.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) performed in an asynchronous manner plays a crucial role in training large-scale machine learning models. However, the generalization performance of asynchronous delayed SGD, which is an essential metric for assessing machine learning algorithms, has rarely been explored. Existing generalization error bounds are rather pessimistic and cannot reveal the correlation between asynchronous delays and generalization. In this paper, we investigate sharper generalization error bound for SGD with asynchronous delay $\tau$. Leveraging the generating function analysis tool, we first establish the average stability of the delayed gradient algorithm. Based on this algorithmic stability, we provide upper bounds on the generalization error of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{T-\tau}{n\tau})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{1}{n})$ for quadratic convex and strongly convex problems, respectively, where $T$ refers to the iteration number and $n$ is the amount of training data. Our theoretical results indicate that asynchronous delays reduce the generalization error of the delayed SGD algorithm. Analogous analysis can be generalized to the random delay setting, and the experimental results validate our theoretical findings.

<title>Achieving Linear Speedup with ProxSkip in Distributed Stochastic Optimization</title>

Abstract: The ProxSkip algorithm for distributed optimization is gaining increasing attention due to its proven benefits in accelerating communication complexity while maintaining robustness against data heterogeneity. However, existing analyses of ProxSkip are limited to the strongly convex setting and do not achieve linear speedup, where convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of nodes. So far, questions remain open about how ProxSkip behaves in the non-convex setting and whether linear speedup is achievable. In this paper, we revisit distributed ProxSkip and address both questions. We demonstrate that the leading communication complexity of ProxSkip is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon^2})$ for non-convex and convex settings, and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{p\sigma^2}{n\epsilon})$ for the strongly convex setting, where $n$ represents the number of nodes, $p$ denotes the probability of communication, $\sigma^2$ signifies the level of stochastic noise, and $\epsilon$ denotes the desired accuracy level. This result illustrates that ProxSkip achieves linear speedup and can asymptotically reduce communication overhead proportional to the probability of communication. Additionally, for the strongly convex setting, we further prove that ProxSkip can achieve linear speedup with network-independent stepsizes.

Abstract: Group equivariant neural networks have proven effective in modelling a wide range of tasks where the data lives in a classical geometric space and exhibits well-defined group symmetries. However, these networks are not suitable for learning from data that lives in a non-commutative geometry, described formally by non-commutative $C^{*}$-algebras, since the $C^{*}$-algebra of continuous functions on a compact matrix group is commutative. To address this limitation, we derive the existence of a new type of equivariant neural network, called compact matrix quantum group equivariant neural networks, which encode symmetries that are described by compact matrix quantum groups. We characterise the weight matrices that appear in these neural networks for the easy compact matrix quantum groups, which are defined by set partitions. As a result, we obtain new characterisations of equivariant weight matrices for some compact matrix groups that have not appeared previously in the machine learning literature.

Abstract: We analyze geometric aspects of the gradient descent algorithm in Deep Learning (DL), and give a detailed discussion of the circumstance that in underparametrized DL networks, zero loss minimization can generically not be attained. As a consequence, we conclude that the distribution of training inputs must necessarily be non-generic in order to produce zero loss minimizers, both for the method constructed in [Chen-Munoz Ewald 2023, 2024], or for gradient descent [Chen 2025] (which assume clustering of training data).

Abstract: Clustering species of the same plant into different groups is an important step in developing new species of the concerned plant. Phenotypic (or physical) characteristics of plant species are commonly used to perform clustering. Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is popularly used for this task, and this algorithm suffers from low accuracy. In one of the recent works (Shastri et al., 2021), the authors have used the standard Spectral Clustering (SC) algorithm to improve the clustering accuracy. They have demonstrated the efficacy of their algorithm on soybean species.
  In the SC algorithm, one of the crucial steps is building the similarity matrix. A Gaussian similarity function is the standard choice to build this matrix. In the past, many works have proposed variants of the Gaussian similarity function to improve the performance of the SC algorithm, however, all have focused on the variance or scaling of the Gaussian. None of the past works have investigated upon the choice of base "e" (Euler's number) of the Gaussian similarity function (natural exponential function).
  Based upon spectral graph theory, specifically the Cheeger's inequality, in this work we propose use of a base "a" exponential function as the similarity function. We also integrate this new approach with the notion of "local scaling" from one of the first works that experimented with the scaling of the Gaussian similarity function (Zelnik-Manor et al., 2004).
  Using an eigenvalue analysis, we theoretically justify that our proposed algorithm should work better than the existing one. With evaluation on 2376 soybean species and 1865 rice species, we experimentally demonstrate that our new SC is 35% and 11% better than the standard SC, respectively.

Abstract: Regression is a fundamental task in machine learning that has garnered extensive attention over the past decades. The conventional approach for regression involves employing loss functions that primarily concentrate on aligning model prediction with the ground truth for each individual data sample. Recent research endeavors have introduced novel perspectives by incorporating label similarity to regression via imposing extra pairwise regularization on the latent feature space and demonstrated the effectiveness. However, there are two drawbacks for those approaches: i) their pairwise operation in latent feature space is computationally more expensive than conventional regression losses; ii) it lacks of theoretical justifications behind such regularization. In this work, we propose GAR (Gradient Aligned Regression) as a competitive alternative method in label space, which is constituted by a conventional regression loss and two pairwise label difference losses for gradient alignment including magnitude and direction. GAR enjoys: i) the same level efficiency as conventional regression loss because the quadratic complexity for the proposed pairwise losses can be reduced to linear complexity; ii) theoretical insights from learning the pairwise label difference to learning the gradient of the ground truth function. We limit our current scope as regression on the clean data setting without noises, outliers or distributional shifts, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method practically on two synthetic datasets and on eight extensive real-world tasks from six benchmark datasets with other eight competitive baselines. Running time experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed GAR over existing methods with pairwise regularization in latent feature space and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component for GAR.

Abstract: Machine learning on large-scale genomic or transcriptomic data is important for many novel health applications. For example, precision medicine tailors medical treatments to patients on the basis of individual biomarkers, cellular and molecular states, etc. However, the data required is sensitive, voluminous, heterogeneous, and typically distributed across locations where dedicated machine learning hardware is not available. Due to privacy and regulatory reasons, it is also problematic to aggregate all data at a trusted third party. Federated learning is a promising solution to this dilemma, because it enables decentralized, collaborative machine learning without exchanging raw data. In this paper, we perform comparative experiments with the federated learning frameworks TensorFlow Federated and Flower. Our test case is the training of disease prognosis and cell type classification models. We train the models with distributed transcriptomic data, considering both data heterogeneity and architectural heterogeneity. We measure model quality, robustness against privacy-enhancing noise and computational performance. We evaluate the resource overhead of a federated system from both client and global perspectives and assess benefits and limitations. Each of the federated learning frameworks has different strengths. However, our experiments confirm that both frameworks can readily build models on transcriptomic data, without transferring personal raw data to a third party with abundant computational resources. This paper is the extended version of https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63772-8_26.

Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model a wide variety of applications ranging from game playing over robotics to finance. Their optimal policy typically maximizes the expected sum of rewards given at each step of the decision process. However, a large class of problems does not fit straightforwardly into this framework: Non-cumulative Markov decision processes (NCMDPs), where instead of the expected sum of rewards, the expected value of an arbitrary function of the rewards is maximized. Example functions include the maximum of the rewards or their mean divided by their standard deviation. In this work, we introduce a general mapping of NCMDPs to standard MDPs. This allows all techniques developed to find optimal policies for MDPs, such as reinforcement learning or dynamic programming, to be directly applied to the larger class of NCMDPs. Focusing on reinforcement learning, we show applications in a diverse set of tasks, including classical control, portfolio optimization in finance, and discrete optimization problems. Given our approach, we can improve both final performance and training time compared to relying on standard MDPs.

Abstract: Numerous real-world decisions rely on machine learning algorithms and require calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, modern methods often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The dominant approach to quantifying the uncertainty inherent in the model is to train an ensemble of separate predictors and measure their empirical variance. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble has high computational cost and memory footprint, especially if the base model itself is already large, like modern transformers. This motivates efforts to develop implicit ensemble methods that emulate the ensemble without explicitly instantiating all its members. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient ensembling method for self-attention networks. It is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), originally developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, and extends it into an implicit ensembling scheme, where all ensemble members share the same, pre-trained self-attention network, but have individual low-rank matrices for the attention projections. The resulting method not only outperforms state-of-the-art implicit techniques like BatchEnsemble, but even matches or exceeds the accuracy of an Explicit Ensemble, while at the same time achieving superior calibration.

<title>Explaining Black-box Model Predictions via Two-level Nested Feature Attributions with Consistency Property</title>

Abstract: Techniques that explain the predictions of black-box machine learning models are crucial to make the models transparent, thereby increasing trust in AI systems. The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.

Abstract: Deep neural network predictions are notoriously difficult to interpret. Feature attribution methods aim to explain these predictions by identifying the contribution of each input feature. Faithfulness, often evaluated using the area over the perturbation curve (AOPC), reflects feature attributions' accuracy in describing the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks. However, many studies rely on AOPC to compare faithfulness across different models, which we show can lead to false conclusions about models' faithfulness. Specifically, we find that AOPC is sensitive to variations in the model, resulting in unreliable cross-model comparisons. Moreover, AOPC scores are difficult to interpret in isolation without knowing the model-specific lower and upper limits. To address these issues, we propose a normalization approach, Normalized AOPC (NAOPC), enabling consistent cross-model evaluations and more meaningful interpretation of individual scores. Our experiments demonstrate that this normalization can radically change AOPC results, questioning the conclusions of earlier studies and offering a more robust framework for assessing feature attribution faithfulness. Our code is available at https://github.com/JoakimEdin/naopc.

Abstract: Many important physical systems can be described as the evolution of a Hamiltonian system, which has the important property of being conservative, that is, energy is conserved throughout the evolution. Physics Informed Neural Networks and in particular Hamiltonian Neural Networks have emerged as a mechanism to incorporate structural inductive bias into the NN model. By ensuring physical invariances are conserved, the models exhibit significantly better sample complexity and out-of-distribution accuracy than standard NNs. Learning the Hamiltonian as a function of its canonical variables, typically position and velocity, from sample observations of the system thus becomes a critical task in system identification and long-term prediction of system behavior. However, to truly preserve the long-run physical conservation properties of Hamiltonian systems, one must use symplectic integrators for a forward pass of the system's simulation. While symplectic schemes have been used in the literature, they are thus far limited to situations when they reduce to explicit algorithms, which include the case of separable Hamiltonians or augmented non-separable Hamiltonians. We extend it to generalized non-separable Hamiltonians, and noting the self-adjoint property of symplectic integrators, we bypass computationally intensive backpropagation through an ODE solver. We show that the method is robust to noise and provides a good approximation of the system Hamiltonian when the state variables are sampled from a noisy observation. In the numerical results, we show the performance of the method concerning Hamiltonian reconstruction and conservation, indicating its particular advantage for non-separable systems.

Abstract: Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call \textit{motifs}. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify \textit{causal} relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (\textbf{motif} \textbf{disco}very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of \textit{Motif Causality (MC)}, inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework on different health data streams and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve partial differential equations using deep learning. However, conventional PINNs perform pointwise predictions that neglect dependencies within a domain, which may result in suboptimal solutions. We introduce SetPINNs, a framework that effectively captures local dependencies. With a finite element-inspired sampling scheme, we partition the domain into sets to model local dependencies while simultaneously enforcing physical laws. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that SetPINNs yield unbiased, lower-variance estimates of residual energy and its gradients, ensuring improved domain coverage and reduced residual error. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks show improved accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

In this work, we integrate concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on diverse datasets, including image data, we demonstrate that the proposed framework produces high-quality geodesics passing through the data support, reliably estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold, and provides a global chart of the manifold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable framework for extracting the complete geometry of the data manifold.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is widely deployed in many popular and impactful Large Language Models. At its core is the attention mechanism for calculating correlations between pairs of tokens. Performing an attention computation takes quadratic time in the input size, and had become the time bottleneck for transformer operations. In order to circumvent this, researchers have used a variety of approaches, including designing heuristic algorithms for performing attention computations faster, and proposing alternatives to the attention mechanism which can be computed more quickly. For instance, state space models such as Mamba were designed to replace attention with an almost linear time alternative.
  In this paper, we prove that any such approach cannot perform important tasks that Transformer is able to perform (assuming a popular conjecture from fine-grained complexity theory). We focus on document similarity tasks, where one is given as input many documents and would like to find a pair which is (approximately) the most similar. We prove that Transformer is able to perform this task, and we prove that this task cannot be performed in truly subquadratic time by any algorithm. Thus, any model which can be evaluated in subquadratic time - whether because of subquadratic-time heuristics for attention, faster attention replacements like Mamba, or any other reason - cannot perform this task. In other words, in order to perform tasks that (implicitly or explicitly) involve document similarity, one may as well use Transformer and cannot avoid its quadratic running time.

Abstract: Foundation models are strong data compressors, but when accounting for their parameter size, their compression ratios are inferior to standard compression algorithms. Naively reducing the parameter count does not necessarily help as it deteriorates predictions and, accordingly, compression. We conduct a large-scale empirical study to find a sweet spot where pre-trained vanilla transformers can achieve competitive compression ratios. To this end, we train models on 165GB of raw byte sequences of either text, image, or audio data (and all possible combinations of the three) and then compress 1GB of out-of-distribution (OOD) data from each modality. We find that relatively small models (millions of parameters) can outperform standard general-purpose compression algorithms (gzip, LZMA2) and even domain-specific compressors (PNG, JPEG-XL, FLAC) $\unicode{x2013}$ even when accounting for parameter size. We achieve, e.g., the lowest compression ratio of 0.49 on OOD audio data (vs. 0.54 for FLAC). We conduct extensive ablations and hyperparameter sweeps to study the impact of model- and dataset scale, and we investigate the effect of unimodal versus multimodal training. We find that even small models can be trained to perform well on multiple modalities, but unlike large-scale foundation models, transfer to unseen modalities is generally weak.

Abstract: We propose Diffusion Model Predictive Control (D-MPC), a novel MPC approach that learns a multi-step action proposal and a multi-step dynamics model, both using diffusion models, and combines them for use in online MPC. On the popular D4RL benchmark, we show performance that is significantly better than existing model-based offline planning methods using MPC (e.g. MBOP) and competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods. We additionally illustrate D-MPC's ability to optimize novel reward functions at run time and adapt to novel dynamics, and highlight its advantages compared to existing diffusion-based planning baselines.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, approaching human perception levels. In this work, we demonstrate that despite these advances, LLMs still struggle to reason using molecular structural information. This gap is critical because many molecular properties, including functional groups, depend heavily on such structural details. To address this limitation, we propose an approach that sketches molecular structures for reasoning. Specifically, we introduce Molecular Structural Reasoning (MSR) framework to enhance the understanding of LLMs by explicitly incorporating the key structural features. We present two frameworks for scenarios where the target molecule is known or unknown. We verify that our MSR improves molecular understanding through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements. Our code is available at https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Erasing-Adversarial-Preservation.

Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying statistically independent factors of the data, is relevant to much of machine learning, from controlled data generation and robust classification to efficient encoding and improving our understanding of the data itself. Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Prior work takes a step towards understanding disentanglement in VAEs by showing diagonal posterior covariance matrices promote orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. Building on this, we close the gap in our understanding of disentanglement by showing how if follows from such orthogonality and equates to factoring the data distribution into statistically independent components.

Abstract: Traditional decision trees are limited by axis-orthogonal splits, which can perform poorly when true decision boundaries are oblique. While oblique decision tree methods address this limitation, they often face high computational costs, difficulties with multi-class classification, and a lack of effective feature selection. In this paper, we introduce LDATree and FoLDTree, two novel frameworks that integrate Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) and Forward ULDA into a decision tree structure. These methods enable efficient oblique splits, handle missing values, support feature selection, and provide both class labels and probabilities as model outputs. Through evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets, LDATree and FoLDTree consistently outperform axis-orthogonal and other oblique decision tree methods, achieving accuracy levels comparable to the random forest. The results highlight the potential of these frameworks as robust alternatives to traditional single-tree methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal AI for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates strong performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.

Abstract: Responsible deployment of language models requires mechanisms for refusing unsafe prompts while preserving model performance. While most approaches modify model weights through additional training, we explore an alternative: steering model activations at inference time via amplifying sparse autoencoder (SAE) features that mediate refusal. This work uncovers a fundamental tension between SAE steering-based safety improvements and general model capabilities. While feature steering successfully improves robustness against both single-turn and challenging multi-turn jailbreak attempts, we discover that this comes at a previously underexplored cost -- systematic degradation of performance across multiple benchmark tasks, even on safe inputs with no apparent connection to refusal behavior. This suggests that features mediating refusal may be more deeply entangled with general language model capabilities than previously understood. Our findings reveal important open questions about the nature of safety-relevant features in language models and the feasibility of isolating them for targeted intervention. While SAE-based steering shows promise as a flexible approach to enhancing language model safety, our results highlight the critical need to understand and address the mechanisms behind these capability tradeoffs before such techniques can be practically deployed.

<title>Load Forecasting for Households and Energy Communities: Are Deep Learning Models Worth the Effort?</title>

Abstract: Energy communities (ECs) play a key role in enabling local demand shifting and enhancing self-sufficiency, as energy systems transition toward decentralized structures with high shares of renewable generation. To optimally operate them, accurate short-term load forecasting is essential, particularly for implementing demand-side management strategies. With the recent rise of deep learning methods, data-driven forecasting has gained significant attention, however, it remains insufficiently explored in many practical contexts. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning models -- including LSTM, xLSTM, and Transformer architectures -- compared to traditional benchmarks such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and persistence forecasting, across varying community size, historical data availability, and model complexity. Additionally, we assess the benefits of transfer learning using publicly available synthetic load profiles. On average, transfer learning improves the normalized mean absolute error by 1.97%pt when only two months of training data are available. Interestingly, for less than six months of training data, simple persistence models outperform deep learning architectures in forecast accuracy. The practical value of improved forecasting is demonstrated using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization for ECs with a shared battery energy storage system. The most accurate deep learning model achieves an average reduction in financial energy costs of 8.06%. Notably, a simple KNN approach achieves average savings of 8.01%, making it a competitive and robust alternative. All implementations are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. These findings offer actionable insights for ECs, and they highlight when the additional complexity of deep learning is warranted by performance gains.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important, as it eliminates reliance on network connections, reduces expensive API calls, and enhances user privacy. However, on-device deployment is challenging due to the limited computational resources of edge devices. In particular, the key bottleneck stems from memory bandwidth constraints related to weight loading. Weight-only quantization effectively reduces memory access, yet often induces significant accuracy degradation. Recent efforts to incorporate sub-branches have shown promise for mitigating quantization errors, but these methods either lack robust optimization strategies or rely on suboptimal objectives. To address these gaps, we propose FeedBack Quantization (FBQuant), a novel approach inspired by negative feedback mechanisms in automatic control. FBQuant inherently ensures that the reconstructed weights remain bounded by the quantization process, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. To further offset the additional latency introduced by sub-branches, we develop an efficient CUDA kernel that decreases 60% of extra inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FBQuant across various LLMs. Notably, for 3-bit Llama2-7B, FBQuant improves zero-shot accuracy by 1.2%.

Abstract: Deep learning models are often trained to approximate dynamical systems that can be modeled using differential equations. Many of these models are optimized to predict one step ahead; such approaches produce calibrated one-step predictions if the predictive model can quantify uncertainty, such as Deep Ensembles. At inference time, multi-step predictions are generated via autoregression, which needs a sound uncertainty propagation method to produce calibrated multi-step predictions. This work introduces an alternative Predictor-Corrector approach named \hop{} that uses Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) to learn the errors of a deterministic Predictor that approximates the dynamical system. The Corrector predicts a set of errors for the Predictor's output based on a context state at any timestep during autoregression. The set of errors creates sharper and well-calibrated prediction intervals with higher predictive accuracy compared to baselines without uncertainty propagation. The calibration and prediction performances are evaluated across a set of dynamical systems. This work is also the first to benchmark existing uncertainty propagation methods based on calibration errors.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.

Abstract: Language model (LLM) post-training, from DPO to distillation, can refine behaviors and unlock new skills, but the open science supporting these post-training techniques is still in its infancy. One limiting factor has been the difficulty of conducting large-scale comparative analyses of synthetic data generating models and LLM judges.

We extend the existing WildChat dataset to include responses not only from GPT, but from over 50 different open-weight models, ranging in size from 0.5B to 104B parameters. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis and demonstrate the potential of this dataset by creating RE-WILD, our own public SFT mix, which outperforms the recent Tulu-3 SFT mixture from Allen AI with only 40% as many samples. Our dataset, samples and code are available at https://github.com/penfever/wildchat-50m.

Abstract: Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance. Our code is published at {https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Adaptive-Guided-Erasure}.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to gradient-based backpropagation methods, particularly for black-box optimization and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. However, ZO methods often suffer from slow convergence due to high-variance stochastic gradient estimators. While subspace perturbations, such as sparsity and low-rank constraints, have been explored to mitigate this issue, their effectiveness remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a \emph{unified theoretical framework} that analyzes both the convergence and generalization properties of ZO optimization under subspace perturbations. We show that high dimensionality is the primary bottleneck and introduce the notion of \textit{subspace alignment} to explain how the subspace perturbations reduce gradient noise and accelerate convergence. Our analysis further shows that a broad class of subspace perturbations exhibits a similar convergence rate, motivating us to prioritize practical considerations in real-world algorithm design. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient ZO method using block coordinate descent (MeZO-BCD), which perturbs and updates only a subset of parameters at each step. Extensive experiments show that MeZO-BCD significantly accelerates optimization, achieving up to $\mathbf{\times2.77}$ speedup in wall-clock time over MeZO on OPT-13B, while maintaining comparable iteration complexity and fine-tuning performance.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.

Abstract: The dynamics of learning in modern large AI systems is hierarchical, often characterized by abrupt, qualitative shifts akin to phase transitions observed in physical systems. While these phenomena hold promise for uncovering the mechanisms behind neural networks and language models, existing theories remain fragmented, addressing specific cases. In this position paper, we advocate for the crucial role of the research direction of parameter symmetries in unifying these fragmented theories. This position is founded on a centralizing hypothesis for this direction: parameter symmetry breaking and restoration are the unifying mechanisms underlying the hierarchical learning behavior of AI models. We synthesize prior observations and theories to argue that this direction of research could lead to a unified understanding of three distinct hierarchies in neural networks: learning dynamics, model complexity, and representation formation. By connecting these hierarchies, our position paper elevates symmetry -- a cornerstone of theoretical physics -- to become a potential fundamental principle in modern AI.

Abstract: We show that the standard discrete update rule of transformer layers can be naturally interpreted as a forward Euler discretization of a continuous dynamical system. Our Transformer Flow Approximation Theorem demonstrates that, under standard Lipschitz continuity assumptions, token representations converge uniformly to the unique solution of an ODE as the number of layers grows. Moreover, if the underlying mapping satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition with a negative constant, the resulting dynamics are contractive, causing perturbations to decay exponentially across layers. Beyond clarifying the empirical stability and expressivity of transformer models, these insights link transformer updates to a broader iterative reasoning framework, suggesting new avenues for accelerated convergence and architectural innovations inspired by dynamical systems theory.

Abstract: In many scientific domains, the cost of data annotation limits the scale and pace of experimentation. Yet, modern machine learning systems offer a promising alternative, provided their predictions yield correct conclusions. We focus on Prediction-Powered Causal Inferences (PPCI), i.e., estimating the treatment effect in a target experiment with unlabeled factual outcomes, retrievable zero-shot from a pre-trained model. We first identify the conditional calibration property to guarantee valid PPCI at population level. Then, we introduce causal lifting, a new causal lifting constraint transferring validity across experiments, which we propose to enforce in practice in Deconfounded Empirical Risk Minimization, our new model-agnostic training objective. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world scientific data, offering solutions to instances not solvable by vanilla Empirical Risk Minimization and invariant training. In particular, we solve zero-shot PPCI on the ISTAnt dataset for the first time, fine-tuning a foundational model on our replica dataset of their ecological experiment with a different recording platform and treatment.

Abstract: Real-world data is often ambiguous; for example, human annotation produces instances with multiple conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning (PLL) aims at training a classifier in this challenging setting, where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels and one correct, but unknown, class label. A multitude of algorithms targeting this setting exists and, to enhance their prediction quality, several extensions that are applicable across a wide range of PLL methods have been introduced. While many of these extensions rely on heuristics, this article proposes a novel enhancing method that incrementally prunes candidate sets using conformal prediction. To work around the missing labeled validation set, which is typically required for conformal prediction, we propose a strategy that alternates between training a PLL classifier to label the validation set, leveraging these predicted class labels for calibration, and pruning candidate labels that are not part of the resulting conformal sets. In this sense, our method alternates between empirical risk minimization and candidate set pruning. We establish that our pruning method preserves the conformal validity with respect to the unknown ground truth. Our extensive experiments on artificial and real-world data show that the proposed approach significantly improves the test set accuracies of several state-of-the-art PLL classifiers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success, but their high memory requirements present challenges for long-context token generation. In this paper we study the streaming complexity of attention approximation, a key computational primitive underlying token generation.
  Our main contribution is BalanceKV, a streaming algorithm for $\epsilon$-approximating attention computations based on geometric process for selecting a balanced collection of Key and Value tokens as per Banaszczyk's vector balancing theory. We complement our algorithm with space lower bounds for streaming attention computation. Besides strong theoretical guarantees, BalanceKV exhibits empirically validated performance improvements over existing methods, both for attention approximation and end-to-end performance on various long context benchmarks.

Abstract: Modern machine learning pipelines are increasingly combining and mixing data from diverse and disparate sources, e.g., pre-training large language models. Yet, finding the optimal data mixture is a challenging and open problem. We formalize this data mixing problem as a bi-level objective: the best mixture is the one that would lead to the best model for a downstream objective. Unfortunately, this objective is generally intractable. In this paper, we make the observation that the bi-level data mixing objective becomes convex as our model class becomes larger. We develop and study a gradient-based approach for optimizing this convex objective, which we call MixMin, and test it on language modeling and chemistry tasks. MixMin was the only method that uniformly improved the data mixture in all our experiments. With MixMin, we improved the data mixture using less than 0.2% additional compute for a pythia-410M model trained on 8.2B tokens, resulting between 1-5% relative improvement to negative log likelihood on PIQA, ARC Easy, SciQ, and OpenWebMath. Crucially, we found that MixMin mixtures for smaller models improved training of larger models, suggesting that MixMin mixtures may be scale-invariant. When mixing bioassay data to train an XGBoost model, we saw improvements to average precision scores of 0.03-0.15.

Abstract: Aircraft manufacturing is the jewel in the crown of industry, in which generating high-fidelity airfoil geometries with controllable and editable representations remains a fundamental challenge. Existing deep learning methods, which typically rely on predefined parametric representations (e.g., B\'ezier) or discrete point sets, face an inherent trade-off between expressive power and resolution adaptability. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FuncGenFoil, a novel function-space generative model that directly reconstructs airfoil geometries as function curves. Our method inherits the advantages of arbitrary-resolution sampling and smoothness from parametric functions, as well as the strong expressiveness of discrete point-based representations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FuncGenFoil improves upon state-of-the-art methods in airfoil generation, achieving a relative 74.4% reduction in label error and a 23.2% increase in diversity on the AF-200K dataset. Our results highlight the advantages of function-space modeling for aerodynamic shape optimization, offering a powerful and flexible framework for high-fidelity airfoil design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced significant advancements to the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. However, as these models continue to scale in size, memory constraints pose substantial challenge. Key and Value cache (KV cache) quantization has been well-documented as a promising solution to this limitation. In this work, we provide two novel theorems aimed at enhancing KV quantization methods. Our first theorem, termed Key-Value Norm Disparity, states that the key weight matrices by nature carry richer information compared to the value weight matrices, as evidenced by higher spectral and Frobenius norms across most of the layers. Our second theorem, Key-Driven Quantization, posits that prioritizing the quantization precision of keys over values induces significant improvements to the overall quantization performance. In particular, assigning greater precision to the keys compared to the values achieves a higher degree of precision reduction with minimal impact on model accuracy. We validate these theorems through theory and extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art LLM architectures and benchmarks. These findings offer valuable guidelines for improving KV cache quantization strategies, facilitating more efficient memory utilization without compromising model performance across diverse NLP tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks are known for their ability to approximate smooth functions, yet they fail to generalize perfectly to unseen inputs when trained on discrete operations. Such operations lie at the heart of algorithmic tasks such as arithmetic, which is often used as a test bed for algorithmic execution in neural networks. In this work, we ask: can neural networks learn to execute binary-encoded algorithmic instructions exactly? We use the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework to study the training dynamics of two-layer fully connected networks in the infinite-width limit and show how a sufficiently large ensemble of such models can be trained to execute exactly, with high probability, four fundamental tasks: binary permutations, binary addition, binary multiplication, and Subtract and Branch if Negative (SBN) instructions. Since SBN is Turing-complete, our framework extends to computable functions. We show how this can be efficiently achieved using only logarithmically many training data. Our approach relies on two techniques: structuring the training data to isolate bit-level rules, and controlling correlations in the NTK regime to align model predictions with the target algorithmic executions.

Abstract: Ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning (ML) systems is crucial as they become increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains. This paper advocates for integrating causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.

Abstract: Continuous control of non-stationary environments is a major challenge for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The time-dependency of the state transition dynamics aggravates the notorious stability problems of model-free deep actor-critic architectures. We posit that two properties will play a key role in overcoming non-stationarity in transition dynamics: (i) preserving the plasticity of the critic network, (ii) directed exploration for rapid adaptation to the changing dynamics. We show that performing on-policy reinforcement learning with an evidential critic provides both of these properties. The evidential design ensures a fast and sufficiently accurate approximation to the uncertainty around the state-value, which maintains the plasticity of the critic network by detecting the distributional shifts caused by the change in dynamics. The probabilistic critic also makes the actor training objective a random variable, enabling the use of directed exploration approaches as a by-product. We name the resulting algorithm as $\textit{ Evidential Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO)}$ due to the integral role of evidential uncertainty quantification in both policy evaluation and policy improvement stages. Through experiments on non-stationary continuous control tasks, where the environment dynamics change at regular intervals, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art on-policy reinforcement learning variants in both task-specific and overall return.

<title>A Little Depth Goes a Long Way: The Expressive Power of Log-Depth Transformers</title>

Abstract: Recent theoretical results show transformers cannot express sequential reasoning problems over long inputs, intuitively because their computational depth is bounded. However, prior work treats the depth as a constant, leaving it unclear to what degree bounded depth may suffice for solving problems over short inputs, or how increasing the transformer's depth affects its expressive power. We address these questions by analyzing transformers whose depth can grow minimally with context length $n$. We show even highly uniform transformers with depth $\Theta(\log n)$ can express two important problems: recognizing regular languages, which captures state tracking abilities and was known to be expressible only by an unconventional, non-uniform model of transformers, and graph connectivity, which underlies multi-step reasoning. Notably, both of these problems cannot be expressed by fixed-depth transformers under standard complexity conjectures, demonstrating the expressivity benefit of growing depth. Moreover, our theory quantitatively predicts how depth must grow with input length to express these problems, showing that depth scaling is more efficient than scaling width or chain-of-thought steps. Empirically, our detailed experiments designed to bridge the expressivity vs. learnability gap reveal that our theoretical depth requirements for regular language recognition closely match the practical depth requirements for successfully training transformers. Thus, our results clarify how depth affects a transformer's reasoning capabilities, and provide practical guidance for effective depth selection for sequential reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of the foundation model era has sparked significant research interest in leveraging pre-trained representations for continual learning (CL), yielding a series of top-performing CL methods on standard evaluation benchmarks. Nonetheless, there are growing concerns regarding potential data contamination during the pre-training stage. Furthermore, standard evaluation benchmarks, which are typically static, fail to capture the complexities of real-world CL scenarios, resulting in saturated performance. To address these issues, we describe CL on dynamic benchmarks (CLDyB), a general computational framework based on Markov decision processes for evaluating CL methods reliably. CLDyB dynamically identifies inherently difficult and algorithm-dependent tasks for the given CL methods, and determines challenging task orders using Monte Carlo tree search. Leveraging CLDyB, we first conduct a joint evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art CL methods, leading to a set of commonly challenging and generalizable task sequences where existing CL methods tend to perform poorly. We then conduct separate evaluations of individual CL methods using CLDyB, discovering their respective strengths and weaknesses. The source code and generated task sequences are publicly accessible at https://github.com/szc12153/CLDyB.

Abstract: Automata-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) has given promising results for learning multi-task policies capable of performing temporally extended objectives given at runtime, done by pretraining and freezing automata embeddings prior to training the downstream policy. However, no theoretical guarantees were given. This work provides a theoretical framework for the automata-conditioned RL problem and shows that it is probably approximately correct learnable. We then present a technique for learning provably correct automata embeddings, guaranteeing optimal multi-task policy learning. Our experimental evaluation confirms these theoretical results.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs) aims to uncover the internal processes of information propagation and reasoning. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated promise in this domain by extracting interpretable and monosemantic features. However, prior works primarily focus on feature extraction from a single layer, failing to effectively capture activations that span multiple layers. In this paper, we introduce Route Sparse Autoencoder (RouteSAE), a new framework that integrates a routing mechanism with a shared SAE to efficiently extract features from multiple layers. It dynamically assigns weights to activations from different layers, incurring minimal parameter overhead while achieving high interpretability and flexibility for targeted feature manipulation. We evaluate RouteSAE through extensive experiments on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. Specifically, under the same sparsity constraint of 64, RouteSAE extracts 22.5% more features than baseline SAEs while achieving a 22.3% higher interpretability score. These results underscore the potential of RouteSAE as a scalable and effective method for LLM interpretability, with applications in feature discovery and model intervention. Our codes are available at https://github.com/swei2001/RouteSAEs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning have achieved widespread success in many domains but remain constrained during real-world deployment. One of the main issues is the additional requirements that were not considered during training. To address this challenge, policy customization has been introduced, aiming to adapt a prior policy while preserving its inherent properties and meeting new task-specific requirements. A principled approach to policy customization is Residual Q-Learning (RQL), which formulates the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and derives a family of value-based learning algorithms. However, RQL has not yet been applied to policy gradient methods, which restricts its applicability, especially in tasks where policy gradient has already proven more effective. In this work, we first derive a concise form of Soft Policy Gradient as a preliminary. Building on this, we introduce Residual Policy Gradient (RPG), which extends RQL to policy gradient methods, allowing policy customization in gradient-based RL settings. With the view of RPG, we rethink the KL-regularized objective widely used in RL fine-tuning. We show that under certain assumptions, KL-regularized objective leads to a maximum-entropy policy that balances the inherent properties and task-specific requirements on a reward-level. Our experiments in MuJoCo demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft Policy Gradient and Residual Policy Gradient.

Abstract: Incorporating permutation equivariance into neural networks has proven to be useful in ensuring that models respect symmetries that exist in data. Symmetric tensors, which naturally appear in statistics, machine learning, and graph theory, are essential for many applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, amongst others. However, existing research on permutation equivariant models has not explored symmetric tensors as inputs, and most prior work on learning from these tensors has focused on equivariance to Euclidean groups. In this paper, we present two different characterisations of all linear permutation equivariant functions between symmetric power spaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show on two tasks that these functions are highly data efficient compared to standard MLPs and have potential to generalise well to symmetric tensors of different sizes.

Abstract: Sampling from an unknown distribution, accessible only through discrete samples, is a fundamental problem at the core of generative AI. The current state-of-the-art methods follow a two-step process: first, estimating the score function (the gradient of a smoothed log-distribution) and then applying a diffusion-based sampling algorithm -- such as Langevin or Diffusion models. The resulting distribution's correctness can be impacted by four major factors: the generalization and optimization errors in score matching, and the discretization and minimal noise amplitude in the diffusion. In this paper, we make the sampling error explicit when using a diffusion sampler in the Gaussian setting. We provide a sharp analysis of the Wasserstein sampling error that arises from these four error sources. This allows us to rigorously track how the anisotropy of the data distribution (encoded by its power spectrum) interacts with key parameters of the end-to-end sampling method, including the number of initial samples, the stepsizes in both score matching and diffusion, and the noise amplitude. Notably, we show that the Wasserstein sampling error can be expressed as a kernel-type norm of the data power spectrum, where the specific kernel depends on the method parameters. This result provides a foundation for further analysis of the tradeoffs involved in optimizing sampling accuracy.

Abstract: The capacity of a foundation model allows for adaptation to new downstream tasks. Weight imprinting is a universal and efficient method to fulfill this purpose. It has been reinvented several times, but it has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we propose a framework for imprinting, identifying three main components: generation, normalization, and aggregation. This allows us to conduct an in-depth analysis of imprinting and a comparison of the existing work. We reveal the benefits of representing novel data with multiple proxies in the generation step and show the importance of proper normalization. We determine proxies through clustering and propose a novel variant of imprinting that outperforms previous work. We motivate this by the neural collapse phenomenon -- an important connection that we can draw for the first time. Our results show an increase of up to 4\% in challenging scenarios with complex data distributions for new classes. Finally, we publicly release our code at https://github.com/DATEXIS/multi-imprinting/.

Abstract: In this work, we employ neural fields, which use neural networks to map a coordinate to the corresponding physical property value at that coordinate, in a test-time learning manner. For a test-time learning method, the weights are learned during the inversion, as compared to traditional approaches which require a network to be trained using a training dataset. Results for synthetic examples in seismic tomography and direct current resistivity inversions are shown first. We then perform a singular value decomposition analysis on the Jacobian of the weights of the neural network (SVD analysis) for both cases to explore the effects of neural networks on the recovered model. The results show that the test-time learning approach can eliminate unwanted artifacts in the recovered subsurface physical property model caused by the sensitivity of the survey and physics. Therefore, NFs-Inv improves the inversion results compared to the conventional inversion in some cases such as the recovery of the dip angle or the prediction of the boundaries of the main target. In the SVD analysis, we observe similar patterns in the left-singular vectors as were observed in some diffusion models, trained in a supervised manner, for generative tasks in computer vision. This observation provides evidence that there is an implicit bias, which is inherent in neural network structures, that is useful in supervised learning and test-time learning models. This implicit bias has the potential to be useful for recovering models in geophysical inversions.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of ride-sourcing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing has fundamentally reshaped urban transportation by offering flexible, on-demand mobility via mobile applications. Despite their convenience, these platforms confront significant operational challenges, particularly vehicle rebalancing - the strategic repositioning of a large group of vehicles to address spatiotemporal mismatches in supply and demand. Inadequate rebalancing not only results in prolonged rider waiting times and inefficient vehicle utilization but also leads to fairness issues, such as the inequitable distribution of service quality and disparities in driver income. To tackle these complexities, we introduce continuous-state mean-field control (MFC) and mean-field reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that employ continuous vehicle repositioning actions. MFC and MFRL offer scalable solutions by modeling each vehicle's behavior through interaction with the vehicle distribution, rather than with individual vehicles. This limits the issues arising from the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional multi-agent methods, enabling coordination across large fleets with significantly reduced computational complexity. To ensure equitable service access across geographic regions, we integrate an accessibility constraint into both models. Extensive empirical evaluation using real-world data-driven simulation of Shenzhen demonstrates the real-time efficiency and robustness of our approach. Remarkably, it scales to tens of thousands of vehicles, with training times comparable to the decision time of a single linear programming rebalancing. Besides, policies generated by our approach effectively explore the efficiency-equity Pareto front, outperforming conventional benchmarks across key metrics like fleet utilization, fulfilled requests, and pickup distance, while ensuring equitable service access.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the LLM instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's memory in the concurrent KV cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's memory. Hogwild! Inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits. We include a codebase implementing aLoRA in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.

Abstract: Modeling the joint distribution of data samples and their properties allows to construct a single model for both data generation and property prediction, with synergistic benefits reaching beyond purely generative or predictive models. However, training joint models presents daunting architectural and optimization challenges. Here, we propose Hyformer, a transformer-based joint model that successfully blends the generative and predictive functionalities, using an alternating attention mechanism and a joint pre-training scheme. We show that Hyformer is simultaneously optimized for molecule generation and property prediction, while exhibiting synergistic benefits in conditional sampling, out-of-distribution property prediction and representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of joint learning in a drug design use case of discovering novel antimicrobial~peptides.

Abstract: Among the many technical challenges to enforcing AI regulations, one crucial yet underexplored problem is the risk of audit manipulation. This manipulation occurs when a platform deliberately alters its answers to a regulator to pass an audit without modifying its answers to other users. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to manipulation-proof auditing by taking into account the auditor's prior knowledge of the task solved by the platform. We first demonstrate that regulators must not rely on public priors (e.g. a public dataset), as platforms could easily fool the auditor in such cases. We then formally establish the conditions under which an auditor can prevent audit manipulations using prior knowledge about the ground truth. Finally, our experiments with two standard datasets illustrate the maximum level of unfairness a platform can hide before being detected as malicious. Our formalization and generalization of manipulation-proof auditing with a prior opens up new research directions for more robust fairness audits.

Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model regression-based approaches.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), explainability is rarely considered during hyperparameter tuning or neural architecture optimization, where the focus remains primarily on minimizing predictive loss. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of XAI consistency, defined as the agreement among different feature attribution methods, and propose new metrics to quantify it. For the first time, we integrate XAI consistency directly into the hyperparameter tuning objective, creating a multi-objective optimization framework that balances predictive performance with explanation robustness. Implemented within the Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT), our approach uses both weighted aggregation and desirability-based strategies to guide model selection. Through our proposed framework and supporting tools, we explore the impact of incorporating XAI consistency into the optimization process. This enables us to characterize distinct regions in the architecture configuration space: one region with poor performance and comparatively low interpretability, another with strong predictive performance but weak interpretability due to low \gls{xai} consistency, and a trade-off region that balances both objectives by offering high interpretability alongside competitive performance. Beyond introducing this novel approach, our research provides a foundation for future investigations into whether models from the trade-off zone-balancing performance loss and XAI consistency-exhibit greater robustness by avoiding overfitting to training performance, thereby leading to more reliable predictions on out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning). Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50% with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately, our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness in clustering aims to balance the proportions of instances assigned to each cluster with respect to a given sensitive attribute. While recently developed fair clustering algorithms optimize clustering objectives under specific fairness constraints, their inherent complexity or approximation often results in suboptimal clustering utility or numerical instability in practice. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair $K$-means clustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii) optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility fair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing methods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and clustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical instability.

Abstract: The composite current source (CCS) model has been adopted as an advanced timing model that represents the current behavior of cells for improved accuracy and better capability than traditional non-linear delay models (NLDM) to model complex dynamic effects and interactions under advanced process nodes. However, the high accuracy requirement, large amount of data and extensive simulation cost pose severe challenges to CCS characterization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) model with active learning(AL) to establish the characterization framework efficiently and accurately. Our approach significantly outperforms conventional commercial tools as well as learning based approaches by achieving an average absolute error of 2.05 ps and a relative error of 2.27% for current waveform of 57 cells under 9 process, voltage, temperature (PVT) corners with TSMC 22nm process. Additionally, our model drastically reduces the runtime to 27% and the storage by up to 19.5x compared with that required by commercial tools.

Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.

Abstract: Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE), a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.

Abstract: By mapping iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks (NNs), deep unfolding networks (DUNs) exhibit well-defined and interpretable structures and achieve remarkable success in the field of compressive sensing (CS). However, most existing DUNs solely rely on the image-domain unfolding, which restricts the information transmission capacity and reconstruction flexibility, leading to their loss of image details and unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a dual-domain optimization framework that combines the priors of (1) image- and (2) convolutional-coding-domains and offers generality to CS and other inverse imaging tasks. By converting this optimization framework into deep NN structures, we present a Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net), which enjoys the ability to efficiently transmit high-capacity self-adaptive convolutional features across all its unfolded stages. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 2D and 3D natural, medical, and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality, superior performance, and generalization ability of our method over other competing approaches and its significant potential in achieving a balance among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability.

Abstract: Random forests (RFs) are among the most popular supervised learning algorithms due to their nonlinear flexibility and ease-of-use. However, as black box models, they can only be interpreted via algorithmically-defined feature importance methods, such as Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI), which have been observed to be highly unstable and have ambiguous scientific meaning. Furthermore, they can perform poorly in the presence of smooth or additive structure. To address this, we reinterpret decision trees and MDI as linear regression and $R^2$ values, respectively, with respect to engineered features associated with the tree's decision splits. This allows us to combine the respective strengths of RFs and generalized linear models in a framework called RF+, which also yields an improved feature importance method we call MDI+. Through extensive data-inspired simulations and real-world datasets, we show that RF+ improves prediction accuracy over RFs and that MDI+ outperforms popular feature importance measures in identifying signal features, often yielding more than a 10% improvement over its closest competitor. In case studies on drug response prediction and breast cancer subtyping, we further show that MDI+ extracts well-established genes with significantly greater stability compared to existing feature importance measures.

Abstract: Active learning is a well-studied approach to learning formal specifications, such as automata. In this work, we extend active specification learning by proposing a novel framework that strategically requests a combination of membership labels and pair-wise preferences, a popular alternative to membership labels. The combination of pair-wise preferences and membership labels allows for a more flexible approach to active specification learning, which previously relied on membership labels only. We instantiate our framework in two different domains, demonstrating the generality of our approach. Our results suggest that learning from both modalities allows us to robustly and conveniently identify specifications via membership and preferences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable impacts across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks. Fine-tuning these pretrained models on downstream datasets provides further significant performance gains; however, this process typically requires a large number of expensive, high-end GPUs. Although there have been efforts focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, they cannot fully unlock the powerful potential of full-parameter fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose QFT, a Quantized Full-parameter Tuning framework for LLMs that quantizes and stores all training states, including weights, gradients, and optimizer states, in INT8 format to reduce training memory, thereby enabling full-parameter fine-tuning on existing GPUs at an affordable cost. To ensure training performance, we make two key efforts: i) for quantized gradients and optimizer states, we theoretically prove that the Lion optimizer, with its property of consistent update magnitudes, is highly robust to quantization; ii) and for quantized weights, we employ the hybrid feature quantizer, which identifies and protects a small subset of sparse critical features while quantizing the remaining dense features, thus ensuring accurate weight updates without FP32 backups. Moreover, to support backpropagation in the integer context, we develop a stack-based gradient flow scheme with O(1) complexity, forming a unified integer training pipeline. As a result, QFT reduces the model state memory to 21% of the standard solution while achieving comparable performance, e.g., tuning a LLaMA-7B model requires only <30GB of memory, making it feasible on a single A6000 GPU.

MIAs complement formal guarantees from differential privacy (DP) under a more realistic adversary model. We analyse MIA vulnerability of fine-tuned neural networks both empirically and theoretically, the latter using a simplified model of fine-tuning. We show that the vulnerability of non-DP models when measured as the attacker advantage at fixed false positive rate reduces according to a simple power law as the number of examples per class increases, even for the most vulnerable points, but the dataset size needed for adequate protection of the most vulnerable points is very large.

To address this, we explore alternative optimization techniques to accelerate training without sacrificing accuracy. Traditional second-order methods like L-BFGS are unsuitable for stochastic settings. We propose a theoretical framework for training neural fields with curvature-aware diagonal preconditioners, demonstrating their effectiveness across tasks such as image reconstruction, shape modeling, and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).

Abstract: Anomaly localization in images (identifying regions that deviate from expected patterns) is vital in applications such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. A recent trend is the use of image generation models in anomaly localization, where these models generate normal-looking counterparts of anomalous images, thereby allowing flexible and adaptive anomaly localization. However, these methods inherit the uncertainty and bias implicitly embedded in the employed generative model, raising concerns about the reliability. To address this, we propose a statistical framework based on selective inference to quantify the significance of detected anomalous regions. Our method provides $p$-values to assess the false positive detection rates, providing a principled measure of reliability. As a proof of concept, we consider anomaly localization using a diffusion model and its applications to medical diagnoses and industrial inspections. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively controls the risk of false positive detection, supporting its use in high-stakes decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Tensor-based discrete density estimation requires flexible modeling and proper divergence criteria to enable effective learning; however, traditional approaches using $\alpha$-divergence face analytical challenges due to the $\alpha$-power terms in the objective function, which hinder the derivation of closed-form update rules. We present a generalization of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, called E$^2$M algorithm. It circumvents this issue by first relaxing the optimization into minimization of a surrogate objective based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is tractable via the standard EM algorithm, and subsequently applying a tensor many-body approximation in the M-step to enable simultaneous closed-form updates of all parameters. Our approach offers flexible modeling for not only a variety of low-rank structures, including the CP, Tucker, and Tensor Train formats, but also their mixtures, thus allowing us to leverage the strengths of different low-rank structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in classification and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires powerful, flexible and efficiently trainable models to be successful in solving challenging problems. We introduce density quantum neural networks, a model family that prepares mixtures of trainable unitaries, with a distributional constraint over coefficients. This framework balances expressivity and efficient trainability, especially on quantum hardware. For expressivity, the Hastings-Campbell Mixing lemma converts benefits from linear combination of unitaries into density models with similar performance guarantees but shallower circuits. For trainability, commuting-generator circuits enable density model construction with efficiently extractable gradients. The framework connects to various facets of QML including post-variational and measurement-based learning. In classical settings, density models naturally integrate the mixture of experts formalism, and offer natural overfitting mitigation. The framework is versatile - we uplift several quantum models into density versions to improve model performance, or trainability, or both. These include Hamming weight-preserving and equivariant models, among others. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings.

<title>Mitigate Position Bias in Large Language Models via Scaling a Single Dimension</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

<title>Enhancing Large-Scale AI Training Efficiency: The C4 Solution for Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Communication Optimization</title>

arXiv:2406.04594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the adoption of distributed training techniques, involving the deployment of thousands of GPUs to train a single model. Unfortunately, the efficiency of large-scale distributed training systems is often suboptimal due to the increased likelihood of hardware errors in high-end GPU products and the heightened risk of network traffic collisions. Moreover, any local hardware failure can disrupt training tasks, and the inability to swiftly identify faulty components leads to a significant waste of GPU resources. And, prolonged communication due to traffic collisions can substantially increase GPU waiting times. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-driven solution, namely the C4. The key insights of C4 are twofold. First, the load in distributed training exhibits homogeneous characteristics and is divided into iterations through periodic synchronization, therefore hardware anomalies would incur certain syndrome in collective communication. By leveraging this feature, C4 can rapidly identify the faulty components, swiftly isolate the anomaly, and restart the task, thereby avoiding resource wastage caused by delays in anomaly detection. Second, the predictable communication model of collective communication, involving a limited number of long-lived flows, allows C4 to efficiently execute traffic planning, substantially reducing bandwidth competition among these flows. The C4 has been extensively deployed across real-world production systems in a hyperscale cloud provider, yielding a significant improvement in system efficiency, from 30% to 45%. This enhancement is attributed to a 30% reduction in error-induced overhead and a 15% reduction in communication costs.

<title>Tracing Representation Progression: Analyzing and Enhancing Layer-Wise Similarity</title>

Abstract: Analyzing the similarity of internal representations has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, with similarity increasing when layers get closer. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon under the geodesic curve assumption for the learned transformer. We then show that an increase in representation similarity implies an increase in predicted probability when directly applying the last-layer classifier to any hidden layer representation. We then propose an aligned training method to improve the effectiveness of shallow layer by enhancing the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) more early saturation events, (2) layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models. We conduct experiments on both vision and NLP tasks to demonstrate the performance of the proposed aligned training.

arXiv:2406.15968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the transparency and fair use of the data used in their pretraining. Detecting such content is challenging due to the scale of the data and limited exposure of each instance during training. We propose ReCaLL (Relative Conditional Log-Likelihood), a novel membership inference attack (MIA) to detect LLMs' pretraining data by leveraging their conditional language modeling capabilities. ReCaLL examines the relative change in conditional log-likelihoods when prefixing target data points with non-member context. Our empirical findings show that conditioning member data on non-member prefixes induces a larger decrease in log-likelihood compared to non-member data. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that ReCaLL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiMIA dataset, even with random and synthetic prefixes, and can be further improved using an ensemble approach. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLMs' behavior with different membership contexts, providing insights into how LLMs leverage membership information for effective inference at both the sequence and token level.

<title>Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements</title>

arXiv:2407.07368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.

arXiv:2407.20444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality instruction data for effective alignment, particularly in code generation tasks where expert curated datasets are expensive to produce. We present Genetic-Instruct, a scalable algorithm for synthesizing large-scale, high quality coding instructions using evolutionary principles. Starting from a small set of seed instructions, Genetic-Instruct generates diverse and challenging instruction-code pairs by leveraging an Instructor-LLM for generation, a Coder-LLM for code synthesis, and a Judge-LLM for automatic quality evaluation. Our proposed approach is highly parallelizable and effective even with a small seed data and weaker generator models. We generated more than 7.5 million coding instructions with the proposed approach. Then we evaluated it by fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic samples and demonstrated a significant improvement in their code generation capability compared to the other synthetic generation approaches and publicly available datasets. Our results highlight the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the Genetic-Instruct framework.

arXiv:2409.04463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We showcase the application of our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we model the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach.

arXiv:2409.04491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aimed to enhance protein sequence classification using natural language processing (NLP) techniques while addressing the impact of sequence similarity on model performance. We compared various machine learning and deep learning models under two different data-splitting strategies: random splitting and ECOD family-based splitting, which ensures evolutionary-related sequences are grouped together. Methods: The study evaluated models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Na\"ive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting and Stacking classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and transformer models (BertForSequenceClassification, DistilBERT, and ProtBert). Performance was tested using different amino acid ranges and sequence lengths with a focus on generalization across unseen evolutionary families. Results: The Voting classifier achieved the highest performance with 74% accuracy, 74% weighted F1 score, and 65% macro F1 score under random splitting, while ProtBERT obtained 77% accuracy, 76% weighted F1 score, and 61% macro F1 score among transformer models. However, performance declined across all models when tested using ECOD-based splitting, revealing the impact of sequence similarity on classification performance. Conclusion: Advanced NLP techniques, particularly ensemble methods like Voting classifiers, and transformer models show significant potential in protein classification, with sufficient training data and sequence similarity management being crucial for optimal performance. However, the use of biologically meaningful splitting methods, such as ECOD family-based splitting, is crucial for realistic performance evaluation and generalization to unseen evolutionary families.

<title>From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2409.11704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark, exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter, competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms and evaluating models.

arXiv:2410.14535v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing presence of dynamic scenarios, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications, radio propagation modeling tools must adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the radio channel. Recently, both Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing frameworks have emerged to address these challenges. However, there is often confusion about how these approaches differ and which one should be used in specific contexts. In this paper, we provide an overview of these two techniques and a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art tools: 3DSCAT from UniBo and Sionna from NVIDIA. To provide a more precise characterization of the scope of these methods, we introduce a novel simulation-based metric, the Multipath Lifetime Map, which enables the evaluation of spatial and temporal coherence in radio channels only based on the geometrical description of the environment. Finally, our metrics are evaluated on a classic urban street canyon scenario, yielding similar results to those obtained from measurement campaigns.

Abstract: The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning--commonly used in multi-task models--affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: We create two German-only decoder models, LL\"aMmlein 120M and 1B, transparently from scratch and publish them, along with the training data, for the German NLP research community to use. The model training involved several key steps, including extensive data preprocessing, the creation of a custom German tokenizer, the training itself, as well as the evaluation of the final models on various benchmarks. Throughout the training process, multiple checkpoints were saved and analyzed using the SuperGLEBer benchmark to monitor the models' learning dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art models on the SuperGLEBer benchmark, both LL\"aMmlein models performed competitively, consistently matching or surpassing models with similar parameter sizes. The results show that the models' quality scales with size as expected, but performance improvements on some tasks plateaued early, offering valuable insights into resource allocation for future model development.

arXiv:2411.15643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and engineering problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been heavily studied in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it is still challenging to move forward from understanding to controlling the unknown PDE dynamics. PDE boundary control instantiates a simplified but important problem by only focusing on PDE boundary conditions as the control input and output. However, current model-free PDE controllers cannot ensure the boundary output satisfies some given user-specified safety constraint. To this end, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee the boundary output stays within the safe set for current model-free controllers. Specifically, we first introduce a neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF) to ensure the feasibility of the trajectory-wise constraint satisfaction of boundary output. Based on the neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary control input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF depends linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic programming-based safety filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free controllers. Extensive experiments under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and Navier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments validate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving better general performance and boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the vanilla and constrained model-free controller baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/safe-pde-control.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.16598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) has become a cornerstone defense against adversarial examples (AEs), regarded as robust due to its use of diffusion models (DMs) that project AEs onto the natural data manifold. We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, attributing it to two critical flaws: incorrect gradients and inappropriate evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that with proper accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient flaws that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.

arXiv:2411.19557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adapters have become standard for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a learnable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using \textbf{27-90} times fewer learnable parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RaghavSinghal10/lora-sb.

<title>Forensics Adapter: Unleashing CLIP for Generalizable Face Forgery Detection</title>

arXiv:2411.19715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe Forensics Adapter, an adapter network designed to transform CLIP into an effective and generalizable face forgery detector. Although CLIP is highly versatile, adapting it for face forgery detection is non-trivial as forgery-related knowledge is entangled with a wide range of unrelated knowledge. Existing methods treat CLIP merely as a feature extractor, lacking task-specific adaptation, which limits their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce an adapter to learn face forgery traces -- the blending boundaries unique to forged faces, guided by task-specific objectives. Then we enhance the CLIP visual tokens with a dedicated interaction strategy that communicates knowledge across CLIP and the adapter. Since the adapter is alongside CLIP, its versatility is highly retained, naturally ensuring strong generalizability in face forgery detection. With only 5.7M trainable parameters, our method achieves a significant performance boost, improving by approximately 7% on average across five standard datasets. Additionally, we describe Forensics Adapter++, an extended method that incorporates textual modality via a newly proposed forgery-aware prompt learning strategy. This extension leads to a further 1.3% performance boost over the original Forensics Adapter. We believe the proposed methods can serve as a baseline for future CLIP-based face forgery detection methods. The codes have been released at https://github.com/OUC-VAS/ForensicsAdapter.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a benchmark to pressure-test today's frontier models' multimodal decision-making capabilities in the very long-context regime (up to one million tokens) and investigate whether these models can learn from large numbers of expert demonstrations in their context. We evaluate the performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and o1 as policies across a battery of simple interactive decision-making tasks: playing tic-tac-toe, chess, and Atari, navigating grid worlds, solving crosswords, and controlling a simulated cheetah. We study increasing amounts of expert demonstrations in the context $\unicode{x2013}$ from no demonstrations to 512 full episodes. Across our tasks, models rarely manage to fully reach expert performance, and often, presenting more demonstrations has little effect. Some models steadily improve with more demonstrations on a few tasks. We investigate the effect of encoding observations as text or images and the impact of chain-of-thought prompting. To help quantify the impact of other approaches and future innovations, we open source our benchmark that covers the zero-, few-, and many-shot regimes in a unified evaluation.

Abstract: We present a conformal inference method for constructing lower prediction bounds for survival times from right-censored data, extending recent approaches designed for more restrictive type-I censoring scenarios. The proposed method imputes unobserved censoring times using a machine learning model, and then analyzes the imputed data using a survival model calibrated via weighted conformal inference. This approach is theoretically supported by an asymptotic double robustness property. Empirical studies on simulated and real data demonstrate that our method leads to relatively informative predictive inferences and is especially robust in challenging settings where the survival model may be inaccurate.

<title>Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models</title>

Abstract: Advancing planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the key prerequisites towards unlocking their potential for performing reliably in complex and impactful domains. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate this across board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex), and we show that search-based planning can yield significant improvements in LLM game-playing strength. We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external game engine, and in internal search, the model is trained to generate in-context a linearized tree of search and a resulting final choice. Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, reliably capturing the transition and value functions in the respective environments, with minimal hallucinations. We evaluate our LLM search implementations against game-specific state-of-the-art engines, showcasing substantial improvements in strength over the base model, and reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating closer to the human search budget. Our proposed approach, combining search with domain knowledge, is not specific to board games, hinting at more general future applications.

Abstract: Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, the observed dispersion in rotation rates for similar coeval stars has historically been difficult to characterize. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of $\approx$8,000 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages. These contribute an additional 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We apply ChronoFlow to estimate ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 6709, and the Theia 456 stellar stream. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow is publicly available at https://github.com/philvanlane/chronoflow.

Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum framework for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, grounded in the quantum principles and leveraging a fully quantum model of the classical Markov Decision Process (MDP). By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.

Abstract: This research employs Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) alongside differentiable physics to model viscoelastic fluids, merging conventional differential equations, neural networks and numerical methods to reconstruct missing terms in constitutive models. This study focuses on analyzing four viscoelastic models: Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM), Johnson-Segalman, Giesekus, and Exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (ePTT), through the use of synthetic datasets. The methodology was tested across different experimental conditions, including oscillatory and startup flows. While the UDE framework effectively predicts shear and normal stresses for most models, it demonstrates some limitations when applied to the ePTT model. The findings underscore the potential of UDEs in fluid mechanics while identifying critical areas for methodological improvement. Also, a model distillation approach was employed to extract simplified models from complex ones, emphasizing the versatility and robustness of UDEs in rheological modeling.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have shown promise in enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). However, their integration into multimodal reasoning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we take the first step toward unlocking the potential of PRMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning. We identify three key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality reasoning data constrains the capabilities of foundation Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which imposes further limitations on the upper bounds of TTS and reinforcement learning (RL); (2) a lack of automated methods for process labeling within multimodal contexts persists; (3) the employment of process rewards in unimodal RL faces issues like reward hacking, which may extend to multimodal scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce URSA, a three-stage Unfolding multimodal Process-Supervision Aided training framework. We first construct MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality large-scale multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning dataset, to build a stronger math reasoning foundation MLLM, URSA-8B. Subsequently, we go through an automatic process to synthesize process supervision data, which emphasizes both logical correctness and perceptual consistency. We introduce DualMath-1.1M to facilitate the training of URSA-8B-RM. Finally, we propose Process-Supervised Group-Relative-Policy-Optimization (PS-GRPO), pioneering a multimodal PRM-aided online RL method that outperforms vanilla GRPO. With PS-GRPO application, URSA-8B-PS-GRPO outperforms Gemma3-12B and GPT-4o by 8.4% and 2.7% on average across 6 benchmarks. Code, data and checkpoint can be found at https://github.com/URSA-MATH.

<title>FIT-Print: Towards False-claim-resistant Model Ownership Verification via Targeted Fingerprint</title>

arXiv:2501.15509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model fingerprinting is a widely adopted approach to safeguard the copyright of open-source models by detecting and preventing their unauthorized reuse without modifying the protected model. However, in this paper, we reveal that existing fingerprinting methods are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of third-party non-reused models. We find that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by this finding, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively. Experiments on benchmark models and datasets verify the effectiveness, conferrability, and resistance to false claim attacks of our FIT-Print.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, the application of machine learning approaches to time-series forecasting of climate dynamical phenomena has become increasingly active. It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system. As an application, we predict the multi-year dynamics of the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation with the prediction horizon of 24 months using only past time series.

arXiv:2501.18283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Random Feature Representation Boosting (RFRBoost), a novel method for constructing deep residual random feature neural networks (RFNNs) using boosting theory. RFRBoost uses random features at each layer to learn the functional gradient of the network representation, enhancing performance while preserving the convex optimization benefits of RFNNs. In the case of MSE loss, we obtain closed-form solutions to greedy layer-wise boosting with random features. For general loss functions, we show that fitting random feature residual blocks reduces to solving a quadratically constrained least squares problem. Through extensive numerical experiments on tabular datasets for both regression and classification, we show that RFRBoost significantly outperforms RFNNs and end-to-end trained MLP ResNets in the small- to medium-scale regime where RFNNs are typically applied. Moreover, RFRBoost offers substantial computational benefits, and theoretical guarantees stemming from boosting theory.

<title>REG: Rectified Gradient Guidance for Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2501.18865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.

<title>Adversarial Robustness in Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer: Algorithms and Guarantees</title>

arXiv:2502.01027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.

Abstract: Auto-bidding problem under a strict return-on-spend constraint (ROSC) is considered, where an algorithm has to make decisions about how much to bid for an ad slot depending on the revealed value, and the hidden allocation and payment function that describes the probability of winning the ad-slot depending on its bid. The objective of an algorithm is to maximize the expected utility (product of ad value and probability of winning the ad slot) summed across all time slots subject to the total expected payment being less than the total expected utility, called the ROSC. A (surprising) impossibility result is derived that shows that no online algorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret even when the value, allocation and payment function are drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The problem is non-trivial even when the revealed value remains constant across time slots, and an algorithm with regret guarantee that is optimal up to logarithmic factor is derived.

arXiv:2502.06574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semivalue-based data valuation uses cooperative-game theory intuitions to assign each data point a value reflecting its contribution to a downstream task. Still, those values depend on the practitioner's choice of utility, raising the question: How robust is semivalue-based data valuation to changes in the utility? This issue is critical when the utility is set as a trade-off between several criteria and when practitioners must select among multiple equally valid utilities. We address it by introducing the notion of a dataset's spatial signature: given a semivalue, we embed each data point into a lower-dimensional space where any utility becomes a linear functional, making the data valuation framework amenable to a simpler geometric picture. Building on this, we propose a practical methodology centered on an explicit robustness metric that informs practitioners whether and by how much their data valuation results will shift as the utility changes. We validate this approach across diverse datasets and semivalues, demonstrating strong agreement with rank-correlation analyses and offering analytical insight into how choosing a semivalue can amplify or diminish robustness.

arXiv:2502.06661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature importance measures are widely studied and are essential for understanding model behavior, guiding feature selection, and enhancing interpretability. However, many machine learning fitted models involve complex interactions between features. Existing feature importance metrics fail to capture these pairwise or higher-order effects, while existing interaction metrics often suffer from limited applicability or excessive computation; no methods exist to conduct statistical inference for feature interactions. To bridge this gap, we first propose a new model-agnostic metric, interaction Leave-One-Covariate-Out (iLOCO), for measuring the importance of pairwise feature interactions, with extensions to higher-order interactions. Next, we leverage recent advances in LOCO inference to develop distribution-free and assumption-light confidence intervals for our iLOCO metric. To address computational challenges, we also introduce an ensemble learning method for calculating the iLOCO metric and confidence intervals that we show is both computationally and statistically efficient. We validate our iLOCO metric and our confidence intervals on both synthetic and real data sets, showing that our approach outperforms existing methods and provides the first inferential approach to detecting feature interactions.

Abstract: High-resolution whole-brain in vivo MR imaging at mesoscale resolutions remains challenging due to long scan durations, motion artifacts, and limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study proposes Rotating-view super-resolution (ROVER)-MRI, an unsupervised framework based on multi-scale implicit neural representations (INR), enabling efficient recovery of fine anatomical details from multi-view thick-slice acquisitions. ROVER-MRI employs coordinate-based neural networks to implicitly and continuously encode image structures at multiple spatial scales, simultaneously modeling anatomical continuity and correcting inter-view motion through an integrated registration mechanism. Validation on ex-vivo monkey brain data and multiple in-vivo human datasets demonstrates substantially improved reconstruction performance compared to bicubic interpolation and state-of-the-art regularized least-squares super-resolution reconstruction (LS-SRR) with 2-fold reduction in scan time. Notably, ROVER-MRI achieves an unprecedented whole-brain in-vivo T2-weighted imaging at 180 micron isotropic resolution in only 17 minutes of scan time on a 7T scanner with 22.4% lower relative error compared to LS-SRR. We also demonstrate improved SNR using ROVER-MRI compared to a time-matched 3D GRE acquisition. Quantitative results on several datasets demonstrate better sharpness of the reconstructed images with ROVER-MRI for different super-resolution factors (5 to 11). These findings highlight ROVER-MRI's potential as a rapid, accurate, and motion-resilient mesoscale imaging solution, promising substantial advantages for neuroimaging studies.

<title>CopySpec: Accelerating LLMs with Speculative Copy-and-Paste Without Compromising Quality</title>

arXiv:2502.08923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CopySpec, a simple yet effective technique to tackle the inefficiencies LLMs face when generating responses that closely resemble previous outputs or responses that can be verbatim extracted from context. CopySpec identifies repeated sequences in the model's chat history or context and speculates that the same tokens will follow, enabling seamless copying without compromising output quality and without requiring additional GPU memory. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using seven LLMs and five datasets: MT-Bench, CNN/DM, GSM8K, HumanEval, and our newly created dataset, MT-Redundant. MT-Redundant, introduced in this paper, transforms the second turn of MT-Bench into a request for variations of the first turn's answer, simulating real-world scenarios where users request modifications to prior responses. Our results demonstrate significant speed-ups: up to 2.35x on CNN/DM, 3.08x on the second turn of select MT-Redundant categories, and 2.66x on the third turn of GSM8K's self-correction tasks. Importantly, we show that CopySpec integrates seamlessly with speculative decoding, yielding an average 49% additional speed-up over speculative decoding for the second turn of MT-Redundant across all eight categories. While LLMs, even with speculative decoding, suffer from slower inference as context size grows, CopySpec leverages larger contexts to accelerate inference, making it a faster complementary solution. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/RazvanDu/CopySpec.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world personalized applications through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanisms to supplement their responses with domain-specific knowledge. However, the valuable and often proprietary nature of the knowledge bases used in RAG introduces the risk of unauthorized usage by adversaries. Existing methods that can be generalized as watermarking techniques to protect these knowledge bases typically involve poisoning or backdoor attacks. However, these methods require altering the LLM's results of verification samples, inevitably making these watermarks susceptible to anomaly detection and even introducing new security risks. To address these challenges, we propose \name{} for `harmless' copyright protection of knowledge bases. Instead of manipulating LLM's final output, \name{} implants distinct yet benign verification behaviors in the space of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, maintaining the correctness of the final answer. Our method has three main stages: (1) Generating CoTs: For each verification question, we generate two `innocent' CoTs, including a target CoT for building watermark behaviors; (2) Optimizing Watermark Phrases and Target CoTs: Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we optimize them to minimize retrieval errors under the \emph{black-box} and \emph{text-only} setting of suspicious LLM, ensuring that only watermarked verification queries can retrieve their correspondingly target CoTs contained in the knowledge base; (3) Ownership Verification: We exploit a pairwise Wilcoxon test to verify whether a suspicious LLM is augmented with the protected knowledge base by comparing its responses to watermarked and benign verification queries. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} effectively protects knowledge bases and its resistance to adaptive attacks.

<title>Unveiling Downstream Performance Scaling of LLMs: A Clustering-Based Perspective</title>

arXiv:2502.17262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating scale and cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) training necessitate accurate pre-training prediction of downstream task performance for efficient resource allocation. This is challenged by: 1) the emergence phenomenon, where metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, hindering prediction by smaller models; and 2) uneven task difficulty and inconsistent performance scaling patterns, leading to high metric variability. Current prediction methods lack accuracy and reliability. We propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) framework for downstream performance prediction. The COD framework clusters tasks by their difficulty scaling features, thereby establishing a more stable and predictable support subset through the exclusion of tasks exhibiting non-emergent behavior or irregular scaling. We adopt a performance scaling law to predict cluster-wise performance with theoretical support. Predictable subset performance acts as an intermediate predictor for the full evaluation set. We further derive a mapping function to accurately extrapolate the performance of the subset to the full set. Applied to an LLM with 70B parameters, COD achieved a 1.36% average prediction error across eight key LLM benchmarks, offering actionable insights for resource allocation and training monitoring of LLMs pretraining.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) have demonstrated their efficacy in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing evaluation benchmarks often assume a single optimal approach to leveraging retrieved information, failing to account for varying user needs. This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework that systematically assesses RALMs under three user need cases-Context-Exclusive, Context-First, and Memory-First-across three distinct context settings: Context Matching, Knowledge Conflict, and Information Irrelevant. By varying both user instructions and the nature of retrieved information, our approach captures the complexities of real-world applications where models must adapt to diverse user requirements. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA datasets, including HotpotQA, DisentQA, and our newly constructed synthetic URAQ dataset, we find that restricting memory usage improves robustness in adversarial retrieval conditions but decreases peak performance with ideal retrieval results and model family dominates behavioral differences. Our findings highlight the necessity of user-centric evaluations in the development of retrieval-augmented systems and provide insights into optimizing model performance across varied retrieval contexts. We will release our code and URAQ dataset upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate CCR evaluation for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.

Abstract: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to accelerate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Existing 3D geometric learning models based on point clouds, voxels, meshes, or graphs depend on explicit geometric representations that are memory-intensive and resolution-limited. For large-scale simulations with millions of nodes and cells, existing models require aggressive downsampling due to their dependence on mesh resolution, resulting in degraded accuracy. We present TripNet, a triplane-based neural framework that implicitly encodes 3D geometry into a compact, continuous feature map with fixed dimension. Unlike mesh-dependent approaches, TripNet scales to high-resolution simulations without increasing memory cost, and enables CFD predictions at arbitrary spatial locations in a query-based fashion, independent of mesh connectivity or predefined nodes. TripNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DrivAerNet and DrivAerNet++ datasets, accurately predicting drag coefficients, surface pressure, and full 3D flow fields. With a unified triplane backbone supporting multiple simulation tasks, TripNet offers a scalable, accurate, and efficient alternative to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate models.

<title>MFH: A Multi-faceted Heuristic Algorithm Selection Approach for Software Verification</title>

Abstract: Currently, many verification algorithms are available to improve the reliability of software systems. Selecting the appropriate verification algorithm typically demands domain expertise and non-trivial manpower. An automated algorithm selector is thus desired. However, existing selectors, either depend on machine-learned strategies or manually designed heuristics, encounter issues such as reliance on high-quality samples with algorithm labels and limited scalability. In this paper, an automated algorithm selection approach, namely MFH, is proposed for software verification. Our approach leverages the heuristics that verifiers producing correct results typically implement certain appropriate algorithms, and the supported algorithms by these verifiers indirectly reflect which ones are potentially applicable. Specifically, MFH embeds the code property graph (CPG) of a semantic-preserving transformed program to enhance the robustness of the prediction model. Furthermore, our approach decomposes the selection task into the sub-tasks of predicting potentially applicable algorithms and matching the most appropriate verifiers. Additionally, MFH also introduces a feedback loop on incorrect predictions to improve model prediction accuracy. We evaluate MFH on 20 verifiers and over 15,000 verification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MFH, achieving a prediction accuracy of 91.47% even without ground truth algorithm labels provided during the training phase. Moreover, the prediction accuracy decreases only by 0.84% when introducing 10 new verifiers, indicating the strong scalability of the proposed approach.

<title>Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets</title>

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. By controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval systems introduces new attack surfaces, particularly for adversarial ranking manipulations. We present $\textbf{StealthRank}$, a novel adversarial attack method that manipulates LLM-driven ranking systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within item or document descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target items while avoiding explicit manipulation traces. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven ranking systems. Our code is publicly available at $\href{https://github.com/Tangyiming205069/controllable-seo}{here}$.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.

<title>MMInference: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context VLMs via Modality-Aware Permutation Sparse Attention</title>

Abstract: The integration of long-context capabilities with visual understanding unlocks unprecedented potential for Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, the quadratic attention complexity during the pre-filling phase remains a significant obstacle to real-world deployment. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MMInference (Multimodality Million tokens Inference), a dynamic sparse attention method that accelerates the prefilling stage for long-context multi-modal inputs. First, our analysis reveals that the temporal and spatial locality of video input leads to a unique sparse pattern, the Grid pattern. Simultaneously, VLMs exhibit markedly different sparse distributions across different modalities. We introduce a permutation-based method to leverage the unique Grid pattern and handle modality boundary issues. By offline search the optimal sparse patterns for each head, MMInference constructs the sparse distribution dynamically based on the input. We also provide optimized GPU kernels for efficient sparse computations. Notably, MMInference integrates seamlessly into existing VLM pipelines without any model modifications or fine-tuning. Experiments on multi-modal benchmarks-including Video QA, Captioning, VisionNIAH, and Mixed-Modality NIAH-with state-of-the-art long-context VLMs (LongVila, LlavaVideo, VideoChat-Flash, Qwen2.5-VL) show that MMInference accelerates the pre-filling stage by up to 8.3x at 1M tokens while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/MMInference.

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual, organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

Abstract: We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a composition of functions $f\circ g$ where $g:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq d$, and $f : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are built in a two stage procedure. For a fixed $g$, we build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$. Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds, involving evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$ may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide sub-optimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training Poincar\'e inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation errors, especially for rather small training sets and $m=1$.

<title>X-Transfer Attacks: Towards Super Transferable Adversarial Attacks on CLIP</title>

Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Abstract: Understanding a dynamical system fundamentally relies on establishing an appropriate Hamiltonian function and elucidating its symmetries. By formulating agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables, we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games, and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game theory and machine learning.

<title>Model Selection for Gaussian-gated Gaussian Mixture of Experts Using Dendrograms of Mixing Measures</title>

arXiv:2505.13052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models constitute a widely utilized class of ensemble learning approaches in statistics and machine learning, known for their flexibility and computational efficiency. They have become integral components in numerous state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures, particularly for analyzing heterogeneous data across diverse domains. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of model selection, especially concerning the optimal number of mixture components or experts, remains limited and poses significant challenges. These challenges primarily stem from the inclusion of covariates in both the Gaussian gating functions and expert networks, which introduces intrinsic interactions governed by partial differential equations with respect to their parameters. In this paper, we revisit the concept of dendrograms of mixing measures and introduce a novel extension to Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE models that enables consistent estimation of the true number of mixture components and achieves the pointwise optimal convergence rate for parameter estimation in overfitted scenarios. Notably, this approach circumvents the need to train and compare a range of models with varying numbers of components, thereby alleviating the computational burden, particularly in high-dimensional or deep neural network settings. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately recovering the number of experts. It outperforms common criteria such as the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood, while achieving optimal convergence rates for parameter estimation and accurately approximating the regression function.

Abstract: We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.

Summary:<br /><br />SHAP zero is a new algorithm that addresses the need for interpretable predictions in machine learning models for biological sequences. By amortizing the cost of Shapley value computation across large datasets, SHAP zero significantly reduces the computational burden of extracting global biological insights. The algorithm leverages the sparse Fourier transform of the model to uncover high-order feature interactions, leading to faster and more efficient explanation of predictions for models of guide RNA efficacy, DNA repair outcomes, and protein fitness. SHAP zero enables the exploration of rich combinatorial interactions that were previously inaccessible at scale, offering a scalable and principled approach to interpretability for black-box sequence models in biology.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning models for biological sequences has intensified the need for interpretable predictions, with Shapley values emerging as a theoretically grounded standard for model explanation. While effective for local explanations of individual input sequences, scaling Shapley-based interpretability to extract global biological insights requires evaluating thousands of sequences--incurring exponential computational cost per query. We introduce SHAP zero, a novel algorithm that amortizes the cost of Shapley value computation across large-scale biological datasets. After a one-time model sketching step, SHAP zero enables near-zero marginal cost for future queries by uncovering an underexplored connection between Shapley values, high-order feature interactions, and the sparse Fourier transform of the model. Applied to models of guide RNA efficacy, DNA repair outcomes, and protein fitness, SHAP zero explains predictions orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, recovering rich combinatorial interactions previously inaccessible at scale. This work opens the door to principled, efficient, and scalable interpretability for black-box sequence models in biology.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework called ELU-GCN that enhances the performance of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The first stage of ELU-GCN involves graph learning to create a new graph structure, known as ELU-graph, which facilitates the positive influence of additional label information on GCN predictions. In the second stage, a graph contrastive learning approach is employed to further improve representation learning by comparing the learned ELU graph with the original graph and exploring their consistency and mutually exclusive information. The theoretical analysis provided in the article demonstrates that the proposed method can enhance the generalization ability of GCNs. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of ELU-GCN in comparison to existing methods.

Abstract: The message-passing mechanism of graph convolutional networks (i.e., GCNs) enables label information to reach more unlabeled neighbors, thereby increasing the utilization of labels. However, the additional label information does not always contribute positively to the GCN. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (i.e., ELU-graph), which allows the additional label information to positively influence the predictions of GCN. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.

Summary: 
UrbanMind is a spatial-temporal Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed for accurate and robust prediction of multifaceted urban dynamics. It introduces Muffin-MAE, a masked autoencoder that captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies, and a semantic-aware prompting strategy to encode contextual details for improved reasoning. The framework includes a test time adaptation mechanism with a data reconstructor to enhance generalization by adjusting to unseen test data. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets show that UrbanMind outperforms existing methods in accuracy and generalization, even in zero-shot scenarios. By effectively integrating multifaceted spatial-temporal data and addressing distributional shifts between training and testing data, UrbanMind demonstrates strong potential for practical applications in urban planning, transportation management, and public service optimization.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting urban dynamics is crucial for managing transportation systems, optimizing urban planning, and enhancing public services. While neural network-based approaches have achieved success, they often rely on task-specific architectures and large volumes of data, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse urban scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, yet their application to spatial-temporal urban dynamics remains underexplored. Existing LLM-based methods struggle to effectively integrate multifaceted spatial-temporal data and fail to address distributional shifts between training and testing data, limiting their predictive reliability in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose UrbanMind, a novel spatial-temporal LLM framework for multifaceted urban dynamics prediction that ensures both accurate forecasting and robust generalization. At its core, UrbanMind introduces Muffin-MAE, a multifaceted fusion masked autoencoder with specialized masking strategies that capture intricate spatial-temporal dependencies and intercorrelations among multifaceted urban dynamics. Additionally, we design a semantic-aware prompting and fine-tuning strategy that encodes spatial-temporal contextual details into prompts, enhancing LLMs' ability to reason over spatial-temporal patterns. To further improve generalization, we introduce a test time adaptation mechanism with a test data reconstructor, enabling UrbanMind to dynamically adjust to unseen test data by reconstructing LLM-generated embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets across multiple cities demonstrate that UrbanMind consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high accuracy and robust generalization, even in zero-shot settings.

<div> Detection framework, Deep neural networks, Adversarial examples, Layer-wise inconsistencies, Lightweight

Summary: 
The article introduces a lightweight detection framework for adversarial examples in deep neural networks. Adversarial examples are subtle perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions in DNNs. The proposed framework leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target model itself, based on the A Few Large Shifts Assumption. Two strategies, Recovery Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT), are introduced to expose internal disruptions caused by adversaries. The method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets under standard and adaptive threat models. The framework requires only benign data for calibration and does not compromise clean accuracy. The code for the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. Overall, the approach offers efficient and effective detection of adversarial examples without the need for external models or complex architectures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex architectures, heavy augmentations, or adversarial data, limiting their efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial perturbations typically induce large representation shifts in a small subset of layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to expose internal disruptions caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with negligible computational overhead and no compromise to clean accuracy. The code is available here: https://github.com/c0510gy/AFLS-AED.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Adaptive Mode Learning (AML) framework to enhance the adaptive thinking ability of language agents during dynamic social interactions. It identifies hierarchical thinking modes based on cognitive control theory and employs the Adaptive Mode Policy Optimization (AMPO) algorithm to optimize context-aware mode switching and reasoning. AML improves social intelligence simulation through multi-granular thinking mode design, context-aware mode switching, and token-efficient reasoning. Experiment results show that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than GPT-4o and outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. This highlights the effectiveness of adaptive thinking mode selection and optimization in AMPO over fixed-depth solutions like GRPO. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current studies. Existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning uniformly across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inflexible social simulation. To address this, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) framework in this paper, aiming to improve the adaptive thinking ability of language agents in dynamic social interactions. To this end, we first identify hierarchical thinking modes ranging from intuitive response to deep deliberation based on the cognitive control theory. We then develop the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm to optimize the context-aware mode switching and reasoning. Our framework advances existing research in three key aspects: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence benchmarks verify that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than GPT-4o. Notably, our AMPO outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains, demonstrating the advantage of adaptive thinking mode selection and optimization mechanism in AMPO over GRPO's fixed-depth solution.

<div> Graph Transformers, Tokenized Graph Learning Models, Large Language Models, Learnable Graph Token List, hop-overpriority problem
Summary:
Graph Transformers have improved graph machine learning but face high complexity. Tokenized Graph Learning Models (TGLMs) convert graphs into token lists for scalable processing. Existing TGLMs use hand-designed token lists but struggle with balancing local and global signals, especially in heterophilic graphs. To address this, the Learnable Graph Token List (LGTL) is proposed, adapting weights and prioritizing nodes for adaptively emphasizing informative nodes. LGTL can mitigate the hop-overpriority problem and has been validated across Graph Transformers and Graph Large Language Models through empirical and theoretical studies. The LGTL module shows promising results in handling diverse graph learning scenarios, improving the performance of models on benchmarks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers, leveraging the global attention to capture long-range dependencies in graph structures, have significantly advanced graph machine learning, but face prohibitive computational complexity. Tokenized Graph Learning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered token lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are also employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed token lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical preliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an unexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists overemphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local and global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic graphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List (LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs. Specifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes informative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a selection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can be adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides, we theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both Graph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones.

<div> Bayesian neural networks, deep ensembles, uncertainty quantification, last layer empirical Bayes, normalizing flow  
Summary:  
The article discusses the challenges of quantifying uncertainty in neural network predictions and introduces the last layer empirical Bayes (LLEB) approach. LLEB utilizes a learnable prior in the form of a normalizing flow on the last layer to maximize the evidence lower bound. It bridges the gap between Bayesian neural networks and deep ensembles by varying the strength of the prior used. LLEB demonstrates comparable performance to existing methods, suggesting that empirical Bayes is a promising avenue for future research in uncertainty quantification. <div>

Abstract: The task of quantifying the inherent uncertainty associated with neural network predictions is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles are among the most prominent approaches to tackle this task. Both approaches produce predictions by computing an expectation of neural network outputs over some distribution on the corresponding weights; this distribution is given by the posterior in the case of BNNs, and by a mixture of point masses for ensembles. Inspired by recent work showing that the distribution used by ensembles can be understood as a posterior corresponding to a learned data-dependent prior, we propose last layer empirical Bayes (LLEB). LLEB instantiates a learnable prior as a normalizing flow, which is then trained to maximize the evidence lower bound; to retain tractability we use the flow only on the last layer. We show why LLEB is well motivated, and how it interpolates between standard BNNs and ensembles in terms of the strength of the prior that they use. LLEB performs on par with existing approaches, highlighting that empirical Bayes is a promising direction for future research in uncertainty quantification.

<div> quantization, Large Language Models, Round-to-Nearest, token generation throughput, data precision format
Summary: 
Quantization is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Round-to-Nearest (RTN) is a simple quantization technique that is cost-effective and can offer better token generation throughput compared to advanced methods. While newer quantization methods claim superiority, this work argues that RTN is a practical choice for quantizing LLMs. By implementing RTN based on Marlin kernels and selectively increasing data precision format for certain model layers, accuracy can be improved gradually. RTN is cheaper to apply and can achieve similar accuracy to more advanced alternatives. This study challenges the notion that RTN is inferior and demonstrates its viability as a quantization method for LLMs.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization became a necessary tool for serving ever-increasing Large Language Models (LLMs). RTN (Round-to-Nearest) is perhaps the simplest quantization technique that has been around well before LLMs surged to the forefront of machine learning (ML) research. Yet, it has been largely dismissed by recent and more advanced quantization methods that claim superiority over RTN in nearly every aspect of performance. This work aims to dispel this established point of view, showing that RTN is not only much cheaper to apply, but also its token generation throughput can be better than and accuracy can be similar to more advanced alternatives. In particular, we discuss our implementation of RTN based on the recent Marlin kernels and demonstrate how the accuracy of RTN can be gradually improved by selectively increasing the data precision format of certain model layers and modules. Based on our results, we argue that RTN presents a viable and practical choice for quantizing LLMs.

arXiv:2505.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models rely heavily on consistent and accurate performance metrics to evaluate and compare their effectiveness. However, existing libraries often suffer from fragmentation, inconsistent implementations, and insufficient data validation protocols, leading to unreliable results. Existing libraries have often been developed independently and without adherence to a unified standard, particularly concerning the specific tasks they aim to support. As a result, each library tends to adopt its conventions for metric computation, input/output formatting, error handling, and data validation protocols. This lack of standardization leads to both implementation differences (ID) and reporting differences (RD), making it difficult to compare results across frameworks or ensure reliable evaluations. To address these issues, we introduce AllMetrics, an open-source unified Python library designed to standardize metric evaluation across diverse ML tasks, including regression, classification, clustering, segmentation, and image-to-image translation. The library implements class-specific reporting for multi-class tasks through configurable parameters to cover all use cases, while incorporating task-specific parameters to resolve metric computation discrepancies across implementations. Various datasets from domains like healthcare, finance, and real estate were applied to our library and compared with Python, Matlab, and R components to identify which yield similar results. AllMetrics combines a modular Application Programming Interface (API) with robust input validation mechanisms to ensure reproducibility and reliability in model evaluation. This paper presents the design principles, architectural components, and empirical analyses demonstrating the ability to mitigate evaluation errors and to enhance the trustworthiness of ML workflows.

Summary:
MoRE-Brain introduces a neuro-inspired framework for visual reconstruction from fMRI data. It utilizes a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture based on brain network principles to enhance interpretability. The model encodes fMRI signals into the CLIP space and synthesizes images using a finetuned diffusion model guided by a dual-stage routing mechanism. This approach allows for efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks and adapting subject-specific routers. MoRE-Brain provides insights into how different brain regions contribute to the reconstructed image's semantic and spatial attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's high reconstruction fidelity and effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from generative priors. Overall, MoRE-Brain represents a significant advancement in fMRI-based visual decoding, offering a more generalizable and interpretable approach to understanding human perception and developing brain-computer interfaces.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.

Summary: 
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are frequently used to interpret the internal workings of large language models (LLMs) by translating them into understandable concept representations. While current evaluations of SAEs primarily focus on metrics like reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff and feature disentanglement, they often neglect the importance of robustness in concept representations. The authors argue that the robustness of concept representations, reflecting the accuracy of concept labeling, is crucial. They introduce a framework to assess robustness by creating scenarios with adversarial perturbations that manipulate SAE representations. Through their experiments, they demonstrate that even small adversarial input changes can significantly influence concept-based interpretations, while the base LLM outputs remain unaffected. They conclude that SAE concept representations are vulnerable and may not be suitable for tasks requiring model monitoring and oversight. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human (auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations. Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for applications in model monitoring and oversight.

Abstract: We introduce GradPCA, an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method that exploits the low-rank structure of neural network gradients induced by Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) alignment. GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled spectral OOD detectors.

Summary: 
Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to speed up sampling in diffusion models by training a student model to mimic the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model. This study reinterprets trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. Signal shrinkage occurs during merging due to discretization and limited optimization of the student model. A dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to compute the optimal merging strategy to maximize signal fidelity. A sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy is observed, influenced by data covariance structures. These findings enhance the understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and provide insights for improving distillation strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Eikonal Solvers, a novel framework that integrates Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) with Neural Eikonal Solvers. Our approach employs a single neural field where a unified shared backbone is conditioned on signal-specific latent variables - represented as point clouds in a Lie group - to model diverse Eikonal solutions. The ENF integration ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability. This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting Eikonal solution. By coupling these steerable representations with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our framework accurately models Eikonal travel-time solutions while generalizing to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds with regular group actions. This includes homogeneous spaces such as Euclidean, position-orientation, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. We validate our approach through applications in seismic travel-time modeling of 2D and 3D benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, scalability, adaptability, and user controllability compared to existing Neural Operator-based Eikonal solver methods.

<br />
Summary: This work introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a method for enhancing Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The approach involves training a GNN to guide SAT solver branching heuristics by assigning variable weights and polarities in a single forward pass. By treating this guidance as a reinforcement learning problem and using policy-gradient methods, the GNN is trained based on the solver's computational cost as the reward signal. Evaluations show that the RLAF-trained policies lead to a substantial reduction in solve times for various base solvers on diverse SAT problems, with some cases achieving over a 2x speedup. These policies also demonstrate effective generalization to larger and more challenging problems post-training, outperforming expert-supervised approaches that rely on handcrafted heuristics. This approach signals a promising direction for data-driven heuristic design in combinatorial optimization. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are foundational to computer science, yet their performance typically hinges on hand-crafted heuristics. This work introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a paradigm for learning to guide SAT solver branching heuristics with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Central to our approach is a novel and generic mechanism for injecting inferred variable weights and polarities into the branching heuristics of existing SAT solvers. In a single forward pass, a GNN assigns these parameters to all variables. Casting this one-shot guidance as a reinforcement learning problem lets us train the GNN with off-the-shelf policy-gradient methods, such as GRPO, directly using the solver's computational cost as the sole reward signal. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that RLAF-trained policies significantly reduce the mean solve times of different base solvers across diverse SAT problem distributions, achieving more than a 2x speedup in some cases, while generalizing effectively to larger and harder problems after training. Notably, these policies consistently outperform expert-supervised approaches based on learning handcrafted weighting heuristics, offering a promising path towards data-driven heuristic design in combinatorial optimization.

<div> Cache hit rate, memory-efficient, Mixture-of-Experts, language models, local routing consistency <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study focuses on measuring the local routing consistency of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in large language models (LLMs) to enable efficient deployment on memory-constrained devices. Two metrics, SRP and SCH, are introduced to evaluate the performance and cache hit rate of segment-level routing in MoE models. Findings indicate that models applying MoE on every layer without shared experts demonstrate the highest local routing consistency. Domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones. Most models achieve a balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes around 2x the active experts. These insights pave the way for designing and deploying memory-efficient MoE models without compromising inference speed.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance (SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

Summary:
The paper introduces mesh-free SINDy, an algorithm that uses neural network approximation and auto-differentiation to identify governing equations from non-uniform temporal data sampling. It is robust to high noise levels and limited data, requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. The approach is demonstrated on various PDEs, including the Burgers' equation, heat equation, Korteweg-De Vries equation, and 2D advection-diffusion equation. Mesh-free SINDy successfully identifies PDEs even with high noise levels and limited data, achieving accurate results with up to 75% noise for the Burgers' equation using 5,000 samples and as few as 100 samples with 1% noise, all within a training time of under one minute. Previous state-of-the-art methods are also compared, showcasing the effectiveness and efficiency of mesh-free SINDy. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Identifying the governing equations of a dynamical system is one of the most important tasks for scientific modeling. However, this procedure often requires high-quality spatio-temporal data uniformly sampled on structured grids. In this paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the power of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to identify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform temporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise levels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our implementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of hyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many scientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its effectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat equation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion equation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying the noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to previous state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise and low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery, achieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers' equation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise. All of this is achieved within a training time of under one minute.

Abstract: We introduce Model Feedback Learning (MFL), a novel test-time optimization framework for optimizing inputs to pre-trained AI models or deployed hardware systems without requiring any retraining of the models or modifications to the hardware. In contrast to existing methods that rely on adjusting model parameters, MFL leverages a lightweight reverse model to iteratively search for optimal inputs, enabling efficient adaptation to new objectives under deployment constraints. This framework is particularly advantageous in real-world settings, such as semiconductor manufacturing recipe generation, where modifying deployed systems is often infeasible or cost-prohibitive. We validate MFL on semiconductor plasma etching tasks, where it achieves target recipe generation in just five iterations, significantly outperforming both Bayesian optimization and human experts. Beyond semiconductor applications, MFL also demonstrates strong performance in chemical processes (e.g., chemical vapor deposition) and electronic systems (e.g., wire bonding), highlighting its broad applicability. Additionally, MFL incorporates stability-aware optimization, enhancing robustness to process variations and surpassing conventional supervised learning and random search methods in high-dimensional control settings. By enabling few-shot adaptation, MFL provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for deploying intelligent control in real-world environments.

Summary:
Merge to Mix is a novel method that accelerates the process of composing dataset mixtures for fine-tuning large models. By leveraging model merging, which combines the abilities of individually fine-tuned models, Merge to Mix can effectively select dataset mixtures without requiring full fine-tuning on each candidate mixture.

Model merging plays a key role in serving as a surrogate for fine-tuning on the entire mixture, enhancing the efficiency of dataset composition. With Merge to Mix, the process of maximizing performance on downstream tasks through dataset mixing becomes more streamlined and effective, providing a novel solution to the challenges faced in fine-tuning large models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing datasets for fine-tuning large models (LMs) has become critical for maximizing performance on downstream tasks. However, composing effective dataset mixtures typically relies on heuristics and trial-and-error, often requiring multiple fine-tuning runs to achieve the desired outcome. We propose a novel method, $\textit{Merge to Mix}$, that accelerates composing dataset mixtures through model merging. Model merging is a recent technique that combines the abilities of multiple individually fine-tuned LMs into a single LM by using a few simple arithmetic operations. Our key insight is that merging models individually fine-tuned on each dataset in a mixture can effectively serve as a surrogate for a model fine-tuned on the entire mixture. Merge to Mix leverages this insight to accelerate selecting dataset mixtures without requiring full fine-tuning on each candidate mixture. Our experiments demonstrate that Merge to Mix surpasses state-of-the-art methods in dataset selection for fine-tuning LMs.

Summary:
The new bidirectional variational autoencoder (BVAE) network architecture utilizes a single neural network for both encoding and decoding processes, in contrast to traditional encoder-decoder pairs. By encoding in the forward direction and decoding in the backward direction through the same synaptic connections, the BVAE demonstrates efficiency by significantly reducing the parameter count while still achieving superior performance compared to standard unidirectional VAEs. Simulations conducted on various image tasks, including image reconstruction, classification, interpolation, and generation using datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA-64, showcased the BVAE's capabilities. The bidirectional structure of BVAEs proved to be a promising approach in enhancing VAE performance, making it a potential advancement in neural network architecture for image processing tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present the new bidirectional variational autoencoder (BVAE) network architecture. The BVAE uses a single neural network both to encode and decode instead of an encoder-decoder network pair. The network encodes in the forward direction and decodes in the backward direction through the same synaptic web. Simulations compared BVAEs and ordinary VAEs on the four image tasks of image reconstruction, classification, interpolation, and generation. The image datasets included MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA-64 face images. The bidirectional structure of BVAEs cut the parameter count by almost 50% and still slightly outperformed the unidirectional VAEs.

<br />
Summary: 
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to extract interpretable features from neural network activations. However, a single SAE may only capture a limited subset of features due to variations in weight initializations. To address this limitation, the study proposes ensembling multiple SAEs using naive bagging and boosting techniques. By integrating SAEs trained with different initial weights or minimizing residual errors sequentially, the ensemble methods enhance feature diversity, reconstruction quality, and stability. Experimental results across various language model settings and SAE architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of ensembling SAEs for tasks such as concept detection and removing spurious correlations. The ensemble approach outperforms individual SAEs, showcasing its practical utility in improving downstream applications. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations into human-interpretable features. Typically, features learned by a single SAE are used for downstream applications. However, it has recently been shown that SAEs trained with different initial weights can learn different features, demonstrating that a single SAE captures only a limited subset of features that can be extracted from the activation space. Motivated by this limitation, we propose to ensemble multiple SAEs through naive bagging and boosting. Specifically, SAEs trained with different weight initializations are ensembled in naive bagging, whereas SAEs sequentially trained to minimize the residual error are ensembled in boosting. We evaluate our ensemble approaches with three settings of language models and SAE architectures. Our empirical results demonstrate that ensembling SAEs can improve the reconstruction of language model activations, diversity of features, and SAE stability. Furthermore, ensembling SAEs performs better than applying a single SAE on downstream tasks such as concept detection and spurious correlation removal, showing improved practical utility.

<br />Summary: 
The article introduces FR-Mamba, a novel framework for spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction in physical systems. It combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model (SSM) to capture global spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies efficiently. By leveraging the Mamba architecture for SSM and FNO for non-local spatial features, FR-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods in flow field reconstruction tasks. The hybrid neural network architecture achieves high-accuracy performance on long sequences of physical system data. <div>
arXiv:2505.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical field reconstruction (PFR) aims to predict the state distribution of physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure, and temperature) based on limited sensor measurements. It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail to capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal performance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose FR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on state space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model (SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture, to model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In parallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by leveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations extracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field distribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field reconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning is applied to analyze the stock market by determining the best time to buy and potentially sell stocks within a given timeframe. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem is defined using real-world data for training the model, with insights from relevant papers. Agents are trained using Q-Learning techniques and deep Q-Learning, along with machine learning regression and classification models to predict stock prices. The agents are compared to evaluate their convergence on a policy for maximizing profit in the stock market. <div>

Abstract: Much research has been done to analyze the stock market. After all, if one can determine a pattern in the chaotic frenzy of transactions, then they could make a hefty profit from capitalizing on these insights. As such, the goal of our project was to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to determine the best time to buy a stock within a given time frame. With only a few adjustments, our model can be extended to identify the best time to sell a stock as well. In order to use the format of free, real-world data to train the model, we define our own Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. These two papers [5] [6] helped us in formulating the state space and the reward system of our MDP problem. We train a series of agents using Q-Learning, Q-Learning with linear function approximation, and deep Q-Learning. In addition, we try to predict the stock prices using machine learning regression and classification models. We then compare our agents to see if they converge on a policy, and if so, which one learned the best policy to maximize profit on the stock market.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a framework for modeling Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with external tools to determine the trustworthiness of responses. In scenarios where LLMs require external tools for accurate answers, uncertainty quantification becomes crucial. The proposed framework considers the predictive uncertainty of both the LLM and the external tool to enhance trust in the combined system. Efficient approximations are introduced to make uncertainty computation practical for real-world applications. The framework is evaluated on synthetic question answering datasets and applied to retrieval-augmented generation systems, showing effectiveness in scenarios requiring external information retrieval. This work addresses the challenge of assessing uncertainty in LLM-based systems, especially when external tools are needed for generating reliable responses. <div>
arXiv:2505.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often require external tools, such as machine learning classifiers or knowledge retrieval systems, to provide accurate answers in domains where their pre-trained knowledge is insufficient. This integration of LLMs with external tools expands their utility but also introduces a critical challenge: determining the trustworthiness of responses generated by the combined system. In high-stakes applications, such as medical decision-making, it is essential to assess the uncertainty of both the LLM's generated text and the tool's output to ensure the reliability of the final response. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods do not account for the tool-calling scenario, where both the LLM and external tool contribute to the overall system's uncertainty. In this work, we present a novel framework for modeling tool-calling LLMs that quantifies uncertainty by jointly considering the predictive uncertainty of the LLM and the external tool. We extend previous methods for uncertainty quantification over token sequences to this setting and propose efficient approximations that make uncertainty computation practical for real-world applications. We evaluate our framework on two new synthetic QA datasets, derived from well-known machine learning datasets, which require tool-calling for accurate answers. Additionally, we apply our method to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and conduct a proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our uncertainty metrics in scenarios where external information retrieval is needed. Our results show that the framework is effective in enhancing trust in LLM-based systems, especially in cases where the LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient and external tools are required.

<div> Conformal Prediction, Uncertainty Quantification, Machine Learning, Fairness, Sensitive Attributes<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the concept of Conformal Fairness, which aims to address fairness issues in machine learning models by incorporating sensitive attributes. By leveraging the exchangeability assumption instead of the typical IID assumption, the proposed framework can be applied to various data types, including non-IID data like graphs. The algorithm ensures controlled fairness-related gaps and coverage aligned with theoretical expectations. Experimental results on both graph and tabular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in promoting fairness while providing probabilistic guarantees. This research contributes to the growing field of fair machine learning by offering a method to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in predictive models. <div>
arXiv:2505.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification with machine learning models. While conformal prediction provides probabilistic guarantees regarding the coverage of the true label, these guarantees are agnostic to the presence of sensitive attributes within the dataset. In this work, we formalize \textit{Conformal Fairness}, a notion of fairness using conformal predictors, and provide a theoretically well-founded algorithm and associated framework to control for the gaps in coverage between different sensitive groups. Our framework leverages the exchangeability assumption (implicit to CP) rather than the typical IID assumption, allowing us to apply the notion of Conformal Fairness to data types and tasks that are not IID, such as graph data. Experiments were conducted on graph and tabular datasets to demonstrate that the algorithm can control fairness-related gaps in addition to coverage aligned with theoretical expectations.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, reasoning efficiency, token budget allocation, adaptive scheduling, plan-and-budget <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper addresses the inefficiency in inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a theoretical model called the Bayesian Budget Allocation Model (BBAM). It identifies overthinking and underthinking as prevalent issues in LLMs and proposes the $E^3$ metric to measure the trade-off between correctness and computation efficiency. Utilizing BBAM, the Plan-and-Budget framework is introduced as a test-time strategy to enhance reasoning efficiency by decomposing queries into sub-questions and allocating token budgets based on estimated complexity through adaptive scheduling. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, token reduction, and the $E^3$ metric, with the framework even enabling a smaller model to perform comparably to a larger one. Plan-and-Budget's model-agnostic approach showcases its effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance and closing performance gaps without requiring retraining. The code for implementation is also made available for further exploration and application. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close performance gaps without retraining. Our code is available at anonymous.4open.science/r/P-and-B-6513/.

This study introduces a new approach to address the limitations of existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods in deep learning. IRM aims to learn invariant representations for better out-of-distribution generalization but often falls short compared to empirical risk minimization (ERM). The researchers identify that IRM is sensitive to limited environment diversity and over-parameterization, leading to performance degradation. To combat this issue, they propose an extrapolation-based framework that introduces synthetic distributional shifts to enhance environmental diversity. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and over-parameterized scenarios, the new method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Invariant risk minimization (IRM) aims to enable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in deep learning by learning invariant representations. As IRM poses an inherently challenging bi-level optimization problem, most existing approaches -- including IRMv1 -- adopt penalty-based single-level approximations. However, empirical studies consistently show that these methods often fail to outperform well-tuned empirical risk minimization (ERM), highlighting the need for more robust IRM implementations. This work theoretically identifies a key limitation common to many IRM variants: their penalty terms are highly sensitive to limited environment diversity and over-parameterization, resulting in performance degradation. To address this issue, a novel extrapolation-based framework is proposed that enhances environmental diversity by augmenting the IRM penalty through synthetic distributional shifts. Extensive experiments -- ranging from synthetic setups to realistic, over-parameterized scenarios -- demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

Summary:<br />
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have limitations like expressiveness constraints and over-smoothing due to message-passing methods. In this study, a new approach called Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM) is proposed, utilizing Transformer pre-training for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances as sequences of substructures and employs generative pre-training to learn transferable representations. It outperforms prior approaches in scalability, improving with model sizes up to 60M parameters on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. Systematic analysis of the model design space identifies key architectural choices contributing to scalability and generalization. G$^2$PM consistently surpasses strong baselines across tasks like node classification, graph classification, and transfer learning, showcasing its potential as a scalable graph learning framework. <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning.

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL) for dynamic and decentralized multimodal learning in IoT ecosystems. It addresses the challenges posed by the vast amount of data generated by IoT devices and the need for distributed learning strategies. The real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage on edge devices call for an online learning paradigm, which MMO-FL aims to fulfill. The framework takes into account the instability of edge devices and proposes the Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm to compensate for missing modalities during the learning process. The article includes a theoretical analysis of complete and missing modality scenarios, highlighting the performance degradation caused by missing modalities. Experimental results on multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of PMM compared to benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment. Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios, providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM compared to benchmarks.

Summary:
NAN presents a training-free method for model merging by optimizing coefficients through least-squares optimization. The approach is based on the idea that optimal merging weights should be proportional to the task-specific information contained in each model. NAN calculates merging coefficients using the inverse of parameter norm, making it a versatile and straightforward solution for combining independently fine-tuned models. The method shows consistent performance improvements over existing baseline methods in various experiments. NAN offers scalability and generality in model merging strategies, providing a plug-and-play option for enhancing model performance without the need for additional training data. <div>

Abstract: Model merging offers a training-free alternative to multi-task learning by combining independently fine-tuned models into a unified one without access to raw data. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics to determine the merging coefficients, limiting their scalability and generality. In this work, we revisit model merging through the lens of least-squares optimization and show that the optimal merging weights should scale with the amount of task-specific information encoded in each model. Based on this insight, we propose NAN, a simple yet effective method that estimates model merging coefficients via the inverse of parameter norm. NAN is training-free, plug-and-play, and applicable to a wide range of merging strategies. Extensive experiments on show that NAN consistently improves performance of baseline methods.

Summary:<br />
- Models trained with noisy data can still make accurate predictions despite erroneous labels, prompting the investigation into why this is possible.
- Analysis reveals that label inaccuracy mainly affects lower components of weight matrices and subtly perturbs the principal subspace, but within a certain range preserves task-relevant information.
- Formal proof shows that principal subspaces of weights trained on inaccurate labels exhibit minimal deviation, explaining the models' ability to generalize effectively.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from inaccurate annotations has gained significant attention due to the high cost of precise labeling. However, despite the presence of erroneous labels, models trained on noisy data often retain the ability to make accurate predictions. This intriguing phenomenon raises a fundamental yet largely unexplored question: why models can still extract correct label information from inaccurate annotations remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into this issue. By analyzing weight matrices from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, we find that label inaccuracy primarily accumulates noise in lower singular components and subtly perturbs the principal subspace. Within a certain range, the principal subspaces of weights trained on inaccurate labels remain largely aligned with those learned from clean labels, preserving essential task-relevant information. We formally prove that the angles of principal subspaces exhibit minimal deviation under moderate label inaccuracy, explaining why models can still generalize effectively. Building on these insights, we propose LIP, a lightweight plug-in designed to help classifiers retain principal subspace information while mitigating noise induced by label inaccuracy. Extensive experiments on tasks with various inaccuracy conditions demonstrate that LIP consistently enhances the performance of existing algorithms. We hope our findings can offer valuable theoretical and practical insights to understand of model robustness under inaccurate supervision.

Summary:
This paper introduces a robust reputation mechanism for federated healthcare to address challenges such as data heterogeneity and unreliable contributions. The proposed approach integrates decentralized peer feedback and clustering-based noise handling to enhance model aggregation. Differential privacy is applied to client-side model updates to protect sensitive information during reputation computation. The framework utilizes the Cox Proportional Hazards model for survival analysis across multiple federated nodes and dynamically adjusts trust scores based on local performance improvements measured via the concordance index. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the method consistently achieves high and stable C-index values, effectively down-weighing noisy client updates and outperforming FL methods without a reputation system. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds great promise for digital health by enabling collaborative model training without compromising patient data privacy. However, heterogeneity across institutions, lack of sustained reputation, and unreliable contributions remain major challenges. In this paper, we propose a robust, peer-driven reputation mechanism for federated healthcare that employs a hybrid communication model to integrate decentralized peer feedback with clustering-based noise handling to enhance model aggregation. Crucially, our approach decouples the federated aggregation and reputation mechanisms by applying differential privacy to client-side model updates before sharing them for peer evaluation. This ensures sensitive information remains protected during reputation computation, while unaltered updates are sent to the server for global model training. Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model for survival analysis across multiple federated nodes, our framework addresses both data heterogeneity and reputation deficit by dynamically adjusting trust scores based on local performance improvements measured via the concordance index. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic datasets and the SEER dataset demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high and stable C-index values, effectively down-weighing noisy client updates and outperforming FL methods that lack a reputation system.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors establish directional convergence of network parameters in fixed-width leaky ReLU two-layer neural networks optimized via gradient descent with exponential loss. This result, previously only known for gradient flow, is proven under conditions of benign overfitting, revealing a new phase transition in the test error bound. Importantly, these findings extend beyond the traditional nearly orthogonal data setting.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove directional convergence of network parameters of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural networks optimized by gradient descent with exponential loss, which was previously only known for gradient flow. By a careful analysis of the convergent direction, we establish sufficient conditions of benign overfitting and discover a new phase transition in the test error bound. All of these results hold beyond the nearly orthogonal data setting which was studied in prior works. As an application, we demonstrate that benign overfitting occurs with high probability in sub-Gaussian mixture models.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference. To address this issue, the NQKV algorithm is introduced, which employs per-block quantile quantization based on the element distribution of the KV cache. This approach allows for optimal quantization error and enables LLMs to perform inference with larger batch sizes or longer context lengths without compromising model output quality. By implementing NQKV, the OPT model demonstrates improved throughput by 9.3x compared to traditional methods, showcasing the effectiveness of the algorithm in enhancing the efficiency of LLM deployment. <div>
arXiv:2505.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs often require larger batch sizes to enhance throughput or longer context lengths to meet task demands, which significantly increases the memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference, becoming a major bottleneck in LLM deployment. To address this issue, quantization is a common and straightforward approach. Currently, quantization methods for activations are limited to 8-bit, and quantization to even lower bits can lead to substantial accuracy drops. To further save space by quantizing the KV cache to even lower bits, we analyzed the element distribution of the KV cache and designed the NQKV algorithm. Since the elements within each block of the KV cache follow a normal distribution, NQKV employs per-block quantile quantization to achieve information-theoretically optimal quantization error. Without significantly compromising model output quality, NQKV enables the OPT model to perform inference with an 2x larger batch size or a 4x longer context length, and it improves throughput by 9.3x compared to when the KV cache is not used.

<div> Successor representation, reinforcement learning, credit assignment, exploration, reward dynamics <br />
<br />Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the default representation (DR) as a new approach in reinforcement learning, building upon the successor representation (SR) concept. The DR considers both transition dynamics and reward dynamics of the environment, unlike the SR. The theoretical foundation of DR is established through dynamic programming and temporal-difference methods. The vector space and extension to function approximation with default features are characterized. Empirical analysis demonstrates the benefits of DR in various scenarios such as reward shaping, option discovery, exploration, and transfer learning. Compared to SR, DR shows qualitatively different, reward-aware behavior and achieves quantitatively better performance in multiple settings. <div>
arXiv:2505.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the successor representation (SR) has attracted increasing attention in reinforcement learning (RL), and it has been used to address some of its key challenges, such as exploration, credit assignment, and generalization. The SR can be seen as representing the underlying credit assignment structure of the environment by implicitly encoding its induced transition dynamics. However, the SR is reward-agnostic. In this paper, we discuss a similar representation that also takes into account the reward dynamics of the problem. We study the default representation (DR), a recently proposed representation with limited theoretical (and empirical) analysis. Here, we lay some of the theoretical foundation underlying the DR in the tabular case by (1) deriving dynamic programming and (2) temporal-difference methods to learn the DR, (3) characterizing the basis for the vector space of the DR, and (4) formally extending the DR to the function approximation case through default features. Empirically, we analyze the benefits of the DR in many of the settings in which the SR has been applied, including (1) reward shaping, (2) option discovery, (3) exploration, and (4) transfer learning. Our results show that, compared to the SR, the DR gives rise to qualitatively different, reward-aware behaviour and quantitatively better performance in several settings.

Summary: 
Tabular data is commonly found in various domains and has been predominantly analyzed using tree-based models. The TabPFN v2 deep learning model has shown superior performance but its adaptability in open environments is questioned. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted on TabPFN v2 to assess its performance under various real-world challenges. Results indicate that while TabPFN v2 is suitable for small-scale, covariate-shifted, and class-balanced tasks, it exhibits limitations in open environments. Tree-based models remain a better choice for general tabular tasks in open environments. Suggestions are made for the development of open environment tabular benchmarks, multi-metric evaluation, and universal modules to enhance model robustness. The evaluation framework for TabPFN v2 in open environments is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Tabular data, owing to its ubiquitous presence in real-world domains, has garnered significant attention in machine learning research. While tree-based models have long dominated tabular machine learning tasks, the recently proposed deep learning model TabPFN v2 has emerged, demonstrating unparalleled performance and scalability potential. Although extensive research has been conducted on TabPFN v2 to further improve performance, the majority of this research remains confined to closed environments, neglecting the challenges that frequently arise in open environments. This raises the question: Can TabPFN v2 maintain good performance in open environments? To this end, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of TabPFN v2's adaptability in open environments. We construct a unified evaluation framework covering various real-world challenges and assess the robustness of TabPFN v2 under open environments scenarios using this framework. Empirical results demonstrate that TabPFN v2 shows significant limitations in open environments but is suitable for small-scale, covariate-shifted, and class-balanced tasks. Tree-based models remain the optimal choice for general tabular tasks in open environments. To facilitate future research on open environments challenges, we advocate for open environments tabular benchmarks, multi-metric evaluation, and universal modules to strengthen model robustness. We publicly release our evaluation framework at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tabpfn-ood-4E65.

<div> Keywords: offline reinforcement learning, healthcare, out-of-distribution issues, safe policy exploration, safety constraints

Summary:<br />
Offline reinforcement learning in healthcare faces challenges with out-of-distribution issues, which can lead to harmful recommendations. Current methods like conservative Q-learning only constrain action selection, limiting the discovery of improved treatment strategies. To address these limitations, Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning (OGSRL) is proposed. OGSRL uses a dual constraint mechanism to improve policy with reliability and safety. The OOD guardian specifies safe policy exploration regions, allowing for reliable exploration of treatment strategies beyond clinician recommendations. Safety cost constraints encode medical knowledge to ensure domain-specific safeguards. Theoretical guarantees are provided on safety and near-optimality, ensuring policies stay within safe and reliable regions while achieving close to optimal performance supported by data. 

Summary:  <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios, the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL) attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories, thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety. First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions, it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.

<br />
Small- and large-scale language model predictions show high correlation across different training data distributions. This correlation allows for understanding how choices in training data influence model behavior across compute scales. By examining the impact of proxy scale on two downstream applications — data attribution and dataset selection — researchers can determine the effectiveness of using scaled-down proxy models. This research provides insight into the intricate relationship between training data and model behavior, shedding light on how different data distributions can impact model predictions. The findings suggest that extrapolating from smaller proxy models may not always accurately represent the behavior of larger models, highlighting the complexity of training data influence on model performance.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choice of training data distribution greatly influences model behavior. Yet, in large-scale settings, precisely characterizing how changes in training data affects predictions is often difficult due to model training costs. Current practice is to instead extrapolate from scaled down, inexpensive-to-train proxy models. However, changes in data do not influence smaller and larger models identically. Therefore, understanding how choice of data affects large-scale models raises the question: how does training data distribution influence model behavior across compute scale? We find that small- and large-scale language model predictions (generally) do highly correlate across choice of training data. Equipped with these findings, we characterize how proxy scale affects effectiveness in two downstream proxy model applications: data attribution and dataset selection.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new training framework called Think-RM for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Think-RM enables long-horizon reasoning in generative reward models by modeling an internal thinking process. The framework generates flexible reasoning traces supporting advanced reasoning abilities. The models are trained using supervised fine-tuning over long chain-of-thought (CoT) data and further improved with rule-based reinforcement learning. A novel pairwise RLHF pipeline is proposed, optimizing policies using pairwise preference rewards for more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experimental results on RM-Bench show that Think-RM outperforms conventional reward models and vertically scaled generative models by 8%. When combined with the pairwise RLHF pipeline, Think-RM demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional approaches. <div>
arXiv:2505.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful post-training paradigm for aligning large language models with human preferences. A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals, where the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from sensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward hacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward. However, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting their capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks. Moreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF algorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce Think-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by modeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured, externally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection, hypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning abilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over long CoT data. We then further improve the model's long-horizon abilities by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). In addition, we propose a novel pairwise RLHF pipeline that directly optimizes policies using pairwise preference rewards, eliminating the need for pointwise reward conversion and enabling more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experiments show that Think-RM achieves state-of-the-art results on RM-Bench, outperforming both BT RM and vertically scaled GenRM by 8%. When combined with our pairwise RLHF pipeline, it demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional approaches.

<div> Keywords: attention mechanisms, large language models, quadratic time, layer collapse, representational strength <br />
Summary: 
This paper discusses the necessity of large weights in preventing layer collapse in expressive transformers with attention mechanisms. Previous research had shown that small weights lead to rank collapse, necessitating skip connections in networks for expressiveness. However, this paper reveals that even with skip connections, layer collapse still occurs without large weights. The concept of layer collapse signifies that the network can be effectively approximated by a single layer, highlighting the importance of weight size in maintaining representational strength. Thus, the study emphasizes that large weights, rather than skip connections, are crucial in avoiding such weaknesses in attention-based models. <div>
arXiv:2505.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms lie at the heart of modern large language models (LLMs). Straightforward algorithms for forward and backward (gradient) computation take quadratic time, and a line of work initiated by [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2023] and [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2024] has shown that quadratic time is necessary unless the model weights are small, in which case almost linear time algorithms are possible. In this paper, we show that large weights are necessary to avoid a strong preclusion to representational strength we call layer collapse, which means that the entire network can be approximated well by a network with only a single layer. Thus, the quadratic running time of attention is unavoidable for expressive transformers.
  The notion of layer collapse that we introduce is a variant on the notion of rank collapse from the work of [Dong, Cordonnier, and Loukas ICML 2021]. They showed that in Self Attention Networks with small weights and with skip connections, rank collapse must occur. This is typically interpreted as justifying the necessity of skip connections in expressive networks. However, our result shows that even with skip connections, if the weights are small, then layer collapse still occurs. Thus, only large weights, and not skip connections, can prevent these representational weaknesses.

Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the impact of adopting fair classifiers on ecosystem fairness, focusing on fairness in systems with competing firms. It reveals that fair classifiers may not necessarily result in fair ecosystems due to factors such as classifiers' correlation and data overlap. The study emphasizes that even if individual classifiers are fair, the overall ecosystem outcome may be unfair. Adjusting biased algorithms to improve individual fairness could lead to a decline in ecosystem fairness. Theoretical analyses and experimental evidence are provided to support these findings. The research highlights the importance of considering ecosystem fairness alongside individual fairness when designing and implementing ML algorithms. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a central issue in ML, and it has become standard practice to adjust ML algorithms so that they will satisfy fairness requirements such as Equal Opportunity. In this paper we consider the effects of adopting such fair classifiers on the overall level of ecosystem fairness. Specifically, we introduce the study of fairness with competing firms, and demonstrate the failure of fair classifiers in yielding fair ecosystems. Our results quantify the loss of fairness in systems, under a variety of conditions, based on classifiers' correlation and the level of their data overlap. We show that even if competing classifiers are individually fair, the ecosystem's outcome may be unfair; and that adjusting biased algorithms to improve their individual fairness may lead to an overall decline in ecosystem fairness. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide supporting experimental evidence. Together, our model and results provide a novel and essential call for action.

Summary:
The article introduces a scalable Bayesian algorithm, CP-GAMP, for Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD). The algorithm utilizes generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid high-dimensional matrix inversions, resulting in significant runtime reduction for large tensors. By incorporating an expectation-maximization routine, CP-GAMP can jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Experimental results on synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with 20% observed elements demonstrate an 82.7% decrease in runtime compared to the existing variational Bayesian CPD method while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy. This advancement in Bayesian CPD algorithms offers principled uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning for tensor reconstruction, with the ability to handle large-scale tensors efficiently. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy.

<div> causal inference, multivariate time series forecasting, Structural Causal Model, Causal Informed Transformer, spurious correlation <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new approach for multivariate time series forecasting that focuses on identifying variable-specific causal influences. It proposes an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable separately based on a Structural Causal Model. The model partitions historical sequences into endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious correlation sub-segments and uses only the causally relevant segments for prediction. The proposed Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer) consists of three prediction blocks for processing the different sub-segments. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the CAIFormer in improving forecasting accuracy by distinguishing between causally relevant information and spurious correlations. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles. However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the historical sequence into four sub-segments according to the inferred causal structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious correlation. The prediction relies solely on the first three causally relevant sub-segments, while the spurious correlation sub-segment is excluded. Furthermore, we propose Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer), a novel forecasting model comprising three components: Endogenous Sub-segment Prediction Block, Direct Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, and Collider Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, which process the endogenous, direct causal, and collider causal sub-segments, respectively. Their outputs are then combined to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAIFormer.

Summary:  
Accurate demand estimation in retail is crucial for inventory and pricing strategies, but is hindered by censored sales data during stockouts. The article introduces FreshRetailNet-50K, a large-scale benchmark dataset with 50,000 store-product time series containing detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores across 18 cities. This dataset is annotated for stockout events and includes hourly stock status records, contextual covariates, and rich data features. A two-stage demand modeling approach is demonstrated using precise annotations to reconstruct latent demand during stockouts and enhance demand forecasting accuracy. The dataset enables innovative research in demand imputation, perishable inventory optimization, and causal retail analytics. The open release of the dataset and code addresses retail AI limitations and facilitates future methodological advancements.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate demand estimation is critical for the retail business in guiding the inventory and pricing policies of perishable products. However, it faces fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing 863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73\% improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand underestimation from 7.37\% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code (https://github.com/Dingdong-Inc/frn-50k-baseline}) are openly released.

Summary:
AdaSTaR is introduced as a novel algorithm that addresses the issue of observation imbalance during the training of self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs) by combining two adaptive sampling principles. Adaptive Sampling for Diversity ensures a balanced training across different observations, while Adaptive Sampling for Curriculum dynamically adjusts the data difficulty to match the model's strength. AdaSTaR outperforms existing baselines across six benchmarks, achieving the best test accuracy in all instances and reducing training FLOPs by an average of 58.6%. These results generalize to various pre-trained LMs and larger models, leading to more efficient and effective self-improving LMs. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

Summary:
- The Differential Transformer architecture has gained attention for its noise-canceling abilities and empirical performance.
- The success of the model is attributed to (1) enhanced expressivity through negative attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved learning dynamics.
- The proposed DEX method efficiently integrates these advantages into pretrained language models by reusing softmax attention scores and applying a lightweight differential operation.
- DEX significantly improves pretrained Language Models (LLMs) across various benchmarks with minimal adaptation data required.
- Through DEX, the benefits of differential attention can be effectively incorporated into existing pretrained LLMs, enhancing performance while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover, Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01\%).

Summary: 
CLEANMOL is a novel framework designed to improve the ability of large language models (LLMs) to understand molecular structures encoded in the SMILES representation. By breaking down SMILES parsing into clean and deterministic tasks focused on graph-level molecular comprehension, CLEANMOL provides structured supervision aligned with molecular structural properties. This framework includes tasks such as subgraph matching and global graph matching to enhance structural comprehension. The researchers constructed a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive difficulty scoring and pre-trained open-source LLMs on these tasks. The results demonstrate that CLEANMOL not only improves structural comprehension but also performs competitively or surpasses baseline models on the Mol-Instructions benchmark. Overall, CLEANMOL addresses the limitations of current LLMs in interpreting molecular structures, offering a promising advancement in the field of molecular science. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL, a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.

<br />Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of long-tailed semi-supervised learning with distribution mismatch by proposing a dynamic expert assignment module that assigns suitable experts to samples based on their estimated class membership. By integrating the strengths of different experts, the method produces high-quality pseudo-labels during training and accurate predictions during testing. The theoretical analysis shows that combining experts results in a smaller generalization error. Additionally, a multi-depth feature fusion module is introduced to mitigate model bias by utilizing features at different depths. Experimental results on datasets such as CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT, and SVHN-LT demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available for further exploration. <div>
arXiv:2505.16341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers (experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval. Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We, therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT, and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. The code is available at https://github.com/yaxinhou/Meta-Expert.

In this paper, a versatile scheme for optimizing arrival rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems is introduced. The authors redefine quasi-reversibility to include reversibility and emphasize the significance of customer classes. They propose balanced arrival control policies, extending the concept of balanced arrival rates to various quasi-reversible queueing systems. Demonstrating that integrating a balanced arrival-control policy maintains quasi-reversibility, the stationary measures are specified. The study revisits Whittle networks and order-independent queues as examples of quasi-reversible queueing systems. Finally, the article addresses admission control and applies the findings to optimization and reinforcement learning. This work contributes to enhancing the performance of queueing systems through strategic arrival control policies. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We first propose an alternative definition of quasi-reversibility that encompasses reversibility and highlights the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that supplementing a quasi-reversible queueing system with a balanced arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.

<div> Keywords: AdamS, large language model, optimization performance, transformer objectives, theoretical guarantees

Summary:
AdamS is introduced as an efficient alternative optimizer for large language model (LLM) pretraining and post-training. It eliminates the need for second-moment estimates by using a novel denominator based on the momentum and current gradient. With comparable memory and compute footprint to SGD with momentum, AdamS offers superior optimization performance. It can inherit hyperparameters from AdamW and seamlessly integrate into existing pipelines without modifications. The motivation for AdamS comes from $(L_0, L_1)$ smoothness properties observed in transformer objectives. The optimizer is model-agnostic and provides rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees along with practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection. Empirical results show strong performance in pre-training runs on GPT-2 and Llama2, as well as reinforcement learning in post-training regimes. AdamS is positioned as a compelling optimizer choice due to its efficiency, simplicity, and solid theoretical foundation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AdamS, a simple yet effective alternative to Adam for large language model (LLM) pretraining and post-training. By leveraging a novel denominator, i.e., the root of weighted sum of squares of the momentum and the current gradient, AdamS eliminates the need for second-moment estimates. Hence, AdamS is efficient, matching the memory and compute footprint of SGD with momentum while delivering superior optimization performance. Moreover, AdamS is easy to adopt: it can directly inherit hyperparameters of AdamW, and is entirely model-agnostic, integrating seamlessly into existing pipelines without modifications to optimizer APIs or architectures. The motivation behind AdamS stems from the observed $(L_0, L_1)$ smoothness properties in transformer objectives, where local smoothness is governed by gradient magnitudes that can be further approximated by momentum magnitudes. We establish rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees and provide practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection. Empirically, AdamS demonstrates strong performance in various tasks, including pre-training runs on GPT-2 and Llama2 (up to 13B parameters) and reinforcement learning in post-training regimes. With its efficiency, simplicity, and theoretical grounding, AdamS stands as a compelling alternative to existing optimizers.

Abstract: Developing new molecular compounds is crucial to address pressing challenges, from health to environmental sustainability. However, exploring the molecular space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space. Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters. Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.

Abstract: How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.
  To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.
  We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large-scale language models has amplified concerns regarding their interpretability and reusability. While traditional embedding models like Word2Vec and GloVe offer scalability, they lack transparency and often behave as black boxes. Conversely, interpretable models such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) have shown promise in constructing explainable learning systems, though they previously faced limitations in scalability and reusability. In this paper, we introduce Omni Tsetlin Machine AutoEncoder (Omni TM-AE), a novel embedding model that fully exploits the information contained in the TM's state matrix, including literals previously excluded from clause formation. This method enables the construction of reusable, interpretable embeddings through a single training phase. Extensive experiments across semantic similarity, sentiment classification, and document clustering tasks show that Omni TM-AE performs competitively with and often surpasses mainstream embedding models. These results demonstrate that it is possible to balance performance, scalability, and interpretability in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems without resorting to opaque architectures.

<title>AceReason-Nemotron: Advancing Math and Code Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

<title>Divide-Fuse-Conquer: Eliciting "Aha Moments" in Multi-Scenario Games</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics, coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games. The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the generalization of LLMs.

<title>Performance Guaranteed Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning: A Sliding Mode Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16403</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS) issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by 10\%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state, achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning rates.

<title>Implicit Jailbreak Attacks via Cross-Modal Information Concealment on Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16446</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable powerful cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the expanded input space introduces new attack surfaces. Previous jailbreak attacks often inject malicious instructions from text into less aligned modalities, such as vision. As MLLMs increasingly incorporate cross-modal consistency and alignment mechanisms, such explicit attacks become easier to detect and block. In this work, we propose a novel implicit jailbreak framework termed IJA that stealthily embeds malicious instructions into images via least significant bit steganography and couples them with seemingly benign, image-related textual prompts. To further enhance attack effectiveness across diverse MLLMs, we incorporate adversarial suffixes generated by a surrogate model and introduce a template optimization module that iteratively refines both the prompt and embedding based on model feedback. On commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, our method achieves attack success rates of over 90% using an average of only 3 queries.

<title>Neighbour-Driven Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders for Scalable Structured Latent Modelling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16481</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16481</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.

<title>Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Guided Topic Modeling of Minority Topics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16493</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic models often fail to capture low-prevalence, domain-critical themes, so-called minority topics, such as mental health themes in online comments. While some existing methods can incorporate domain knowledge, such as expected topical content, methods allowing guidance may require overly detailed expected topics, hindering the discovery of topic divisions and variation. We propose a topic modeling solution via a specially constrained NMF. We incorporate a seed word list characterizing minority content of interest, but we do not require experts to pre-specify their division across minority topics. Through prevalence constraints on minority topics and seed word content across topics, we learn distinct data-driven minority topics as well as majority topics. The constrained NMF is fitted via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with multiplicative updates. We outperform several baselines on synthetic data in terms of topic purity, normalized mutual information, and also evaluate topic quality using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD). We conduct a case study on YouTube vlog comments, analyzing viewer discussion of mental health content; our model successfully identifies and reveals this domain-relevant minority content.

<title>Accuracy vs. Accuracy: Computational Tradeoffs Between Classification Rates and Utility</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16494</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16494</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the foundations of fairness and its interplay with utility and efficiency in settings where the training data contain richer labels, such as individual types, rankings, or risk estimates, rather than just binary outcomes. In this context, we propose algorithms that achieve stronger notions of evidence-based fairness than are possible in standard supervised learning. Our methods support classification and ranking techniques that preserve accurate subpopulation classification rates, as suggested by the underlying data distributions, across a broad class of classification rules and downstream applications. Furthermore, our predictors enable loss minimization, whether aimed at maximizing utility or in the service of fair treatment.
  Complementing our algorithmic contributions, we present impossibility results demonstrating that simultaneously achieving accurate classification rates and optimal loss minimization is, in some cases, computationally infeasible. Unlike prior impossibility results, our notions are not inherently in conflict and are simultaneously satisfied by the Bayes-optimal predictor. Furthermore, we show that each notion can be satisfied individually via efficient learning. Our separation thus stems from the computational hardness of learning a sufficiently good approximation of the Bayes-optimal predictor. These computational impossibilities present a choice between two natural and attainable notions of accuracy that could both be motivated by fairness.

<title>Computing Exact Shapley Values in Polynomial Time for Product-Kernel Methods</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel methods are widely used in machine learning due to their flexibility and expressive power. However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to interpretability, limiting their adoption in high-stakes applications. Shapley value-based feature attribution techniques, such as SHAP and kernel-specific variants like RKHS-SHAP, offer a promising path toward explainability. Yet, computing exact Shapley values remains computationally intractable in general, motivating the development of various approximation schemes. In this work, we introduce PKeX-Shapley, a novel algorithm that utilizes the multiplicative structure of product kernels to enable the exact computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. We show that product-kernel models admit a functional decomposition that allows for a recursive formulation of Shapley values. This decomposition not only yields computational efficiency but also enhances interpretability in kernel-based learning. We also demonstrate how our framework can be generalized to explain kernel-based statistical discrepancies such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), thus offering new tools for interpretable statistical inference.

<title>Joint Relational Database Generation via Graph-Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets. However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.

arXiv:2505.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptation of foundation models using low-rank methods is a widespread approach. Another way to adapt these models is to employ orthogonal fine-tuning methods, which are less time and memory efficient despite their good generalization properties. In this work, we propose Householder Orthogonal Fine-tuning (HOFT), a novel orthogonal fine-tuning method that aims to alleviate time and space complexity. Moreover, some theoretical properties of the orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm are explored. From this exploration, Scaled Householder Orthogonal Fine-tuning (SHOFT) is proposed. Both HOFT and SHOFT are evaluated in downstream tasks, namely commonsense reasoning, machine translation, subject-driven generation and mathematical reasoning. Compared with state-of-the-art adaptation methods, HOFT and SHOFT show comparable or better results.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of incremental sequence classification, where predictions are updated as new elements in the sequence are revealed. Drawing on temporal-difference learning from reinforcement learning, we identify a temporal-consistency condition that successive predictions should satisfy. We leverage this condition to develop a novel loss function for training incremental sequence classifiers. Through a concrete example, we demonstrate that optimizing this loss can offer substantial gains in data efficiency. We apply our method to text classification tasks and show that it improves predictive accuracy over competing approaches on several benchmark datasets. We further evaluate our approach on the task of verifying large language model generations for correctness in grade-school math problems. Our results show that models trained with our method are better able to distinguish promising generations from unpromising ones after observing only a few tokens.

<title>Towards Coordinate- and Dimension-Agnostic Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in. This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate- and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call ``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

<title>A Two-Stage Data Selection Framework for Data-Efficient Model Training on Edge Devices</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for machine learning (ML) model training on edge devices is escalating due to data privacy and personalized service needs. However, we observe that current on-device model training is hampered by the under-utilization of on-device data, due to low training throughput, limited storage and diverse data importance. To improve data resource utilization, we propose a two-stage data selection framework {\sf Titan} to select the most important data batch from streaming data for model training with guaranteed efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in the first stage, {\sf Titan} filters out a candidate dataset with potentially high importance in a coarse-grained manner.In the second stage of fine-grained selection, we propose a theoretically optimal data selection strategy to identify the data batch with the highest model performance improvement to current training round. To further enhance time-and-resource efficiency, {\sf Titan} leverages a pipeline to co-execute data selection and model training, and avoids resource conflicts by exploiting idle computing resources. We evaluate {\sf Titan} on real-world edge devices and three representative edge computing tasks with diverse models and data modalities. Empirical results demonstrate that {\sf Titan} achieves up to $43\%$ reduction in training time and $6.2\%$ increase in final accuracy with minor system overhead, such as data processing delay, memory footprint and energy consumption.

<title>Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finetuning openly accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) has become standard practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now, finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which training on benign datasets led to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that an adversary can create poisoned LLMs that initially appear benign but exhibit malicious behaviors once finetuned by downstream users. To this end, our proposed attack, FAB (Finetuning-Activated Backdoor), poisons an LLM via meta-learning techniques to simulate downstream finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of malicious behaviors in the finetuned models. At the same time, the poisoned LLM is regularized to retain general capabilities and to exhibit no malicious behaviors prior to finetuning. As a result, when users finetune the seemingly benign model on their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its hidden backdoor behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three target behaviors: unsolicited advertising, refusal, and jailbreakability. Additionally, we show that FAB-backdoors are robust to various finetuning choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler). Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the security of finetuning, revealing yet another critical attack vector exploiting the complexities of LLMs.

arXiv:2505.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting more important than ever. An increasing number of advanced load forecasting methods have been developed. However, the static design of current methods offers no mechanism for human-model interaction. As the primary users of forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial intelligence (AI). This also prevents them from incorporating their experience and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process. Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to address this issue. By leveraging their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. A set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism. This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling the integration of human experience. Our experiments demonstrate that the interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users provide proper insight in key stages. Our cost analysis shows that the framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.

<title>How Ensembles of Distilled Policies Improve Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer setting in reinforcement learning, the goal is to train an agent on a fixed set of training environments so that it can generalise to similar, but unseen, testing environments. Previous work has shown that policy distillation after training can sometimes produce a policy that outperforms the original in the testing environments. However, it is not yet entirely clear why that is, or what data should be used to distil the policy. In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation bound for policy distillation after training. The theory provides two practical insights: for improved generalisation, you should 1) train an ensemble of distilled policies, and 2) distil it on as much data from the training environments as possible. We empirically verify that these insights hold in more general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer hold. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of policies distilled on a diverse dataset can generalise significantly better than the original agent.

Abstract: Plausible counterfactual explanations (p-CFEs) are perturbations that minimally modify inputs to change classifier decisions while remaining plausible under the data distribution. In this study, we demonstrate that classifiers can be trained on p-CFEs labeled with induced \emph{incorrect} target classes to classify unperturbed inputs with the original labels. While previous studies have shown that such learning is possible with adversarial perturbations, we extend this paradigm to p-CFEs. Interestingly, our experiments reveal that learning from p-CFEs is even more effective: the resulting classifiers achieve not only high in-distribution accuracy but also exhibit significantly reduced bias with respect to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic, low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation on https://kausable.github.io/CausalDynamics.

Abstract: Reliably characterizing the full conditional distribution of a multivariate response variable given a set of covariates is crucial for trustworthy decision-making. However, misspecified or miscalibrated multivariate models may yield a poor approximation of the joint distribution of the response variables, leading to unreliable predictions and suboptimal decisions. Furthermore, standard recalibration methods are primarily limited to univariate settings, while conformal prediction techniques, despite generating multivariate prediction regions with coverage guarantees, do not provide a full probability density function. We address this gap by first introducing a novel notion of latent calibration, which assesses probabilistic calibration in the latent space of a conditional normalizing flow. Second, we propose latent recalibration (LR), a novel post-hoc model recalibration method that learns a transformation of the latent space with finite-sample bounds on latent calibration. Unlike existing methods, LR produces a recalibrated distribution with an explicit multivariate density function while remaining computationally efficient. Extensive experiments on both tabular and image datasets show that LR consistently improves latent calibration error and the negative log-likelihood of the recalibrated models.

<title>Reconsidering Fairness Through Unawareness from the Perspective of Model Multiplicity</title>

Abstract: Fairness through Unawareness (FtU) describes the idea that discrimination against demographic groups can be avoided by not considering group membership in the decisions or predictions. This idea has long been criticized in the machine learning literature as not being sufficient to ensure fairness. In addition, the use of additional features is typically thought to increase the accuracy of the predictions for all groups, so that FtU is sometimes thought to be detrimental to all groups. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that FtU can reduce algorithmic discrimination without necessarily reducing accuracy. We connect this insight with the literature on Model Multiplicity, to which we contribute with novel theoretical and empirical results. Furthermore, we illustrate how, in a real-life application, FtU can contribute to the deployment of more equitable policies without losing efficacy. Our findings suggest that FtU is worth considering in practical applications, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and that the use of protected attributes such as gender in predictive models should be accompanied by a clear and well-founded justification.

<title>Stochastic Forward-Forward Learning through Representational Dimensionality Compression</title>

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function to guide learning. Existing goodness functions, inspired by energy-based learning (EBL), are typically defined as the sum of squared post-synaptic activations, neglecting the correlations between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for clamped inputs when noise is considered while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples. We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared outputs, which is equivalent to making predictions based on the energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

<title>End-to-End Framework for Predicting the Remaining Useful Life of Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16664</link>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for enabling timely maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, impacting the operational efficiency of electric applications that rely on them. This paper proposes a RUL prediction approach that leverages data from recent charge-discharge cycles to estimate the number of remaining usable cycles. The approach introduces both a novel signal processing pipeline and a deep learning prediction model. In the signal preprocessing pipeline, a derived capacity feature is computed based on current and capacity signals. Alongside original capacity, voltage and current, these features are denoised and enhanced using statistical metrics and a delta-based method to capture differences between the current and previous cycles. In the prediction model, the processed features are then fed into a hybrid deep learning architecture composed of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM), and Ordinary Differential Equation-based LSTM (ODE-LSTM) modules. This architecture is designed to capture both local signal characteristics and long-range temporal dependencies while modeling the continuous-time dynamics of battery degradation. The model is further evaluated using transfer learning across different learning strategies and target data partitioning scenarios. Results indicate that the model maintains robust performance, even when fine-tuned on limited target data. Experimental results on two publicly available large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline deep learning approach and machine learning techniques, achieving an RMSE of 101.59, highlighting its strong potential for real-world RUL prediction applications.

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data exhibits high dimensionality, noise, and intricate feature entanglement, presenting significant challenges for traditional clustering algorithms. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of three clustering approaches: (1) Classical K-Means Clustering, applied to pre-processed feature representations; (2) Hybrid Clustering, wherein classical features are enhanced with quantum random features extracted using randomly initialized quantum neural networks (QNNs); and (3) Fully Quantum Clustering, where a QNN is trained in a self-supervised manner leveraging a SwAV-based loss function to optimize the feature space for clustering directly. The proposed experimental framework systematically investigates the impact of quantum circuit depth and the number of learned prototypes, demonstrating that even shallow quantum circuits can effectively extract meaningful non-linear representations, significantly improving clustering performance.

<title>On the Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Self-Supervised Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of self-supervised learning (SSL). By analyzing the mini-batch construction during the SSL training phase, we first give one plausible explanation for SSL having OOD generalization. Then, from the perspective of data generation and causal inference, we analyze and conclude that SSL learns spurious correlations during the training process, which leads to a reduction in OOD generalization. To address this issue, we propose a post-intervention distribution (PID) grounded in the Structural Causal Model. PID offers a scenario where the spurious variable and label variable is mutually independent. Besides, we demonstrate that if each mini-batch during SSL training satisfies PID, the resulting SSL model can achieve optimal worst-case OOD performance. This motivates us to develop a batch sampling strategy that enforces PID constraints through the learning of a latent variable model. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the identifiability of the latent variable model and validate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling strategy. Experiments conducted on various downstream OOD tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling strategy.

arXiv:2505.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\ coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a distance thresholding parameter $\Gamma$. The model can also be trained fully self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to the human genome.

<title>Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16690</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

<title>An Analysis of Concept Bottleneck Models: Measuring, Understanding, and Mitigating the Impact of Noisy Annotations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss. To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable, we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the presence of noise.

<title>Training Long-Context LLMs Efficiently via Chunk-wise Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16710</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16710</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While long-context large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable document processing capabilities, their prohibitively high training costs often hinder customized applications. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textit{Sequential Chunk-wise Optimization} (SeCO), a memory-efficient training paradigm that partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation, ensuring that only one chunk's forward activations are stored in memory. Building on SeCO, we further introduce \textit{Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization} (SpaCO), which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become longer. Implemented as lightweight training wrappers, both SeCO and SpaCO offer substantial practical benefits. For example, when fine-tuning an 8B model with LoRA on a single RTX 3090 GPU, SeCO expands maximum sequence length from 1K to 16K tokens, while SpaCO demonstrates accelerated training speed -- achieving up to 3x faster than SeCO under the same experimental setup. These innovations provide new insights into optimizing long-context models, making them more accessible for practical applications. We have open-sourced the code at \href{https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/seco}{here}.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models have shown great promise, driving progress in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare applications. However, despite their success, many existing pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content of neural oscillations, a limitation that fundamentally constrains their performance and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++ demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive results when compared to other open-source LBMs. Its superior performance and training efficiency highlight its potential as a strong foundation for future advancements in LBMs.

Abstract: Datasets in engineering domains are often small, sparsely labeled, and contain numerical as well as categorical conditions. Additionally. computational resources are typically limited in practical applications which hinders the adoption of generative models for engineering tasks. We introduce a novel masked-conditioning approach, that enables generative models to work with sparse, mixed-type data. We mask conditions during training to simulate sparse conditions at inference time. For this purpose, we explore the use of various sparsity schedules that show different strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we introduce a flexible embedding that deals with categorical as well as numerical conditions. We integrate our method into an efficient variational autoencoder as well as a latent diffusion model and demonstrate the applicability of our approach on two engineering-related datasets of 2D point clouds and images. Finally, we show that small models trained on limited data can be coupled with large pretrained foundation models to improve generation quality while retaining the controllability induced by our conditioning scheme.

arXiv:2505.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires agents to balance reducing uncertainty (exploration) against pursuing immediate objectives (exploitation). In this paper, we introduce a novel policy optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by anticipating future observations, without requiring extrinsic exploration bonuses or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo~(SMC) algorithm that efficiently estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing methods struggle to act under uncertainty.

arXiv:2505.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned (e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generative modelling.

Abstract: Simplicity is a powerful inductive bias. In reinforcement learning, regularization is used for simpler policies, data augmentation for simpler representations, and sparse reward functions for simpler objectives, all that, with the underlying motivation to increase generalizability and robustness by focusing on the essentials. Supplementary to these techniques, we investigate how to promote simple behavior throughout the episode. To that end, we introduce a modification of the reinforcement learning problem that additionally maximizes the total correlation within the induced trajectories. We propose a practical algorithm that optimizes all models, including policy and state representation, based on a lower-bound approximation. In simulated robot environments, our method naturally generates policies that induce periodic and compressible trajectories, and that exhibit superior robustness to noise and changes in dynamics compared to baseline methods, while also improving performance in the original tasks.

<title>Backward Oversmoothing: why is it hard to train deep Graph Neural Networks?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16736</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oversmoothing has long been identified as a major limitation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): input node features are smoothed at each layer and converge to a non-informative representation, if the weights of the GNN are sufficiently bounded. This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are sufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could thus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice, which prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view. In this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that backpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to oversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we outline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing. Moreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit many spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the whole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where gradients are near-zero while the loss stays high. The proof relies on the fact that, unlike forward oversmoothing, backward errors are subjected to a linear oversmoothing even in the presence of non-linear activation function, such that the average of the output error plays a key role. Additionally, we show that this phenomenon is specific to deep GNNs, and exhibit counter-example Multi-Layer Perceptron. This paper is a step toward a more complete comprehension of the optimization landscape specific to GNNs.

arXiv:2505.16737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to remarkable achievements across numerous applications. However, their ability to generate harmful content has sparked substantial safety concerns. Despite the implementation of safety alignment techniques during the pre-training phase, recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs on adversarial or even benign data can inadvertently compromise their safety. In this paper, we re-examine the fundamental issue of why fine-tuning on non-harmful data still results in safety degradation. We introduce a safety-aware probing (SAP) optimization framework designed to mitigate the safety risks of fine-tuning LLMs. Specifically, SAP incorporates a safety-aware probe into the gradient propagation process, mitigating the model's risk of safety degradation by identifying potential pitfalls in gradient directions, thereby enhancing task-specific performance while successfully preserving model safety. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAP effectively reduces harmfulness below the original fine-tuned model and achieves comparable test loss to standard fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChengcanWu/SAP.

Abstract: Minimum attention applies the least action principle in the changes of control concerning state and time, first proposed by Brockett. The involved regularization is highly relevant in emulating biological control, such as motor learning. We apply minimum attention in reinforcement learning (RL) as part of the rewards and investigate its connection to meta-learning and stabilization. Specifically, model-based meta-learning with minimum attention is explored in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics. Ensemble-based model learning and gradient-based meta-policy learning are alternately performed. Empirically, we show that the minimum attention does show outperforming competence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in model-free and model-based RL, i.e., fast adaptation in few shots and variance reduction from the perturbations of the model and environment. Furthermore, the minimum attention demonstrates the improvement in energy efficiency.

In this document, our primary focus will be on decisions related to pricing and quantity for the sale of airline tickets on a direct flight over a certain number of time periods. More specifically, we will only focus on the optimization aspect of this problem. We will assume the demand data to be given, since Air France estimates it beforehand using real data. Similarly, we assume all price options to be predetermined by Air France's algorithms and verified by their analysts. Our objective will be to maximize the revenue of a direct flight by choosing the prices for each product from the predefined set of options.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction as a powerful paradigm for learning control policies from pre-collected data, eliminating the need for costly or risky online interactions. While many open-source libraries offer robust implementations of offline RL algorithms, they all rely on datasets composed of experience tuples consisting of state, action, next state, and reward. Managing, curating, and distributing such datasets requires suitable infrastructure. Although static datasets exist for established benchmark problems, no standardized or scalable solution supports developing and sharing datasets for novel or user-defined benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce PyTupli, a Python-based tool to streamline the creation, storage, and dissemination of benchmark environments and their corresponding tuple datasets. PyTupli includes a lightweight client library with defined interfaces for uploading and retrieving benchmarks and data. It supports fine-grained filtering at both the episode and tuple level, allowing researchers to curate high-quality, task-specific datasets. A containerized server component enables production-ready deployment with authentication, access control, and automated certificate provisioning for secure use. By addressing key barriers in dataset infrastructure, PyTupli facilitates more collaborative, reproducible, and scalable offline RL research.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is a type of data to be obtained associated with a graph structure where vertices and edges describe some kind of data correlation. This paper proposes a regression method on graph-structured data, which is based on multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP), to capture both the correlation between vertices and the correlation between associated data. The proposed formulation is built on the definition of MOGP. This allows it to be applied to a wide range of data configurations and scenarios. Moreover, it has high expressive capability due to its flexibility in kernel design. It includes existing methods of Gaussian processes for graph-structured data as special cases and is possible to remove restrictions on data configurations, model selection, and inference scenarios in the existing methods. The performance of extensions achievable by the proposed formulation is evaluated through computer experiments with synthetic and real data.

At its core, FlowMixer incorporates non-negative matrix mixing layers within a reversible mapping framework-applying transforms before mixing and their inverses afterward. This shape-preserving design enables a Kronecker-Koopman eigenmode framework that bridges statistical learning with dynamical systems theory, providing interpretable spatiotemporal patterns and facilitating direct algebraic manipulation of prediction horizons without retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate FlowMixer's robust long-horizon forecasting capabilities while effectively modeling physical phenomena such as chaotic attractors and turbulent flows. These results suggest that architectural constraints can simultaneously enhance predictive performance and mathematical interpretability in neural forecasting systems.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions. However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored despite their importance in many real-world settings. We introduce Cohort-based Active Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark acquisition strategies. Experiments on common multimodal datasets demonstrate that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the acquisition of new samples in comparison to those relying solely on unimodal information, entropy guidance, and random selections. Our work provides an effective solution for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level, enabling better utilization of resources in constrained settings.

Abstract: Serious Games (SGs) are nowadays shifting focus to include procedural content generation (PCG) in the development process as a means of offering personalized and enhanced player experience. However, the development of a framework to assess the impact of PCG techniques when integrated into SGs remains particularly challenging. This study proposes a methodology for automated evaluation of PCG integration in SGs, incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) game testing agents. To validate the proposed framework, a previously introduced SG featuring card game mechanics and incorporating three different versions of PCG for nonplayer character (NPC) creation has been deployed. Version 1 features random NPC creation, while versions 2 and 3 utilize a genetic algorithm approach. These versions are used to test the impact of different dynamic SG environments on the proposed framework's agents. The obtained results highlight the superiority of the DRL game testing agents trained on Versions 2 and 3 over those trained on Version 1 in terms of win rate (i.e. number of wins per played games) and training time. More specifically, within the execution of a test emulating regular gameplay, both Versions 2 and 3 peaked at a 97% win rate and achieved statistically significant higher (p=0009) win rates compared to those achieved in Version 1 that peaked at 94%. Overall, results advocate towards the proposed framework's capability to produce meaningful data for the evaluation of procedurally generated content in SGs.

Abstract: Motivated by stochastic optimization, we introduce the problem of learning from samples of contextual value distributions. A contextual value distribution can be understood as a family of real-valued distributions, where each sample consists of a context $x$ and a random variable drawn from the corresponding real-valued distribution $D_x$. By minimizing a convex surrogate loss, we learn an empirical distribution $D'_x$ for each context, ensuring a small L\'evy distance to $D_x$. We apply this result to obtain the sample complexity bounds for the learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for stochastic optimization problems defined on an unknown contextual value distribution. The sample complexity is shown to be polynomial for the general case of strongly monotone and stable optimization problems, including Single-item Revenue Maximization, Pandora's Box and Optimal Stopping.

<title>Strategically Linked Decisions in Long-Term Planning and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Long-term planning, as in reinforcement learning (RL), involves finding strategies: actions that collectively work toward a goal rather than individually optimizing their immediate outcomes. As part of a strategy, some actions are taken at the expense of short-term benefit to enable future actions with even greater returns. These actions are only advantageous if followed up by the actions they facilitate, consequently, they would not have been taken if those follow-ups were not available. In this paper, we quantify such dependencies between planned actions with strategic link scores: the drop in the likelihood of one decision under the constraint that a follow-up decision is no longer available. We demonstrate the utility of strategic link scores through three practical applications: (i) explaining black-box RL agents by identifying strategically linked pairs among decisions they make, (ii) improving the worst-case performance of decision support systems by distinguishing whether recommended actions can be adopted as standalone improvements or whether they are strategically linked hence requiring a commitment to a broader strategy to be effective, and (iii) characterizing the planning processes of non-RL agents purely through interventions aimed at measuring strategic link scores - as an example, we consider a realistic traffic simulator and analyze through road closures the effective planning horizon of the emergent routing behavior of many drivers.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants. As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations, task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments and research in the FL literature.

<title>Efficient Online RL Fine Tuning with Offline Pre-trained Policy Only</title>

Abstract: Improving the performance of pre-trained policies through online reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical yet challenging topic. Existing online RL fine-tuning methods require continued training with offline pretrained Q-functions for stability and performance. However, these offline pretrained Q-functions commonly underestimate state-action pairs beyond the offline dataset due to the conservatism in most offline RL methods, which hinders further exploration when transitioning from the offline to the online setting. Additionally, this requirement limits their applicability in scenarios where only pre-trained policies are available but pre-trained Q-functions are absent, such as in imitation learning (IL) pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose a method for efficient online RL fine-tuning using solely the offline pre-trained policy, eliminating reliance on pre-trained Q-functions. We introduce PORL (Policy-Only Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning), which rapidly initializes the Q-function from scratch during the online phase to avoid detrimental pessimism. Our method not only achieves competitive performance with advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms and online RL approaches that leverage data or policies prior, but also pioneers a new path for directly fine-tuning behavior cloning (BC) policies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the System Identification (SYSID) problem within the framework of federated learning. We introduce a novel algorithm, Incremental Clustering-based federated learning method for SYSID (IC-SYSID), designed to tackle SYSID challenges across multiple data sources without prior knowledge. IC-SYSID utilizes an incremental clustering method, ClusterCraft (CC), to eliminate the dependency on the prior knowledge of the dataset. CC starts with a single cluster model and assigns similar local workers to the same clusters by dynamically increasing the number of clusters. To reduce the number of clusters generated by CC, we introduce ClusterMerge, where similar cluster models are merged. We also introduce enhanced ClusterCraft to reduce the generation of similar cluster models during the training. Moreover, IC-SYSID addresses cluster model instability by integrating a regularization term into the loss function and initializing cluster models with scaled Glorot initialization. It also utilizes a mini-batch deep learning approach to manage large SYSID datasets during local training. Through the experiments conducted on a real-world representing SYSID problem, where a fleet of vehicles collaboratively learns vehicle dynamics, we show that IC-SYSID achieves a high SYSID performance while preventing the learning of unstable clusters.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of graph domain adaptation on evolving, multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) graphs. Conventional graph domain adaptation methods are confined to single-step adaptation, making them ineffective in handling continuous domain shifts and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This paper introduces the Graph Continual Adaptive Learning (GCAL) method, designed to enhance model sustainability and adaptability across various graph domains. GCAL employs a bilevel optimization strategy. The "adapt" phase uses an information maximization approach to fine-tune the model with new graph domains while re-adapting past memories to mitigate forgetting. Concurrently, the "generate memory" phase, guided by a theoretical lower bound derived from information bottleneck theory, involves a variational memory graph generation module to condense original graphs into memories. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GCAL substantially outperforms existing methods in terms of adaptability and knowledge retention.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced critical security challenges, underscoring the need for accurate anomaly detection. Although numerous studies have proposed machine learning (ML) methods for this purpose, limited research systematically examines how different preprocessing steps--normalization, transformation, and feature selection--interact with distinct model architectures. To address this gap, this paper presents a multi-step evaluation framework assessing the combined impact of preprocessing choices on three ML algorithms: RNN-LSTM, autoencoder neural networks (ANN), and Gradient Boosting (GBoosting). Experiments on the IoTID20 dataset shows that GBoosting consistently delivers superior accuracy across preprocessing configurations, while RNN-LSTM shows notable gains with z-score normalization and autoencoders excel in recall, making them well-suited for unsupervised scenarios. By offering a structured analysis of preprocessing decisions and their interplay with various ML techniques, the proposed framework provides actionable guidance to enhance anomaly detection performance in IoT environments.

arXiv:2505.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases excel at various downstream tasks but lack the structural knowledge essential for many biological applications. To address this, we integrate structural insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter-protein and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks, including a 12.7% increase in ESM2 contact prediction. The data, code, and resulting SaESM2 and SaAMPLIFY models will be released on Hugging Face.

Abstract: Prompt tuning methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular to address the semantic gap between pre-training and fine-tuning steps. However, existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through pseudo-labeling. We use two regularization techniques to align the prompted graphs' distribution with the original data and reduce biased predictions. Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods that have access to labels.

arXiv:2505.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a concise review of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) methods and introduces an experimental framework for scalable, interpretable offer selection, addressing the challenge of fast-changing offers. The approach models context at the product category level, allowing offers to span multiple categories and enabling knowledge transfer across similar offers. This improves learning efficiency and generalization in dynamic environments. The framework extends standard CMAB methodology to support multi-category contexts, and achieves scalability through efficient feature engineering and modular design. Advanced features such as MPG (Member Purchase Gap) and MF (Matrix Factorization) capture nuanced user-offer interactions, with implementation in Python for practical deployment.
  A key contribution is interpretability at scale: logistic regression models yield transparent weight vectors, accessible via a large language model (LLM) interface for real-time, user-level tracking and explanation of evolving preferences. This enables the generation of detailed member profiles and identification of behavioral patterns, supporting personalized offer optimization and enhancing trust in automated decisions. By situating our prototype alongside established paradigms like Generalized Linear Models and Thompson Sampling, we demonstrate its value for both research and real-world CMAB applications.

Abstract: Risk-averse reinforcement learning finds application in various high-stakes fields. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize expected returns, risk-averse agents choose policies that minimize risk, occasionally sacrificing expected value. These preferences can be framed through utility theory. We focus on the specific case of the exponential utility function, where we can derive the Bellman equations and employ various reinforcement learning algorithms with few modifications. However, these methods suffer from numerical instability due to the need for exponent computation throughout the process. To address this, we introduce a numerically stable and mathematically sound loss function based on the Itakura-Saito divergence for learning state-value and action-value functions. We evaluate our proposed loss function against established alternatives, both theoretically and empirically. In the experimental section, we explore multiple financial scenarios, some with known analytical solutions, and show that our loss function outperforms the alternatives.

<title>The Polar Express: Optimal Matrix Sign Methods and Their Application to the Muon Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

arXiv:2505.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops the underpinnings of self-supervised placement-aware representation learning given spatially-distributed (multi-view and multimodal) sensor observations, motivated by the need to represent external environmental state in multi-sensor IoT systems in a manner that correctly distills spatial phenomena from the distributed multi-vantage observations. The objective of sensing in IoT systems is, in general, to collectively represent an externally observed environment given multiple vantage points from which sensory observations occur. Pretraining of models that help interpret sensor data must therefore encode the relation between signals observed by sensors and the observers' vantage points in order to attain a representation that encodes the observed spatial phenomena in a manner informed by the specific placement of the measuring instruments, while allowing arbitrary placement. The work significantly advances self-supervised model pretraining from IoT signals beyond current solutions that often overlook the distinctive spatial nature of IoT data. Our framework explicitly learns the dependencies between measurements and geometric observer layouts and structural characteristics, guided by a core design principle: the duality between signals and observer positions. We further provide theoretical analyses from the perspectives of information theory and occlusion-invariant representation learning to offer insight into the rationale behind our design. Experiments on three real-world datasets--covering vehicle monitoring, human activity recognition, and earthquake localization--demonstrate the superior generalizability and robustness of our method across diverse modalities, sensor placements, application-level inference tasks, and spatial scales.

Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks. This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare. However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future healthcare foundation models.

Abstract: Despite recent efforts in Large Language Models (LLMs) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs are still able to force harmful generations consistently. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. As these relaxations do not correspond to discrete input tokens, such latent training methods often leave models vulnerable to a diverse set of discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning (extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods; whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling alone cannot overcome.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in supporting model design and optimization for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale, synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training data. Our empirical results provide critical insights into the strengths and limitations of current ML methods, helping to guide more robust and practically relevant advances at the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial optimization. Our data is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CO-Bench/FrontierCO.

<title>ICYM2I: The illusion of multimodal informativeness under missingness</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning is of continued interest in artificial intelligence-based applications, motivated by the potential information gain from combining different types of data. However, modalities collected and curated during development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.

<title>Bigger Isn't Always Memorizing: Early Stopping Overparameterized Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e., memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models, generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs. memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized. We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models, but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.

Abstract: Inverse problems involving differential equations often require identifying unknown parameters or functions from data. Existing approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) and Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks (UPINNs), are effective at isolating either parameters or functions but can face challenges when applied simultaneously due to solution non-uniqueness. In this work, we introduce a framework that addresses these limitations by establishing conditions under which unique solutions can be guaranteed. To illustrate, we apply it to examples from biological systems and ecological dynamics, demonstrating accurate and interpretable results. Our approach significantly enhances the potential of machine learning techniques in modeling complex systems in science and engineering.

Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and inverse problems in the context of PDEs.

Abstract: Prompting is one of the main ways to adapt a pretrained model to target tasks. Besides manually constructing prompts, many prompt optimization methods have been proposed in the literature. Method development is mainly empirically driven, with less emphasis on a conceptual understanding of prompting. In this paper we discuss how optimal prompting can be understood through a Bayesian view, which also implies some fundamental limitations of prompting that can only be overcome by tuning weights. The paper explains in detail how meta-trained neural networks behave as Bayesian predictors over the pretraining distribution, whose hallmark feature is rapid in-context adaptation. Optimal prompting can be studied formally as conditioning these Bayesian predictors, yielding criteria for target tasks where optimal prompting is and is not possible. We support the theory with educational experiments on LSTMs and Transformers, where we compare different versions of prefix-tuning and different weight-tuning methods. We also confirm that soft prefixes, which are sequences of real-valued vectors outside the token alphabet, can lead to very effective prompts for trained and even untrained networks by manipulating activations in ways that are not achievable by hard tokens. This adds an important mechanistic aspect beyond the conceptual Bayesian theory.

<title>When Are Concepts Erased From Diffusion Models?</title>

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts. Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce RIPT-VLA, a simple and scalable reinforcement-learning-based interactive post-training paradigm that fine-tunes pretrained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using only sparse binary success rewards. Existing VLA training pipelines rely heavily on offline expert demonstration data and supervised imitation, limiting their ability to adapt to new tasks and environments under low-data regimes. RIPT-VLA addresses this by enabling interactive post-training with a stable policy optimization algorithm based on dynamic rollout sampling and leave-one-out advantage estimation.
  RIPT-VLA has the following characteristics. First, it applies to various VLA models, resulting in an improvement on the lightweight QueST model by 21.2%, and the 7B OpenVLA-OFT model to an unprecedented 97.5% success rate. Second, it is computationally efficient and data-efficient: with only one demonstration, RIPT-VLA enables an unworkable SFT model (4%) to succeed with a 97% success rate within 15 iterations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policy learned by RIPT-VLA generalizes across different tasks and scenarios and is robust to the initial state context. These results highlight RIPT-VLA as a practical and effective paradigm for post-training VLA models through minimal supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

<title>UltraEdit: Training-, Subject-, and Memory-Free Lifelong Editing in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing. ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3 the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a 24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

Abstract: The task of inverting real images into StyleGAN's latent space to manipulate their attributes has been extensively studied. However, existing GAN inversion methods struggle to balance high reconstruction quality, effective editability, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaStyle, an efficient single-stage encoder-based approach for GAN inversion and editing that leverages vision state-space models (VSSMs) to address these challenges. Specifically, our approach integrates VSSMs within the proposed architecture, enabling high-quality image inversion and flexible editing with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that MambaStyle achieves a superior balance among inversion accuracy, editing quality, and computational efficiency. Notably, our method achieves superior inversion and editing results with reduced model complexity and faster inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in resource-constrained embedded systems requires innovative algorithmic solutions to facilitate their energy and memory efficiency. To further ensure the reliability of these systems against malicious actors, recent works have extensively studied adversarial robustness of existing architectures. Our work focuses on the intersection of adversarial robustness, memory- and energy-efficiency in neural networks. We introduce a neural network conversion algorithm designed to produce sparse and adversarially robust spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging the sparse connectivity and weights from a robustly pretrained artificial neural network (ANN). Our approach combines the energy-efficient architecture of SNNs with a novel conversion algorithm, leading to state-of-the-art performance with enhanced energy and memory efficiency through sparse connectivity and activations. Our models are shown to achieve up to 100x reduction in the number of weights to be stored in memory, with an estimated 8.6x increase in energy efficiency compared to dense SNNs, while maintaining high performance and robustness against adversarial threats.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex, decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-preserving decision-making systems has become critical. This paper introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN) leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare. This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing, evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI in real-world, privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently, data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this, we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three baseline methods.

Abstract: $\textbf{Graph Coarsening (GC)}$ is a prominent graph reduction technique that compresses large graphs to enable efficient learning and inference. However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to $\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable $\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a $\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening. Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic, heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic integrity of the original graph.

Abstract: Brain stroke remains one of the principal causes of death and disability worldwide, yet most tabular-data prediction models still hover below the 95% accuracy threshold, limiting real-world utility. Addressing this gap, the present work develops and validates a completely data-driven and interpretable machine-learning framework designed to predict strokes using ten routinely gathered demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables sourced from a public cohort of 4,981 records. We employ a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and distribution, followed by rigorous data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier removal, and class imbalance correction using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). To streamline feature selection, point-biserial correlation and random-forest Gini importance were utilized, and ten varied algorithms-encompassing tree ensembles, boosting, kernel methods, and a multilayer neural network-were optimized using stratified five-fold cross-validation. Their predictions based on probabilities helped us build the proposed model, which included Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a support-vector classifier, with logistic regression acting as a meta-learner. The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.2% and an F1-score of 97.15%, indicating a significant enhancement compared to the leading individual model, LightGBM, which had an accuracy of 91.4%. Our study's findings indicate that rigorous preprocessing, coupled with a diverse hybrid model, can convert low-cost tabular data into a nearly clinical-grade stroke-risk assessment tool.

Abstract: In today's world, modern infrastructures are being equipped with information and communication technologies to create large IoT networks.
  It is essential to monitor these networks to ensure smooth operations by detecting and correcting link failures or abnormal network behaviour proactively, which can otherwise cause interruptions in business operations.
  This paper presents a novel method for detecting anomalies in wireless links using graph neural networks. The proposed approach involves converting time series data into graphs and training a new graph neural network architecture based on graph attention networks that successfully detects anomalies at the level of individual measurements of the time series data. The model provides competitive results compared to the state of the art while being computationally more efficient with ~171 times fewer trainable parameters.

Deep learning models, in particular, have seen wide application in mobile networking and communications to support advanced services in emerging wireless environments, such as smart healthcare, smart grids, autonomous vehicles, aerial platforms, digital twins, and the metaverse. The rapid expansion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, many with limited computational capabilities, has accelerated the development of tiny machine learning (TinyML) and resource-efficient ML approaches for cost-effective services. However, the deployment of large-scale machine learning (LargeML) solutions require major computing resources and complex management strategies to support extensive IoT services and ML-generated content applications. Consequently, the integration of TinyML and LargeML is projected as a promising approach for future seamless connectivity and efficient resource management.
  Although the integration of TinyML and LargeML shows abundant potential, several challenges persist, including performance optimization, practical deployment strategies, effective resource management, and security considerations. In this survey, we review and analyze the latest research aimed at enabling the integration of TinyML and LargeML models for the realization of smart services and applications in future 6G networks and beyond. The paper concludes by outlining critical challenges and identifying future research directions for the holistic integration of TinyML and LargeML in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Causal discovery in multi-omic datasets is crucial for understanding the bigger picture of gene regulatory mechanisms, but remains challenging due to high dimensionality, differentiation of direct from indirect relationships, and hidden confounders. We introduce GENESIS (GEne Network inference from Expression SIgnals and SNPs), a constraint-based algorithm that leverages the natural causal precedence of genotypes to infer ancestral relationships in transcriptomic data. Unlike traditional causal discovery methods that start with a fully connected graph, GENESIS initialises an empty ancestrality matrix and iteratively populates it with direct, indirect or non-causal relationships using a series of provably sound marginal and conditional independence tests. By integrating genotypes as fixed causal anchors, GENESIS provides a principled ``head start'' to classical causal discovery algorithms, restricting the search space to biologically plausible edges. We test GENESIS on synthetic and real-world genomic datasets. This framework offers a powerful avenue for uncovering causal pathways in complex traits, with promising applications to functional genomics, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

Abstract: Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity, replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in counterfactual image retrieval.

<title>Highlighting What Matters: Promptable Embeddings for Attribute-Focused Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

<title>CoT Information: Improved Sample Complexity under Chain-of-Thought Supervision</title>

Abstract: Learning complex functions that involve multi-step reasoning poses a significant challenge for standard supervised learning from input-output examples. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, which provides intermediate reasoning steps together with the final output, has emerged as a powerful empirical technique, underpinning much of the recent progress in the reasoning capabilities of large language models. This paper develops a statistical theory of learning under CoT supervision. A key characteristic of the CoT setting, in contrast to standard supervision, is the mismatch between the training objective (CoT risk) and the test objective (end-to-end risk). A central part of our analysis, distinguished from prior work, is explicitly linking those two types of risk to achieve sharper sample complexity bounds. This is achieved via the *CoT information measure* $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D}, h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, which quantifies the additional discriminative power gained from observing the reasoning process. The main theoretical results demonstrate how CoT supervision can yield significantly faster learning rates compared to standard E2E supervision. Specifically, it is shown that the sample complexity required to achieve a target E2E error $\epsilon$ scales as $d/\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D}, h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, where $d$ is a measure of hypothesis class complexity, which can be much faster than standard $d/\epsilon$ rates. Information-theoretic lower bounds in terms of the CoT information are also obtained. Together, these results suggest that CoT information is a fundamental measure of statistical complexity for learning under chain-of-thought supervision.

Abstract: We address the problem of verifying automatically procedural programs manipulating parametric-size arrays of integers, encoded as a constrained Horn clauses solving problem. We propose a new algorithmic method for synthesizing loop invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions represented as universally quantified first-order formulas constraining the array elements and program variables. We adopt a data-driven approach that extends the decision tree Horn-ICE framework to handle arrays. We provide a powerful learning technique based on reducing a complex classification problem of vectors of integer arrays to a simpler classification problem of vectors of integers. The obtained classifier is generalized to get universally quantified invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions. We have implemented our method and shown its efficiency and competitiveness w.r.t. state-of-the-art tools on a significant benchmark.

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

Abstract: The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories, offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

Abstract: College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and depression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117), participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly, secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like depression.

<title>Diffusion Probabilistic Generative Models for Accelerated, in-NICU Permanent Magnet Neonatal MRI</title>

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of brain abnormalities during early life development. Permanent magnet scanners operating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick infants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion probabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting for these challenges.
  Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal MR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical Center. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our real-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support varying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class embedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and (4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling experiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed methodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric neuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x under-sampled data.
  Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior samples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative model decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at two acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that proposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are adequate for clinical use.
  Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the proposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan time of in-NICU neonatal MRI.

Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language models, such as inverse incentive training.

<title>Causal LLM Routing: End-to-End Regret Minimization from Observational Data</title>

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query, balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy, where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models, which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance across different embedding models.

Abstract: Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations (94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity. Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.

Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder, oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable and objective tool for mental health assessment.

Abstract: We propose PO-Flow, a novel continuous normalizing flow (CNF) framework for causal inference that jointly models potential outcomes and counterfactuals. Trained via flow matching, PO-Flow provides a unified framework for individualized potential outcome prediction, counterfactual predictions, and uncertainty-aware density learning. Among generative models, it is the first to enable density learning of potential outcomes without requiring explicit distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian mixtures), while also supporting counterfactual prediction conditioned on factual outcomes in general observational datasets. On benchmarks such as ACIC, IHDP, and IBM, it consistently outperforms prior methods across a range of causal inference tasks. Beyond that, PO-Flow succeeds in high-dimensional settings, including counterfactual image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

<title>Oh SnapMMD! Forecasting Stochastic Dynamics Beyond the Schr\"odinger Bridge's End</title>

Abstract: Scientists often want to make predictions beyond the observed time horizon of "snapshot" data following latent stochastic dynamics. For example, in time course single-cell mRNA profiling, scientists have access to cellular transcriptional state measurements (snapshots) from different biological replicates at different time points, but they cannot access the trajectory of any one cell because measurement destroys the cell. Researchers want to forecast (e.g.) differentiation outcomes from early state measurements of stem cells. Recent Schr\"odinger-bridge (SB) methods are natural for interpolating between snapshots. But past SB papers have not addressed forecasting -- likely since existing methods either (1) reduce to following pre-set reference dynamics (chosen before seeing data) or (2) require the user to choose a fixed, state-independent volatility since they minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence. Either case can lead to poor forecasting quality. In the present work, we propose a new framework, SnapMMD, that learns dynamics by directly fitting the joint distribution of both state measurements and observation time with a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. Unlike past work, our method allows us to infer unknown and state-dependent volatilities from the observed data. We show in a variety of real and synthetic experiments that our method delivers accurate forecasts. Moreover, our approach allows us to learn in the presence of incomplete state measurements and yields an $R^2$-style statistic that diagnoses fit. We also find that our method's performance at interpolation (and general velocity-field reconstruction) is at least as good as (and often better than) state-of-the-art in almost all of our experiments.

Abstract: We investigate scaling laws for stochastic momentum algorithms with small batch on the power law random features model, parameterized by data complexity, target complexity, and model size. When trained with a stochastic momentum algorithm, our analysis reveals four distinct loss curve shapes determined by varying data-target complexities. While traditional stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGD-M) yields identical scaling law exponents to SGD, dimension-adapted Nesterov acceleration (DANA) improves these exponents by scaling momentum hyperparameters based on model size and data complexity. This outscaling phenomenon, which also improves compute-optimal scaling behavior, is achieved by DANA across a broad range of data and target complexities, while traditional methods fall short. Extensive experiments on high-dimensional synthetic quadratics validate our theoretical predictions and large-scale text experiments with LSTMs show DANA's improved loss exponents over SGD hold in a practical setting.

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However, we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

Abstract: In this paper, we apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the study of the string landscape and swampland in 6-dimensions. Our data are the (almost) anomaly-free 6-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ supergravity models, characterised by the Gram matrix of anomaly coefficients. Our work demonstrates the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently learn highly complex features of the landscape and swampland. Employing an autoencoder for unsupervised learning, we provide an auto-classification of these models by compressing the Gram matrix data to 2-dimensions. Through compression, similar models cluster together, and we identify prominent features of these clusters. The autoencoder also identifies outlier models which are difficult to reconstruct. One of these outliers proves to be incredibly difficult to combine with other models such that the $\text{tr}R^{4}$ anomaly vanishes, making its presence in the landscape extremely rare. Further, we utilise supervised learning to build two classifiers predicting (1) model consistency under probe string insertion (precision: 0.78, predicting consistency for 214,837 models with reasonable certainty) and (2) inconsistency under anomaly inflow (precision: 0.91, predicting inconsistency for 1,909,359 models). Notably, projecting these predictions onto the autoencoder's 2-dimensional latent layer shows consistent models clustering together, further indicating that the autoencoder has learnt interesting and complex features of the set of models and potentially offers a novel approach to mapping the landscape and swampland of 6-dimensional supergravity theories.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty, syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g., correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages, undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in free-word-order languages like Hindi.

Abstract: Existing reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to capture authentic creativity, often rewarding memorization of previously observed patterns. We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning. Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs (``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This study introduces an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to extract macroeconomic alpha from global news sentiment. We process the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project's worldwide news feed using FinBERT -- a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based model pretrained on finance-specific language -- to construct daily sentiment indices incorporating mean tone, dispersion, and event impact. These indices drive an XGBoost classifier, benchmarked against logistic regression, to predict next-day returns for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and 10-year U.S. Treasury futures (ZN). Rigorous out-of-sample (OOS) backtesting (5-fold expanding-window cross-validation, OOS period: c. 2017-April 2025) demonstrates exceptional, cost-adjusted performance for the XGBoost strategy: Sharpe ratios achieve 5.87 (EUR/USD), 4.65 (USD/JPY), and 4.65 (Treasuries), with respective compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) exceeding 50% in Foreign Exchange (FX) and 22% in bonds. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) affirm that sentiment dispersion and article impact are key predictive features. Our findings establish that integrating domain-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) with interpretable ML offers a potent and explainable source of macro alpha.

<title>Exponential Convergence of CAVI for Bayesian PCA</title>

Abstract: Probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) and its Bayesian variant (BPCA) are widely used for dimension reduction in machine learning and statistics. The main advantage of probabilistic PCA over the traditional formulation is allowing uncertainty quantification. The parameters of BPCA are typically learned using mean-field variational inference, and in particular, the coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) algorithm. So far, the convergence speed of CAVI for BPCA has not been characterized. In our paper, we fill this gap in the literature. Firstly, we prove a precise exponential convergence result in the case where the model uses a single principal component (PC). Interestingly, this result is established through a connection with the classical $\textit{power iteration algorithm}$ and it indicates that traditional PCA is retrieved as points estimates of the BPCA parameters. Secondly, we leverage recent tools to prove exponential convergence of CAVI for the model with any number of PCs, thus leading to a more general result, but one that is of a slightly different flavor. To prove the latter result, we additionally needed to introduce a novel lower bound for the symmetric Kullback--Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions, which, we believe, is of independent interest in information theory.

<title>Steering LVLMs via Sparse Autoencoder for Hallucination Mitigation</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on multimodal tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning. However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications. Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations. Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify semantic directions closely associated with either hallucinations or actuality, realizing more precise and direct hallucination-related representations. Our analysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we identified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

Abstract: Quantifying differences between probability distributions is fundamental to statistics and machine learning, primarily for comparing statistical uncertainty. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (EU) -- due to incomplete knowledge -- requires richer representations than those offered by classical probability. Imprecise probability (IP) theory offers such models, capturing ambiguity and partial belief. This has driven growing interest in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML), where inference and decision-making rely on broader uncertainty models -- highlighting the need for metrics beyond classical probability. This work introduces the Integral Imprecise Probability Metric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical Integral Probability Metric (IPM) to the setting of capacities -- a broad class of IP models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities, probability intervals, belief functions, and more. Theoretically, we establish conditions under which IIPM serves as a valid metric and metrises a form of weak convergence of capacities. Practically, IIPM not only enables comparison across different IP models but also supports the quantification of epistemic uncertainty within a single IP model. In particular, by comparing an IP model with its conjugate, IIPM gives rise to a new class of EU measures -- Maximum Mean Imprecision -- which satisfy key axiomatic properties proposed in the Uncertainty Quantification literature. We validate MMI through selective classification experiments, demonstrating strong empirical performance against established EU measures, and outperforming them when classical methods struggle to scale to a large number of classes. Our work advances both theory and practice in IPML, offering a principled framework for comparing and quantifying epistemic uncertainty under imprecision.

<title>SpecMaskFoley: Steering Pretrained Spectral Masked Generative Transformer Toward Synchronized Video-to-audio Synthesis via ControlNet</title>

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

<title>A Scalable Hierarchical Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles</title>

Abstract: Due to its nature of dynamic, mobility, and wireless data transfer, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is prone to various cyber threats, ranging from spoofing and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks to malware. To safeguard the IoV ecosystem from intrusions, malicious activities, policy violations, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a critical role by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic to identify and mitigate potential threats in real-time. However, most existing research has focused on developing centralized, machine learning-based IDS systems for IoV without accounting for its inherently distributed nature. Due to intensive computing requirements, these centralized systems often rely on the cloud to detect cyber threats, increasing delay of system response. On the other hand, edge nodes typically lack the necessary resources to train and deploy complex machine learning algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes an effective hierarchical classification framework tailored for IoV networks. Hierarchical classification allows classifiers to be trained and tested at different levels, enabling edge nodes to detect specific types of attacks independently. With this approach, edge nodes can conduct targeted attack detection while leveraging cloud nodes for comprehensive threat analysis and support. Given the resource constraints of edge nodes, we have employed the Boruta feature selection method to reduce data dimensionality, optimizing processing efficiency. To evaluate our proposed framework, we utilize the latest IoV security dataset CIC-IoV2024, achieving promising results that demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our models in securing IoV networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

<title>Generalized Power Priors for Improved Bayesian Inference with Historical Data</title>

Abstract: The power prior is a class of informative priors designed to incorporate historical data alongside current data in a Bayesian framework. It includes a power parameter that controls the influence of historical data, providing flexibility and adaptability. A key property of the power prior is that the resulting posterior minimizes a linear combination of KL divergences between two pseudo-posterior distributions: one ignoring historical data and the other fully incorporating it. We extend this framework by identifying the posterior distribution as the minimizer of a linear combination of Amari's $\alpha$-divergence, a generalization of KL divergence. We show that this generalization can lead to improved performance by allowing for the data to adapt to appropriate choices of the $\alpha$ parameter. Theoretical properties of this generalized power posterior are established, including behavior as a generalized geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of probability distributions, offering novel insights into its geometric interpretation.

Abstract: Label shift adaptation aims to recover target class priors when the labelled source distribution $P$ and the unlabelled target distribution $Q$ share $P(X \mid Y) = Q(X \mid Y)$ but $P(Y) \neq Q(Y)$. Classical black-box shift estimators invert an empirical confusion matrix of a frozen classifier, producing a brittle point estimate that ignores sampling noise and similarity among classes. We present Graph-Smoothed Bayesian BBSE (GS-B$^3$SE), a fully probabilistic alternative that places Laplacian-Gaussian priors on both target log-priors and confusion-matrix columns, tying them together on a label-similarity graph. The resulting posterior is tractable with HMC or a fast block Newton-CG scheme. We prove identifiability, $N^{-1/2}$ contraction, variance bounds that shrink with the graph's algebraic connectivity, and robustness to Laplacian misspecification. We also reinterpret GS-B$^3$SE through information geometry, showing that it generalizes existing shift estimators.

Abstract: This study develops a higher-order asymptotic framework for test-time adaptation (TTA) of Batch Normalization (BN) statistics under distribution shift by integrating classical Edgeworth expansion and saddlepoint approximation techniques with a novel one-step M-estimation perspective. By analyzing the statistical discrepancy between training and test distributions, we derive an Edgeworth expansion for the normalized difference in BN means and obtain an optimal weighting parameter that minimizes the mean-squared error of the adapted statistic. Reinterpreting BN TTA as a one-step M-estimator allows us to derive higher-order local asymptotic normality results, which incorporate skewness and other higher moments into the estimator's behavior. Moreover, we quantify the trade-offs among bias, variance, and skewness in the adaptation process and establish a corresponding generalization bound on the model risk. The refined saddlepoint approximations further deliver uniformly accurate density and tail probability estimates for the BN TTA statistic. These theoretical insights provide a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order corrections and robust one-step updating can enhance the reliability and performance of BN layers in adapting to changing data distributions.

Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of atomistic systems, but its reliance on sequential numerical integration limits simulation efficiency. We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the conventional ab initio MD. The model's flexible design supports diverse application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary conditions, and interaction types. By overcoming the intrinsic speed barrier of conventional MD, MDtrajNet-1 opens new frontiers in efficient and scalable atomistic simulations.

Abstract: Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However, existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability, especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO (Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH, performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency, and broad applicability.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have enabled the generation of personalized content that adapts to up-to-date user context. While personalized decision systems are often modeled using bandit formulations, the integration of GenAI introduces new structure into otherwise classical sequential learning problems. In GenAI-powered interventions, the agent selects a query, but the environment experiences a stochastic response drawn from the generative model. Standard bandit methods do not explicitly account for this structure, where actions influence rewards only through stochastic, observed treatments. We introduce generator-mediated bandit-Thompson sampling (GAMBITTS), a bandit approach designed for this action/treatment split, using mobile health interventions with large language model-generated text as a motivating case study. GAMBITTS explicitly models both the treatment and reward generation processes, using information in the delivered treatment to accelerate policy learning relative to standard methods. We establish regret bounds for GAMBITTS by decomposing sources of uncertainty in treatment and reward, identifying conditions where it achieves stronger guarantees than standard bandit approaches. In simulation studies, GAMBITTS consistently outperforms conventional algorithms by leveraging observed treatments to more accurately estimate expected rewards.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry, BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4 million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE), which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks, including classification, clustering and outlier detection.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) linear regression has received significant attention in the recent theoretical literature, with several works aimed at obtaining improved error rates. A common approach is to set the clipping constant much larger than the expected norm of the per-sample gradients. While simplifying the analysis, this is however in sharp contrast with what empirical evidence suggests to optimize performance. Our work bridges this gap between theory and practice: we provide sharper rates for DP stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) by crucially operating in a regime where clipping happens frequently. Specifically, we consider the setting where the data is multivariate Gaussian, the number of training samples $n$ is proportional to the input dimension $d$, and the algorithm guarantees constant-order zero concentrated DP. Our method relies on establishing a deterministic equivalent for the trajectory of DP-SGD in terms of a family of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). As a consequence, the risk of DP-SGD is bounded between two ODEs, with upper and lower bounds matching for isotropic data. By studying these ODEs when $n / d$ is large enough, we demonstrate the optimality of aggressive clipping, and we uncover the benefits of decaying learning rate and private noise scheduling.

Abstract: With increased 5G deployments, network densification is higher than ever to support the exponentially high throughput requirements. However, this has meant a significant increase in energy consumption, leading to higher operational expenditure (OpEx) for network operators creating an acute need for improvements in network energy savings (NES). A key determinant of operational efficacy in cellular networks is the user association (UA) policy, as it affects critical aspects like spectral efficiency, load balancing etc. and therefore impacts the overall energy consumption of the network directly. Furthermore, with cellular network topologies lending themselves well to graphical abstractions, use of graphs in network optimization has gained significant prominence. In this work, we propose and analyze a graphical abstraction based optimization for UA in cellular networks to improve NES by determining when energy saving features like cell switch off can be activated. A comparison with legacy approaches establishes the superiority of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

<title>PaTH Attention: Position Encoding via Accumulating Householder Transformations</title>

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models (LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant, position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to RoPE and other recent baselines.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training. To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star. The code is available at https://github.com/dongguanting/Tool-Star.

<title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models through Image-Guided Head Suppression</title>

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference, without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is available at https://github.com/YUECHE77/SPIN.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

<title>Ranked Entropy Minimization for Continual Test-Time Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt to realistic environments in an online manner by learning during test time. Entropy minimization has emerged as a principal strategy for test-time adaptation due to its efficiency and adaptability. Nevertheless, it remains underexplored in continual test-time adaptation, where stability is more important. We observe that the entropy minimization method often suffers from model collapse, where the model converges to predicting a single class for all images due to a trivial solution. We propose ranked entropy minimization to mitigate the stability problem of the entropy minimization method and extend its applicability to continuous scenarios. Our approach explicitly structures the prediction difficulty through a progressive masking strategy. Specifically, it gradually aligns the model's probability distributions across different levels of prediction difficulty while preserving the rank order of entropy. The proposed method is extensively evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness through empirical results. Our code is available at https://github.com/pilsHan/rem

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation time.

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches. Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where $m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiable learn these distributions and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. Moreover, we extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However, applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to different evolutionary computation methods.

Abstract: Maintaining robust 3D perception under dynamic and unpredictable test-time conditions remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints, enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality. Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training. Code and pretrained models are released in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years, especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions, specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current state-of-the-art model architectures.

Abstract: High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models (LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

Abstract: Tabular data, ubiquitous and rich in informational value, is an increasing focus for deep representation learning, yet progress is hindered by studies centered on single tables or isolated databases, which limits model capabilities due to data scale. While collaborative learning approaches such as federated learning, transfer learning, split learning, and tabular foundation models aim to learn from multiple correlated databases, they are challenged by a scarcity of real-world interconnected tabular resources. Current data lakes and corpora largely consist of isolated databases lacking defined inter-database correlations. To overcome this, we introduce WikiDBGraph, a large-scale graph of 100,000 real-world tabular databases from WikiData, interconnected by 17 million edges and characterized by 13 node and 12 edge properties derived from its database schema and data distribution. WikiDBGraph's weighted edges identify both instance- and feature-overlapped databases. Experiments on these newly identified databases confirm that collaborative learning yields superior performance, thereby offering considerable promise for structured foundation model training while also exposing key challenges and future directions for learning from interconnected tabular data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger bridge problem which, given ensemble measurements of the initial and final configurations of a stochastic dynamical system and some prior knowledge on the dynamics, aims to reconstruct the "most likely" evolution of the system compatible with the data. Most existing literature assume Brownian reference dynamics and are implicitly limited to potential-driven dynamics. We depart from this regime and consider reference processes described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with generic drift matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$. When $\mathbf{A}$ is asymmetric, this corresponds to a non-equilibrium system with non-conservative forces at play: this is important for applications to biological systems, which are naturally exist out-of-equilibrium. In the case of Gaussian marginals, we derive explicit expressions that characterise the solution of both the static and dynamic Schr\"odinger bridge. For general marginals, we propose mvOU-OTFM, a simulation-free algorithm based on flow and score matching for learning the Schr\"odinger bridge. In application to a range of problems based on synthetic and real single cell data, we demonstrate that mvOU-OTFM achieves higher accuracy compared to competing methods, whilst being significantly faster to train.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens, overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks. With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under dimension-free conditions.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models, like their classical counterparts, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, hindering their secure deployment. Here, we report the first systematic experimental robustness benchmark for 20-qubit quantum neural network (QNN) classifiers executed on a superconducting processor. Our benchmarking framework features an efficient adversarial attack algorithm designed for QNNs, enabling quantitative characterization of adversarial robustness and robustness bounds. From our analysis, we verify that adversarial training reduces sensitivity to targeted perturbations by regularizing input gradients, significantly enhancing QNN's robustness. Additionally, our analysis reveals that QNNs exhibit superior adversarial robustness compared to classical neural networks, an advantage attributed to inherent quantum noise. Furthermore, the empirical upper bound extracted from our attack experiments shows a minimal deviation ($3 \times 10^{-3}$) from the theoretical lower bound, providing strong experimental confirmation of the attack's effectiveness and the tightness of fidelity-based robustness bounds. This work establishes a critical experimental framework for assessing and improving quantum adversarial robustness, paving the way for secure and reliable QML applications.

Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

<title>Robust LLM Fingerprinting via Domain-Specific Watermarks</title>

Abstract: As open-source language models (OSMs) grow more capable and are widely shared and finetuned, ensuring model provenance, i.e., identifying the origin of a given model instance, has become an increasingly important issue. At the same time, existing backdoor-based model fingerprinting techniques often fall short of achieving key requirements of real-world model ownership detection. In this work, we build on the observation that while current open-source model watermarks fail to achieve reliable content traceability, they can be effectively adapted to address the challenge of model provenance. To this end, we introduce the concept of domain-specific watermarking for model fingerprinting. Rather than watermarking all generated content, we train the model to embed watermarks only within specified subdomains (e.g., particular languages or topics). This targeted approach ensures detection reliability, while improving watermark durability and quality under a range of real-world deployment settings. Our evaluations show that domain-specific watermarking enables model fingerprinting with strong statistical guarantees, controllable false positive rates, high detection power, and preserved generation quality. Moreover, we find that our fingerprints are inherently stealthy and naturally robust to real-world variability across deployment scenarios.

<title>TRIM: Achieving Extreme Sparsity with Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven Pruning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16743</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions (rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at: https://github.com/flobk/TRIM

Abstract: As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial role of dataset design in preserving model alignment. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/accidental_misalignment.

<title>LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols</title>

Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous, cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for future AI-native wireless standards.

<title>Unlearning Isn't Deletion: Investigating Reversibility of Machine Unlearning in LLMs</title>

arXiv:2505.16831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. We show that these metrics can be misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may obscure information rather than erase it. To diagnose this phenomenon, we introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information. Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code, math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between reversible and irreversible forgetting. In reversible cases, models suffer token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper representational damage occurs. We further provide a theoretical account linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and hyperparameters. Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning in LLMs. We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes under unlearning and relearning: https://github.com/XiaoyuXU1/Representational_Analysis_Tools.git.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2% improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations. EduVisBench and EduVisAgent are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisBench and https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisAgent.

Abstract: Continual post-training adapts a single text-to-image diffusion model to learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naive post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines zero-shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3) catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image models.

Abstract: We present a generalised Hanson-Wright inequality and use it to establish new statistical insights into the geometry of data point-clouds. In the setting of a general random function model of data, we clarify the roles played by three notions of dimensionality: ambient intrinsic dimension $p_{\mathrm{int}}$, which measures total variability across orthogonal feature directions; correlation rank, which measures functional complexity across samples; and latent intrinsic dimension, which is the dimension of manifold structure hidden in data. Our analysis shows that in order for persistence diagrams to reveal latent homology and for manifold structure to emerge it is sufficient that $p_{\mathrm{int}}\gg \log n$, where $n$ is the sample size. Informed by these theoretical perspectives, we revisit the ground-breaking neuroscience discovery of toroidal structure in grid-cell activity made by Gardner et al. (Nature, 2022): our findings reveal, for the first time, evidence that this structure is in fact isometric to physical space, meaning that grid cell activity conveys a geometrically faithful representation of the real world.

<title>Don't "Overthink" Passage Reranking: Is Reasoning Truly Necessary?</title>

Abstract: With the growing success of reasoning models across complex natural language tasks, researchers in the Information Retrieval (IR) community have begun exploring how similar reasoning capabilities can be integrated into passage rerankers built on Large Language Models (LLMs). These methods typically employ an LLM to produce an explicit, step-by-step reasoning process before arriving at a final relevance prediction. But, does reasoning actually improve reranking accuracy? In this paper, we dive deeper into this question, studying the impact of the reasoning process by comparing reasoning-based pointwise rerankers (ReasonRR) to standard, non-reasoning pointwise rerankers (StandardRR) under identical training conditions, and observe that StandardRR generally outperforms ReasonRR. Building on this observation, we then study the importance of reasoning to ReasonRR by disabling its reasoning process (ReasonRR-NoReason), and find that ReasonRR-NoReason is surprisingly more effective than ReasonRR. Examining the cause of this result, our findings reveal that reasoning-based rerankers are limited by the LLM's reasoning process, which pushes it toward polarized relevance scores and thus fails to consider the partial relevance of passages, a key factor for the accuracy of pointwise rerankers.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency maps for identifying influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of their robustness to noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful information rather than random artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.

<title>Power-Law Decay Loss for Large Language Model Finetuning: Focusing on Information Sparsity to Enhance Generation Quality</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus, following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information, thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue systems, and style transfer.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Abstract: A reliable uncertainty estimation method is the foundation of many modern out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, which are critical for safe deployments of deep learning models in the open world. In this work, we propose TULiP, a theoretically-driven post-hoc uncertainty estimator for OOD detection. Our approach considers a hypothetical perturbation applied to the network before convergence. Based on linearized training dynamics, we bound the effect of such perturbation, resulting in an uncertainty score computable by perturbing model parameters. Ultimately, our approach computes uncertainty from a set of sampled predictions. We visualize our bound on synthetic regression and classification datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TULiP using large-scale OOD detection benchmarks for image classification. Our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance, particularly for near-distribution samples.

Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations, it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering. Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated, principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.

<title>Efficient Correlation Volume Sampling for Ultra-High-Resolution Optical Flow Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent optical flow estimation methods often employ local cost sampling from a dense all-pairs correlation volume. This results in quadratic computational and memory complexity in the number of pixels. Although an alternative memory-efficient implementation with on-demand cost computation exists, this is slower in practice and therefore prior methods typically process images at reduced resolutions, missing fine-grained details.
  To address this, we propose a more efficient implementation of the all-pairs correlation volume sampling, still matching the exact mathematical operator as defined by RAFT. Our approach outperforms on-demand sampling by up to 90% while maintaining low memory usage, and performs on par with the default implementation with up to 95% lower memory usage. As cost sampling makes up a significant portion of the overall runtime, this can translate to up to 50% savings for the total end-to-end model inference in memory-constrained environments. Our evaluation of existing methods includes an 8K ultra-high-resolution dataset and an additional inference-time modification of the recent SEA-RAFT method. With this, we achieve state-of-the-art results at high resolutions both in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering, validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence, capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

Abstract: We introduce \texttt{CASS}, the first large-scale dataset and model suite for cross-architecture GPU code transpilation, targeting both source-level (CUDA~$\leftrightarrow$~HIP) and assembly-level (Nvidia SASS~$\leftrightarrow$~AMD RDNA3) translation. The dataset comprises 70k verified code pairs across host and device, addressing a critical gap in low-level GPU code portability. Leveraging this resource, we train the \texttt{CASS} family of domain-specific language models, achieving 95\% source translation accuracy and 37.5\% assembly translation accuracy, substantially outperforming commercial baselines such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Hipify. Our generated code matches native performance in over 85\% of test cases, preserving runtime and memory behavior. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce \texttt{CASS-Bench}, a curated benchmark spanning 16 GPU domains with ground-truth execution. All data, models, and evaluation tools are released as open source to foster progress in GPU compiler tooling, binary compatibility, and LLM-guided hardware translation. Dataset and benchmark are on \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/cass}{\textcolor{blue}{HuggingFace}}, with code at \href{https://github.com/GustavoStahl/CASS}{\textcolor{blue}{GitHub}}.

<title>Extremely Simple Multimodal Outlier Synthesis for Out-of-Distribution Detection and Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and segmentation are crucial for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. While prior research has primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370 \times$ speedup. Our source code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/mona4399/FeatureMixing.

Abstract: Uniform downsampling remains the de facto standard for reducing spatial resolution in vision backbones. In this work, we propose an alternative design built around a content-aware spatial grouping layer, that dynamically assigns tokens to a reduced set based on image boundaries and their semantic content. Stacking our grouping layer across consecutive backbone stages results in hierarchical segmentation that arises natively in the feature extraction process, resulting in our coined Native Segmentation Vision Transformer. We show that a careful design of our architecture enables the emergence of strong segmentation masks solely from grouping layers, that is, without additional segmentation-specific heads. This sets the foundation for a new paradigm of native, backbone-level segmentation, which enables strong zero-shot results without mask supervision, as well as a minimal and efficient standalone model design for downstream segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge, grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating a potential divergence in the number of critical points.

Abstract: During periods of quiescence, such as sleep, neural activity in many brain circuits resembles that observed during periods of task engagement. However, the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which, in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization in noisy neural circuits.

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic images from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify multiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this, we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial relationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in image generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning capabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we make our code and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/gogoduan/GoT-R1.

Abstract: Over the past few years, the federated learning ($\texttt{FL}$) community has witnessed a proliferation of new $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. However, our understating of the theory of $\texttt{FL}$ is still fragmented, and a thorough, formal comparison of these algorithms remains elusive. Motivated by this gap, we show that many of the existing $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms can be understood from an operator splitting point of view. This unification allows us to compare different algorithms with ease, to refine previous convergence results and to uncover new algorithmic variants. In particular, our analysis reveals the vital role played by the step size in $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. The unification also leads to a streamlined and economic way to accelerate $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms, without incurring any communication overhead. We perform numerical experiments on both convex and nonconvex models to validate our findings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables large-scale distributed training of machine learning models, while still allowing individual nodes to maintain data locally. However, executing FL at scale comes with inherent practical challenges: 1) heterogeneity of the local node data distributions, 2) heterogeneity of node computational speeds (asynchrony), but also 3) constraints in the amount of communication between the clients and the server. In this work, we present the first variant of the classic federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm which, at the same time, supports data heterogeneity, partial client asynchrony, and communication compression. Our algorithm comes with a novel, rigorous analysis showing that, in spite of these system relaxations, it can provide similar convergence to FedAvg in interesting parameter regimes. Experimental results in the rigorous LEAF benchmark on setups of up to 300 nodes show that our algorithm ensures fast convergence for standard federated tasks, improving upon prior quantized and asynchronous approaches.

Abstract: Regularization techniques are crucial to improving the generalization performance and training efficiency of deep neural networks. Many deep learning algorithms rely on weight decay, dropout, batch/layer normalization to converge faster and generalize. Label Smoothing (LS) is another simple, versatile and efficient regularization which can be applied to various supervised classification tasks. Conventional LS, however, regardless of the training instance assumes that each non-target class is equally likely. In this work, we present a general framework for training with label regularization, which includes conventional LS but can also model instance-specific variants. Based on this formulation, we propose an efficient way of learning LAbel regularization by devising a Bi-level Optimization (LABO) problem. We derive a deterministic and interpretable solution of the inner loop as the optimal label smoothing without the need to store the parameters or the output of a trained model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate our LABO consistently yields improvement over conventional label regularization on various fields, including seven machine translation and three image classification tasks across various

Abstract: Neural network (NN) designed for challenging machine learning tasks is in general a highly nonlinear mapping that contains massive variational parameters. High complexity of NN, if unbounded or unconstrained, might unpredictably cause severe issues including \R{overfitting}, loss of generalization power, and unbearable cost of hardware. In this work, we propose a general compression scheme that significantly reduces the variational parameters of NN's, despite of their specific types (linear, convolutional, \textit{etc}), by encoding them to deep \R{automatically differentiable} tensor network (ADTN) that contains exponentially-fewer free parameters. Superior compression performance of our scheme is demonstrated on several widely-recognized NN's (FC-2, LeNet-5, AlextNet, ZFNet and VGG-16) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). For instance, we compress two linear layers in VGG-16 with approximately $10^{7}$ parameters to two ADTN's with just 424 parameters, improving the testing accuracy on CIFAR-10 from $90.17\%$ to $91.74\%$. We argue that the deep structure of ADTN is an essential reason for the remarkable compression performance of ADTN, compared to existing compression schemes that are mainly based on tensor decompositions/factorization and shallow tensor networks. Our work suggests deep TN as an exceptionally efficient mathematical structure for representing the variational parameters of NN's, which exhibits superior compressibility over the commonly-used matrices and multi-way arrays.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven method for finding a closed-loop optimal controller, which minimizes a specified infinite-horizon cost function for systems with unknown dynamics given any arbitrary initial state. Suppose the closed-loop optimal controller can be parameterized by a given class of functions, hereafter referred to as the policy. The proposed method introduces a novel gradient estimation framework, which approximates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the policy parameters via integrating the Koopman operator with the classical concept of actor-critic. This enables the policy parameters to be tuned iteratively using gradient descent to achieve an optimal controller, leveraging the linearity of the Koopman operator. The convergence analysis of the proposed framework is provided. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through comparisons with a model-free reinforcement learning approach, and its control performance is further evaluated through simulations against model-based optimal control methods that solve the same optimal control problem utilizing the exact system dynamics.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms can often exhibit discriminatory behavior, negatively affecting certain populations across protected groups. To address this, numerous debiasing methods, and consequently evaluation measures, have been proposed. Current evaluation measures for debiasing methods suffer from two main limitations: (1) they primarily provide a global estimate of unfairness, failing to provide a more fine-grained analysis, and (2) they predominantly analyze the model output on a specific task, failing to generalize the findings to other tasks. In this work, we introduce Pointwise Normalized Kernel Alignment (PNKA), a pointwise representational similarity measure that addresses these limitations by measuring how debiasing measures affect the intermediate representations of individuals. On tabular data, the use of PNKA reveals previously unknown insights: while group fairness predominantly influences a small subset of the population, maintaining high representational similarity for the majority, individual fairness constraints uniformly impact representations across the entire population, altering nearly every data point. We show that by evaluating representations using PNKA, we can reliably predict the behavior of ML models trained on these representations. Moreover, applying PNKA to language embeddings shows that existing debiasing methods may not perform as intended, failing to remove biases from stereotypical words and sentences. Our findings suggest that current evaluation measures for debiasing methods are insufficient, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the effects of debiasing methods, and show how pointwise representational similarity metrics can help with fairness audits.

Abstract: Similar to surprising performance in the standard deep learning, deep nets trained by adversarial training also generalize well for unseen clean data (natural data). However, despite adversarial training can achieve low robust training error, there exists a significant robust generalization gap. We call this phenomenon the Clean Generalization and Robust Overfitting (CGRO). In this work, we study the CGRO phenomenon in adversarial training from two views: representation complexity and training dynamics. Specifically, we consider a binary classification setting with $N$ separated training data points. First, we prove that, based on the assumption that we assume there is $\operatorname{poly}(D)$-size clean classifier (where $D$ is the data dimension), ReLU net with only $O(N D)$ extra parameters is able to leverages robust memorization to achieve the CGRO, while robust classifier still requires exponential representation complexity in worst case. Next, we focus on a structured-data case to analyze training dynamics, where we train a two-layer convolutional network with $O(N D)$ width against adversarial perturbation. We then show that a three-stage phase transition occurs during learning process and the network provably converges to robust memorization regime, which thereby results in the CGRO. Besides, we also empirically verify our theoretical analysis by experiments in real-image recognition datasets.

Abstract: Over the past decade, deep learning has proven to be a highly effective tool for learning meaningful features from raw data. However, it remains an open question how deep networks perform hierarchical feature learning across layers. In this work, we attempt to unveil this mystery by investigating the structures of intermediate features. Motivated by our empirical findings that linear layers mimic the roles of deep layers in nonlinear networks for feature learning, we explore how deep linear networks transform input data into output by investigating the output (i.e., features) of each layer after training in the context of multi-class classification problems. Toward this goal, we first define metrics to measure within-class compression and between-class discrimination of intermediate features, respectively. Through theoretical analysis of these two metrics, we show that the evolution of features follows a simple and quantitative pattern from shallow to deep layers when the input data is nearly orthogonal and the network weights are minimum-norm, balanced, and approximate low-rank: Each layer of the linear network progressively compresses within-class features at a geometric rate and discriminates between-class features at a linear rate with respect to the number of layers that data have passed through. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative characterization of feature evolution in hierarchical representations of deep linear networks. Empirically, our extensive experiments not only validate our theoretical results numerically but also reveal a similar pattern in deep nonlinear networks which aligns well with recent empirical studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical implications of our results in transfer learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Heimine/PNC_DLN.

Abstract: While it is important to make implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMI) wireless to increase patient comfort and safety, the trend of increased channel count in recent neural probes poses a challenge due to the concomitant increase in the data rate. Extracting information from raw data at the source by using edge computing is a promising solution to this problem, with integrated intention decoders providing the best compression ratio. Recent benchmarking efforts have shown recurrent neural networks to be the best solution. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) emerge as a promising solution for resource efficient neural decoding while Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks achieve the best accuracy. In this work, we show that combining traditional signal processing techniques, namely signal filtering, with SNNs improve their decoding performance significantly for regression tasks, closing the gap with LSTMs, at little added cost. Results with different filters are shown with Bessel filters providing best performance. Two block-bidirectional Bessel filters have been used--one for low latency and another for high accuracy. Adding the high accuracy variant of the Bessel filters to the output of ANN, SNN and variants provided statistically significant benefits with maximum gains of $\approx 5\%$ and $8\%$ in $R^2$ for two SNN topologies (SNN\_Streaming and SNN\_3D). Our work presents state of the art results for this dataset and paves the way for decoder-integrated-implants of the future.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in diffusion models, gaining a deep understanding of the model class remains an elusive endeavour, particularly for the uninitiated in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Thanks to the rapid rate of progress in the field, most existing work on diffusion models focuses on either applications or theoretical contributions. Unfortunately, the theoretical material is often inaccessible to practitioners and new researchers, leading to a risk of superficial understanding in ongoing research. Given that diffusion models are now an indispensable tool, a clear and consolidating perspective on the model class is needed to properly contextualize recent advances in generative modelling and lower the barrier to entry for new researchers. To that end, we revisit predecessors to diffusion models like hierarchical latent variable models and synthesize a holistic perspective using only directed graphical modelling and variational inference principles. The resulting narrative is easier to follow as it imposes fewer prerequisites on the average reader relative to the view from non-equilibrium thermodynamics or stochastic differential equations.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling graph-structured data, like other machine learning models, GNNs are also susceptible to making biased predictions based on sensitive attributes, such as race and gender. For fairness consideration, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods propose to filter out sensitive information from inputs or representations, e.g., edge dropping or feature masking. However, we argue that such filtering-based strategies may also filter out some non-sensitive feature information, leading to a sub-optimal trade-off between predictive performance and fairness. To address this issue, we unveil an innovative neutralization-based paradigm, where additional Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) are incorporated into node features or representations before message passing. The F3 are expected to statistically neutralize the sensitive bias in node representations and provide additional nonsensitive information. We also provide theoretical explanations for our rationale, concluding that F3 can be realized by emphasizing the features of each node's heterogeneous neighbors (neighbors with different sensitive attributes). We name our method as FairSIN, and present three implementation variants from both data-centric and model-centric perspectives. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets with three different GNN backbones show that FairSIN significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining high prediction accuracies.

Abstract: Fully decentralised federated learning enables collaborative training of individual machine learning models on a distributed network of communicating devices while keeping the training data localised on each node. This approach avoids central coordination, enhances data privacy and eliminates the risk of a single point of failure. Our research highlights that the effectiveness of decentralised federated learning is significantly influenced by the network topology of connected devices and the learning models' initial conditions. We propose a strategy for uncoordinated initialisation of the artificial neural networks based on the distribution of eigenvector centralities of the underlying communication network, leading to a radically improved training efficiency. Additionally, our study explores the scaling behaviour and the choice of environmental parameters under our proposed initialisation strategy. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable artificial neural network training in a distributed and uncoordinated environment, offering a deeper understanding of the intertwining roles of network structure and learning dynamics.

Specifically, if $d$ denotes the dimension of the weights and $k$ the number of iterations, then the error of the weights is bounded by $O(k^{-1/(d-1)})$, leading to slow convergence as $d$ increases.We propose a projected subgradient method with a step size of $k^{-1/2}$ based on suboptimality loss. We theoretically show and demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently learns the weights. In particular, we show that there exists a constant $\gamma > 0$ such that the distance between the learned and true weights is bounded by $ O\left(k^{-1/(1+\gamma)} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma k^{1/2}}{2+\gamma}\right)\right), $ or the optimal solution is exactly recovered. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method solves the inverse optimization problems of MILP using fewer than $1/7$ the number of MILP calls required by known methods, and converges within a finite number of iterations.

<title>How Well Can a Long Sequence Model Model Long Sequences? Comparing Architechtural Inductive Biases on Long-Context Abilities</title>

Abstract: Long sequences occur in abundance within real-world scenarios, hence properly modelling them opens numerous down-stream use-cases. Deep neural networks, however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed. In particular, recurrent models still suffer in the same settings as long-context LLMs with attention. We further show that different inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.

Abstract: Seaports play a crucial role in the global economy, and researchers have sought to understand their significance through various studies. In this paper, we aim to explore the common characteristics shared by important ports by analyzing the network of connections formed by vessel movement among them. To accomplish this task, we adopt a bottom-up network construction approach that combines three years' worth of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data from around the world, constructing a Ports Network that represents the connections between different ports. Through this representation, we utilize machine learning to assess the relative significance of various port features. Our model examined such features and revealed that geographical characteristics and the port's depth are indicators of a port's importance to the Ports Network. Accordingly, this study employs a data-driven approach and utilizes machine learning to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to the extent of ports. Our work aims to inform decision-making processes related to port development, resource allocation, and infrastructure planning within the industry.

Abstract: The safe deployment of machine learning and AI models in open-world settings hinges critically on the ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data accurately, data samples that contrast vastly from what the model was trained with. Current approaches to OOD detection often require further training the model, and/or statistics about the training data which may no longer be accessible. Additionally, many existing OOD detection methods struggle to maintain performance when transferred across different architectures. Our research tackles these issues by proposing a simple, post-hoc method that does not require access to the training data distribution, keeps a trained network intact, and holds strong performance across a variety of architectures. Our method, Logit Scaling (LTS), as the name suggests, simply scales the logits in a manner that effectively distinguishes between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. We tested our method on benchmarks across various scales, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and OpenOOD. The experiments cover 3 ID and 14 OOD datasets, as well as 9 model architectures. Overall, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, robustness and adaptability across different architectures, paving the way towards a universally applicable solution for advanced OOD detection.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithm design automatically adapts algorithms to specific application domains, achieving better performance. In the context of parameterized algorithms, this approach involves tuning the algorithm's hyperparameters using problem instances drawn from the problem distribution of the target application domain. This can be achieved by maximizing empirical utilities that measure the algorithms' performance as a function of their hyperparameters, using problem instances. While empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of data-driven algorithm design, providing theoretical guarantees for several parameterized families remains challenging. This is due to the intricate behaviors of their corresponding utility functions, which typically admit piecewise discontinuous structures. In this work, we present refined frameworks for providing learning guarantees for parameterized data-driven algorithm design problems in both distributional and online learning settings. For the distributional learning setting, we introduce the \textit{Pfaffian GJ framework}, an extension of the classical \textit{GJ framework}, that is capable of providing learning guarantees for function classes for which the computation involves Pfaffian functions. Unlike the GJ framework, which is limited to function classes with computation characterized by rational functions, our proposed framework can deal with function classes involving Pfaffian functions, which are much more general and widely applicable. We then show that for many parameterized algorithms of interest, their utility function possesses a \textit{refined piecewise structure}, which automatically translates to learning guarantees using our proposed framework.

Abstract: Generative models are capable of producing human-expert level content across a variety of topics and domains. As the impact of generative models grows, it is necessary to develop statistical methods to understand collections of available models. These methods are particularly important in settings where the user may not have access to information related to a model's pre-training data, weights, or other relevant model-level covariates. In this paper we extend recent results on representations of black-box generative models to model-level statistical inference tasks. We demonstrate that the model-level representations are effective for multiple inference tasks.

Abstract: Model fairness is becoming important in class-incremental learning for Trustworthy AI. While accuracy has been a central focus in class-incremental learning, fairness has been relatively understudied. However, naively using all the samples of the current task for training results in unfair catastrophic forgetting for certain sensitive groups including classes. We theoretically analyze that forgetting occurs if the average gradient vector of the current task data is in an "opposite direction" compared to the average gradient vector of a sensitive group, which means their inner products are negative. We then propose a fair class-incremental learning framework that adjusts the training weights of current task samples to change the direction of the average gradient vector and thus reduce the forgetting of underperforming groups and achieve fairness. For various group fairness measures, we formulate optimization problems to minimize the overall losses of sensitive groups while minimizing the disparities among them. We also show the problems can be solved with linear programming and propose an efficient Fairness-aware Sample Weighting (FSW) algorithm. Experiments show that FSW achieves better accuracy-fairness tradeoff results than state-of-the-art approaches on real datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming commodity components of larger software systems. This poses natural security and privacy problems: poisoned data retrieved from one component can change the model's behavior and compromise the entire system, including coercing the model to spread confidential data to untrusted components. One promising approach is to tackle this problem at the system level via dynamic information flow (aka taint) tracking. Unfortunately, this approach of propagating the most restrictive input label to the output is too conservative for applications where LLMs operate on inputs retrieved from diverse sources. In this paper, we propose a novel, more permissive approach to propagate information flow labels through LLM queries. The key idea behind our approach is to propagate only the labels of the samples that were influential in generating the model output and to eliminate the labels of unnecessary inputs. We implement and investigate the effectiveness of two variations of this approach, based on (i) prompt-based retrieval augmentation, and (ii) a $k$-nearest-neighbors language model. We compare these with a baseline that uses introspection to predict the output label. Our experimental results in an LLM agent setting show that the permissive label propagator improves over the baseline in more than 85% of the cases, which underscores the practicality of our approach.

Abstract: MLLM agents demonstrate potential for complex embodied tasks by retrieving multimodal task-relevant trajectory data. However, current retrieval methods primarily focus on surface-level similarities of textual or visual cues in trajectories, neglecting their effectiveness for the specific task at hand. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, MLLM As ReTriever (MART), which enhances the performance of embodied agents by utilizing interaction data to fine-tune an MLLM retriever based on preference learning, such that the retriever fully considers the effectiveness of trajectories and prioritizes them for unseen tasks. We also introduce Trajectory Abstraction, a mechanism that leverages MLLMs' summarization capabilities to represent trajectories with fewer tokens while preserving key information, enabling agents to better comprehend milestones in the trajectory. Experimental results across various environments demonstrate our method significantly improves task success rates in unseen scenes compared to baseline methods. This work presents a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval in embodied agents, by fine-tuning a general-purpose MLLM as the retriever to assess trajectory effectiveness. All the code for benchmark tasks, simulator modifications, and the MLLM retriever is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/MART.

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer (ZSPT) setting for contextual Markov decision processes (MDP), agents train on a fixed set of contexts and must generalise to new ones. Recent work has argued and demonstrated that increased exploration can improve this generalisation, by training on more states in the training contexts. In this paper, we demonstrate that training on more states can indeed improve generalisation, but can come at a cost of reducing the accuracy of the learned value function which should not benefit generalisation. We hypothesise and demonstrate that using exploration to increase the agent's coverage while also increasing the accuracy improves generalisation even more. Inspired by this, we propose a method Explore-Go that implements an exploration phase at the beginning of each episode, which can be combined with existing on- and off-policy RL algorithms and significantly improves generalisation even in partially observable MDPs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Explore-Go when combined with several popular algorithms and show an increase in generalisation performance across several environments. With this, we hope to provide practitioners with a simple modification that can improve the generalisation of their agents.

<title>Robust Offline Imitation Learning from Diverse Auxiliary Data</title>

Abstract: Offline imitation learning enables learning a policy solely from a set of expert demonstrations, without any environment interaction. To alleviate the issue of distribution shift arising due to the small amount of expert data, recent works incorporate large numbers of auxiliary demonstrations alongside the expert data. However, the performance of these approaches rely on assumptions about the quality and composition of the auxiliary data, and they are rarely successful when those assumptions do not hold. To address this limitation, we propose Robust Offline Imitation from Diverse Auxiliary Data (ROIDA). ROIDA first identifies high-quality transitions from the entire auxiliary dataset using a learned reward function. These high-reward samples are combined with the expert demonstrations for weighted behavioral cloning. For lower-quality samples, ROIDA applies temporal difference learning to steer the policy towards high-reward states, improving long-term returns. This two-pronged approach enables our framework to effectively leverage both high and low-quality data without any assumptions. Extensive experiments validate that ROIDA achieves robust and consistent performance across multiple auxiliary datasets with diverse ratios of expert and non-expert demonstrations. ROIDA effectively leverages unlabeled auxiliary data, outperforming prior methods reliant on specific data assumptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/uditaghosh/roida.

Abstract: Real-world time series inference requires more than point forecasting. It demands multi-step reasoning, constraint handling, domain knowledge incorporation, and domain-specific workflow assembly. Existing time series foundation models are limited to narrow tasks and lack flexibility to generalize across diverse scenarios. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) struggle with numerical precision. To address these limitations, we introduce TS-Reasoner, a Domain-Oriented Time Series Agent that integrates natural language reasoning with precise numerical execution. TS-Reasoner decomposes natural language instructions into structured workflows composed of statistical, logical, and domain-specific operators, and incorporates a self-refinement mechanism for adaptive execution. We evaluate its capabilities through two axes: basic time series understanding and complex multi-step inference, using the TimeSeriesExam benchmark and a newly constructed dataset. Experimental results show that TS-Reasoner significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs, highlighting the promise of domain-specialized agents for robust and interpretable time series reasoning.

<title>The Epochal Sawtooth Effect: Unveiling Training Loss Oscillations in Adam and Other Optimizers</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we identify and analyze a recurring training loss pattern, which we term the \textit{Epochal Sawtooth Effect (ESE)}, commonly observed during training with adaptive gradient-based optimizers, particularly Adam optimizer. This pattern is characterized by a sharp drop in loss at the beginning of each epoch, followed by a gradual increase, resulting in a sawtooth-shaped loss curve. Through empirical observations, we demonstrate that while this effect is most pronounced with Adam, it persists, although less severely, with other optimizers such as RMSProp.
  We provide an in-depth explanation of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the Epochal Sawtooth Effect. The influences of factors like $\beta$, batch size, data shuffling on this pattern have been studied. We quantify the influence of $beta_2$ on the shape of the loss curve, showing that higher values of $\beta_2$ result in a nearly linear increase in loss, while lower values create a concave upward trend. Our analysis reveals that this behavior stems from the adaptive learning rate controlled by the second moment estimate, with $\beta_1$ playing a minimal role when $\beta_2$ is large.
  To support our analysis, we replicate this phenomenon through a controlled quadratic minimization task. By incrementally solving a series of quadratic optimization problems using Adam, we demonstrate that the Epochal Sawtooth Effect can emerge even in simple optimization scenarios, reinforcing the generality of this pattern. This paper provides both theoretical insights and quantitative analysis, offering a comprehensive understanding of this ubiquitous phenomenon in modern optimization techniques.

Abstract: Prominent Large Language Model (LLM) services from providers like OpenAI and Google excel at general tasks but often underperform on domain-specific applications. Current customization services for these LLMs typically require users to upload data for fine-tuning, posing significant privacy risks. While differentially private (DP) data synthesis presents a potential alternative, its application commonly results in low effectiveness due to the introduction of excessive noise on data for DP. To overcome this, we introduce Llamdex, a novel framework that facilitates LLM customization as a service, where the client uploads pre-trained domain-specific models rather than data. This client-uploaded model, optionally protected by DP with much lower noise, is inserted into the base LLM via connection modules. Significantly, these connecting modules are trained without requiring sensitive domain data, enabling clients to customize LLM services while preserving data privacy. Experiments demonstrate that Llamdex improves domain-specific accuracy by up to 26\% over state-of-the-art private data synthesis methods under identical privacy constraints and, by obviating the need for users to provide domain context within queries, maintains inference efficiency comparable to the original LLM service.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models benefit from large datasets. Collecting data in biomedical domains is costly and challenging, hence, combining datasets has become a common practice. However, datasets obtained under different conditions could present undesired site-specific variability. Data harmonization methods aim to remove site-specific variance while retaining biologically relevant information. This study evaluates the effectiveness of popularly used ComBat-based methods for harmonizing data in scenarios where the class balance is not equal across sites. We find that these methods struggle with data leakage issues. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach PrettYharmonize, designed to harmonize data by pretending the target labels. We validate our approach using controlled datasets designed to benchmark the utility of harmonization. Finally, using real-world MRI and clinical data, we compare leakage-prone methods with PrettYharmonize and show that it achieves comparable performance while avoiding data leakage, particularly in site-target-dependence scenarios.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) underpins real-time monitoring in cloud services and web systems, allowing rapid identification of anomalies to prevent costly failures. Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.

Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.

Abstract: The goal of continual learning (CL) is to retain knowledge across tasks, but this conflicts with strict privacy required for sensitive training data that prevents storing or memorising individual samples. To address that, we combine CL and differential privacy (DP). We highlight that failing to account for privacy leakage through the set of labels a model can output can break the privacy of otherwise valid DP algorithms. This is especially relevant in CL. We show that mitigating the issue with a data-independent overly large label space can have minimal negative impact on utility when fine-tuning a pre-trained model under DP, while learning the labels with a separate DP mechanism risks losing small classes.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as powerful generative models for various tasks, including image, video, and speech synthesis. However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.

Abstract: In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.

Abstract: Adaptability to specialised or homogeneous behaviours is critical in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Parameter sharing (PS) techniques, common for efficient adaptation, often limit behavioural diversity due to cross-agent gradient interference, which we show can be exacerbated by the coupling of observations and agent IDs. Current remedies typically add complexity through altered objectives, manual preset diversity levels, or sequential updates. We ask: can shared policies adapt without these complexities? We propose HyperMARL, a PS approach using hypernetworks for dynamic agent-specific parameters, without altering the RL objective or requiring preset diversity levels. HyperMARL's explicit decoupling of observation- and agent-conditioned gradients empirically reduces policy gradient variance, facilitates shared-policy adaptation (including specialisation), and helps mitigate cross-agent interference. Across diverse MARL benchmarks (up to 20 agents), requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours, HyperMARL achieves competitive performance against key baselines -- fully shared, non-parameter sharing, and three diversity-promoting methods -- while preserving behavioural diversity comparable to non-parameter sharing. These findings establish HyperMARL as a versatile approach for adaptive MARL. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/KaleabTessera/HyperMARL.

<title>Extractive Structures Learned in Pretraining Enable Generalization on Finetuned Facts</title>

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) can generalize to implications of facts that they are finetuned on. For example, if finetuned on ``John Doe lives in Tokyo," LMs can correctly answer ``What language do the people in John Doe's city speak?'' with ``Japanese''. However, little is known about the mechanisms that enable this generalization or how they are learned during pretraining. We introduce extractive structures as a framework for describing how components in LMs (e.g., MLPs or attention heads) coordinate to enable this generalization. The structures consist of informative components that store training facts as weight changes, and upstream and downstream extractive components that query and process the stored information to produce the correct implication. We hypothesize that extractive structures are learned during pretraining when encountering implications of previously known facts. This yields two predictions: a data ordering effect where extractive structures can be learned only if facts precede their implications, and a weight grafting effect where extractive structures can be transferred to predict counterfactual implications. We empirically demonstrate these phenomena in the OLMo-7b, Llama 3-8b, Gemma 2-9b, and Qwen 2-7b models. Of independent interest, our results also indicate that fact learning can occur at both early and late layers, which lead to different forms of generalization.

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on heterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating practical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a benchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose the CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance metrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS Utilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems across diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit hierarchical structures in both modes: samples and features. Yet, most existing approaches for hierarchical representation learning consider only one mode at a time. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method for jointly learning hierarchical representations of samples and features via Tree-Wasserstein Distance (TWD). Our method alternates between the two data modes. It first constructs a tree for one mode, then computes a TWD for the other mode based on that tree, and finally uses the resulting TWD to build the second mode's tree. By repeatedly alternating through these steps, the method gradually refines both trees and the corresponding TWDs, capturing meaningful hierarchical representations of the data. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our method converges. We show that our method can be integrated into hyperbolic graph convolutional networks as a pre-processing technique, improving performance in link prediction and node classification tasks. In addition, our method outperforms baselines in sparse approximation and unsupervised Wasserstein distance learning tasks on word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.

Abstract: Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (Asynchronous SGD) is a cornerstone method for parallelizing learning in distributed machine learning. However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by Tyurin & Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.

Abstract: We study an online learning problem on dynamic pricing and resource allocation, where we make joint pricing and inventory decisions to maximize the overall net profit. We consider the stochastic dependence of demands on the price, which complicates the resource allocation process and introduces significant non-convexity and non-smoothness to the problem. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient algorithm that utilizes a "Lower-Confidence Bound (LCB)" meta-strategy over multiple OCO agents. Our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{Tmn})$ regret (for $m$ suppliers and $n$ consumers), which is optimal with respect to the time horizon $T$. Our results illustrate an effective integration of statistical learning methodologies with complex operations research problems.

Abstract: Diffusion models, while powerful, can inadvertently generate harmful or undesirable content, raising significant ethical and safety concerns. Recent machine unlearning approaches offer potential solutions but often lack transparency, making it difficult to understand the changes they introduce to the base model. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to remove unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a feature selection method that enables precise interventions on model activations to block targeted content while preserving overall performance. Our evaluation shows that SAeUron outperforms existing approaches on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark for concepts and style unlearning, and effectively eliminates nudity when evaluated with I2P. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron mitigates the possibility of generating unwanted content under adversarial attack. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cywinski/SAeUron.

Abstract: Asynchronous methods are fundamental for parallelizing computations in distributed machine learning. They aim to accelerate training by fully utilizing all available resources. However, their greedy approach can lead to inefficiencies using more computation than required, especially when computation times vary across devices. If the computation times were known in advance, training could be fast and resource-efficient by assigning more tasks to faster workers. The challenge lies in achieving this optimal allocation without prior knowledge of the computation time distributions. In this paper, we propose ATA (Adaptive Task Allocation), a method that adapts to heterogeneous and random distributions of worker computation times. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we show that ATA identifies the optimal task allocation and performs comparably to methods with prior knowledge of computation times. Experimental results further demonstrate that ATA is resource-efficient, significantly reducing costs compared to the greedy approach, which can be arbitrarily expensive depending on the number of workers.

Abstract: Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost--driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations--restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network, that incorporates adaptive SParsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70%. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact. Our code can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/SPHNet.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student-weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\dim(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Our analysis further casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported by experiments on synthetic regression problems, as well as real vision and NLP tasks.

Abstract: The predominant approach for training web navigation agents is to gather human demonstrations for a set of popular websites and hand-written tasks, but it is becoming clear that human data is an inefficient resource. We develop a pipeline to facilitate internet-scale training for agents without laborious human annotations. In the first stage, an LLM annotates 150k sites with agentic tasks. In the next stage, LLM agents complete tasks and produce trajectories. In the final stage, an LLM filters trajectories by judging their success. Language models are powerful data curation tools, identifying harmful content with an accuracy of 97%, judging successful trajectories with an accuracy of 82.6%, and producing effective data. We train agents based on Qwen 3 1.7B that are competitive with frontier LLMs as web agents, while being smaller and faster. Our top agent reaches a success rate of 56.9%, outperforming the data collection policy Qwen 3 235B, a 235 times larger Llama 4 Maverick, and reaching 94.7% of the performance of Gemini 2.5 Flash. We are releasing code, models and data at: https://data-for-agents.github.io.

Abstract: Motivation: Proteins are of great significance in living organisms. However, understanding their functions encounters numerous challenges, such as insufficient integration of multimodal information, a large number of training parameters, limited flexibility of classification-based methods, and the lack of systematic evaluation metrics for protein Q&amp;A systems. To tackle these issues, we propose the Prot2Chat framework. Results: We modified ProteinMPNN to encode protein sequence and structural information in a unified way. We used a large language model (LLM) to encode questions into vectors and developed a protein-text adapter to compress protein information into virtual tokens based on these vectors, achieving the early fusion of text and protein information. Finally, the same LLM reads the virtual tokens and the questions to generate answers. To optimize training efficiency, we froze the encoder and employed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques for the LLM. Experiments on two datasets show that both automated metrics and expert evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our model, and zero-shot prediction results highlight its generalization ability.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been much interest in understanding the generalization behavior of interpolating predictors, which overfit on noisy training data. Whereas standard analyses are concerned with whether a method is consistent or not, recent observations have shown that even inconsistent predictors can generalize well. In this work, we revisit the classic interpolating Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator (also known as Shepard's method), and study its generalization capabilities through this modern viewpoint. In particular, by varying a single bandwidth-like hyperparameter, we prove the existence of multiple overfitting behaviors, ranging non-monotonically from catastrophic, through benign, to tempered. Our results highlight how even classical interpolating methods can exhibit intricate generalization behaviors. In addition, for the purpose of tuning the hyperparameter, the results suggest that over-estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data is less harmful than under-estimating it. Numerical experiments complement our theory, demonstrating the same phenomena.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, but sample efficiency remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. Recently, CrossQ has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data (UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics, which are emphasized by higher UTD ratios. To address these, we integrate weight normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training, has been shown to prevent potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios, achieving competitive performance across 25 challenging continuous control tasks on the DeepMind Control Suite and Myosuite benchmarks, notably the complex dog and humanoid environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as network resets, and offers a simple yet robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely adopted technique in diffusion and flow-based generative models, enabling high-quality conditional generation. A key theoretical challenge is characterizing the distribution induced by CFG, particularly in high-dimensional settings relevant to real-world data. Previous works have shown that CFG modifies the target distribution, steering it towards a distribution sharper than the target one, more shifted towards the boundary of the class. In this work, we provide a high-dimensional analysis of CFG, showing that these distortions vanish as the data dimension grows. We present a blessing-of-dimensionality result demonstrating that in sufficiently high and infinite dimensions, CFG accurately reproduces the target distribution. Using our high-dimensional theory, we show that there is a large family of guidances enjoying this property, in particular non-linear CFG generalizations. We study a simple non-linear power-law version, for which we demonstrate improved robustness, sample fidelity and diversity. Our findings are validated with experiments on class-conditional and text-to-image generation using state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-matching models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization is a common problem that expects the model to perform well in the different distributions even far from the train data. A popular approach to addressing this issue is invariant learning (IL), in which the model is compiled to focus on invariant features instead of spurious features by adding strong constraints during training. However, there are some potential pitfalls of strong invariant constraints. Due to the limited number of diverse environments and over-regularization in the feature space, it may lead to a loss of important details in the invariant features while alleviating the spurious correlations, namely the over-invariance, which can also degrade the generalization performance. We theoretically define the over-invariance and observe that this issue occurs in various classic IL methods. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple approach Diverse Invariant Learning (DivIL) by adding the unsupervised contrastive learning and the random masking mechanism compensatory for the invariant constraints, which can be applied to various IL methods. Furthermore, we conduct experiments across multiple modalities across 12 datasets and 6 classic models, verifying our over-invariance insight and the effectiveness of our DivIL framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/kokolerk/DivIL.

We empirically demonstrate that this training recipe also scales well with more compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute cost. We hope these insights will make SLM training and research more accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, our results far outperform predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM feasibility.

Abstract: A tenet of reinforcement learning is that the agent always observes rewards. However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer may not always be available to provide rewards, sensors may be limited or malfunctioning, or rewards may be inaccessible during deployment. Monitored Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed to model such settings. However, existing Mon-MDP algorithms have several limitations: they do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot leverage a known monitor, lack worst-case guarantees for 'unsolvable' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm employs two instances of model-based interval estimation: one to ensure that observable rewards are reliably captured, and another to learn the minimax-optimal policy. Second, we empirically demonstrate the advantages. We show faster convergence than prior algorithms in over four dozen benchmarks, and even more dramatic improvement when the monitoring process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance. We show convergence to a minimax-optimal policy even when some rewards are never observable.

Abstract: We address the neural network robustness problem by adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training)-awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution-awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary)-awareness of the softmax function. The resulting SDM activation function provides strong signals of the relative epistemic (reducible) predictive uncertainty. We use this novel behavior to further address the complementary HCI problem of mapping the output to human-interpretable summary statistics over relevant partitions of a held-out calibration set. Estimates of prediction-conditional uncertainty are obtained via a parsimonious learned transform over the class-conditional empirical CDFs of the output of a final-layer SDM activation function. For decision-making and as an intrinsic model check, estimates of class-conditional accuracy are obtained by further partitioning the high-probability regions of this calibrated output into class-conditional, region-specific CDFs. The uncertainty estimates from SDM calibration are remarkably robust to test-time distribution shifts and out-of-distribution inputs; incorporate awareness of the effective sample size; provide estimates of uncertainty from the learning and data splitting processes; and are well-suited for selective classification and conditional branching for additional test-time compute based on the predictive uncertainty, as for selective LLM generation, routing, and composition over multiple models and retrieval. Finally, we construct SDM networks, LLMs with uncertainty-aware verification and interpretability-by-exemplar as intrinsic properties. We provide open-source software implementing these results.

Abstract: Part of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when a token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, a method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in a principled way and that is derived from a discrete diffusion model with a custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with a form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion. We provide the code along with a blog post on the project page: https://remdm.github.io

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in discrete-state spaces using discrete diffusion models. While posterior sampling methods for continuous diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, analogous methods for discrete diffusion models remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a principled plug-and-play discrete diffusion posterior sampling algorithm based on split Gibbs sampling, which we call SGDD. Our algorithm enables reward-guided generation and solving inverse problems in discrete-state spaces. We demonstrate the convergence of SGDD to the target posterior distribution and verify this through controlled experiments on synthetic benchmarks. Our method enjoys state-of-the-art posterior sampling performance on a range of benchmarks for discrete data, including DNA sequence design, discrete image inverse problems, and music infilling, achieving more than 30% improved performance compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: We present the POPGym Arcade, a collection of hardware-accelerated, pixel-based environments with shared observation and action spaces. Each environment includes fully and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on partial observability. We also introduce mathematical tools for analyzing policies under partial observability, which reveal how agents recall past information to make decisions. Our analysis shows (1) that controlling for partial observability is critical and (2) that agents with long-term memory learn brittle policies that struggle to generalize. Finally, we demonstrate that recurrent policies can be "poisoned" by old, out-of-distribution observations, with implications for sim-to-real transfer, imitation learning, and offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs pose a significant concern to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.

<title>Transformers for molecular property prediction: Domain adaptation efficiently improves performance</title>

Abstract: Over the past six years, molecular transformer models have become key tools in drug discovery. Most existing models are pre-trained on large, unlabeled datasets such as ZINC or ChEMBL. However, the extent to which large-scale pre-training improves molecular property prediction remains unclear. This study evaluates transformer models for this task while addressing their limitations. We explore how pre-training dataset size and chemically informed objectives impact performance. Our results show that increasing the dataset beyond approximately 400K to 800K molecules from large-scale unlabeled databases does not enhance performance across seven datasets covering five ADME endpoints: lipophilicity, permeability, solubility (two datasets), microsomal stability (two datasets), and plasma protein binding. In contrast, domain adaptation on a small, domain-specific dataset (less than or equal 4K molecules) using multi-task regression of physicochemical properties significantly boosts performance (P-value less than 0.001). A model pre-trained on 400K molecules and adapted with domain-specific data outperforms larger models such as MolFormer and performs comparably to MolBERT. Benchmarks against Random Forest (RF) baselines using descriptors and Morgan fingerprints show that chemically and physically informed features consistently yield better performance across model types. While RF remains a strong baseline, we identify concrete practices to enhance transformer performance. Aligning pre-training and adaptation with chemically meaningful tasks and domain-relevant data presents a promising direction for molecular property prediction. Our models are available on HuggingFace for easy use and adaptation.

Abstract: Diffusion models are the standard toolkit for generative modelling of 3D atomic systems. However, for different types of atomic systems -- such as molecules and materials -- the generative processes are usually highly specific to the target system despite the underlying physics being the same. We introduce the All-atom Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), a unified latent diffusion framework for jointly generating both periodic materials and non-periodic molecular systems using the same model: (1) An autoencoder maps a unified, all-atom representations of molecules and materials to a shared latent embedding space; and (2) A diffusion model is trained to generate new latent embeddings that the autoencoder can decode to sample new molecules or materials. Experiments on MP20, QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets demonstrate that jointly trained ADiT generates realistic and valid molecules as well as materials, obtaining state-of-the-art results on par with molecule and crystal-specific models. ADiT uses standard Transformers with minimal inductive biases for both the autoencoder and diffusion model, resulting in significant speedups during training and inference compared to equivariant diffusion models. Scaling ADiT up to half a billion parameters predictably improves performance, representing a step towards broadly generalizable foundation models for generative chemistry.

<title>Capacity-Aware Inference: Mitigating the Straggler Effect in Mixture of Experts</title>

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) is an effective architecture for scaling large language models by leveraging sparse expert activation, optimizing the trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, under expert parallelism, MoE suffers from inference inefficiencies due to imbalanced token-to-expert assignment, where some experts are overloaded while others remain underutilized. This imbalance leads to poor resource utilization and increased latency, as the most burdened expert dictates the overall delay, a phenomenon we define as the \textbf{\textit{Straggler Effect}}. To mitigate this, we propose Capacity-Aware Inference, including two key techniques: (1) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Drop}}, which discards overloaded tokens to regulate the maximum latency of MoE, and (2) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Reroute}}, which reallocates overflowed tokens to underutilized experts, balancing the token distribution. These techniques collectively optimize both high-load and low-load expert utilization, leading to a more efficient MoE inference pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, showing significant improvements in inference efficiency, e.g., 0.2\% average performance increase and a 1.94$\times$ inference speedup on Mixtral-8$\times$7B-Instruct.

Abstract: In mixed graphs, there are both directed and undirected edges. An extension of acyclicity to this mixed-graph setting is known as maximally ancestral graphs. This extension is of considerable interest in causal learning in the presence of confounders. There, directed edges represent a clear direction of causality, while undirected edges represent confounding. We propose a score-based branch-and-cut algorithm for learning maximally ancestral graphs. The algorithm produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods, while being faster to run on small and medium-sized synthetic instances.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are essential for building general-purpose AI assistants; however, they pose increasing safety risks. How can we ensure safety alignment of MLLMs to prevent undesired behaviors? Going further, it is critical to explore how to fine-tune MLLMs to preserve capabilities while meeting safety constraints. Fundamentally, this challenge can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem. However, existing datasets have not yet disentangled single preference signals into explicit safety constraints, hindering systematic investigation in this direction. Moreover, it remains an open question whether such constraints can be effectively incorporated into the optimization process for multi-modal models. In this work, we present the first exploration of the Safe RLHF-V -- the first multimodal safety alignment framework. The framework consists of: $\mathbf{(I)}$ BeaverTails-V, the first open-source dataset featuring dual preference annotations for helpfulness and safety, supplemented with multi-level safety labels (minor, moderate, severe); $\mathbf{(II)}$ Beaver-Guard-V, a multi-level guardrail system to proactively defend against unsafe queries and adversarial attacks. Applying the guard model over five rounds of filtering and regeneration significantly enhances the precursor model's overall safety by an average of 40.9%. $\mathbf{(III)}$ Based on dual preference, we initiate the first exploration of multi-modal safety alignment within a constrained optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Safe RLHF effectively improves both model helpfulness and safety. Specifically, Safe RLHF-V enhances model safety by 34.2% and helpfulness by 34.3%.

Abstract: Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, necessitating the development of accurate and reliable predictive models to facilitate early detection and intervention. While state of the art work has focused on various machine learning approaches for predicting heart disease, but they could not able to achieve remarkable accuracy. In response to this need, we applied nine machine learning algorithms XGBoost, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gaussian na\"ive bayes (NB gaussian), adaptive boosting, and linear regression to predict heart disease based on a range of physiological indicators. Our approach involved feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant predictors, aimed at refining the models to enhance both performance and interpretability. The models were trained, incorporating processes such as grid search hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to minimize overfitting. Additionally, we have developed a novel voting system with feature selection techniques to advance heart disease classification. Furthermore, we have evaluated the models using key performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 99% accuracy, precision, F1-Score, 98% recall, and 100% ROC AUC. This study offers a promising approach to early heart disease diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that orthonormal matrix updates speed up neural network optimization, improve training stability, and offer better hyperparameter transfer across model sizes. Applying these updates efficiently when model weights and optimizer states are sharded across a large-scale distributed LLM training system remains a major challenge. We introduce Dion (DIstributed OrthoNormalization), a scalable and communication-efficient orthonormalizing optimizer. Dion leverages low-rank approximation and decoupled momentum buffers, eliminating the need for full gradient synchronization while producing numerically equivalent results. It is compatible with simultaneous DDP, FSDP, and TP parallelism, and it computes an orthonormalized update without unsharding a full parameter matrix on any single device. We evaluate Dion on language models from 120M to 3B parameters and find that its benefits improve with increasing model size and batch size.

Abstract: Episodic tasks in Reinforcement Learning (RL) often pose challenges due to sparse reward signals and high-dimensional state spaces, which hinder efficient learning. Additionally, these tasks often feature hidden "trap states" -- irreversible failures that prevent task completion but do not provide explicit negative rewards to guide agents away from repeated errors. To address these issues, we propose Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning (TW-CRL), an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that leverages both successful and failed demonstrations. By incorporating temporal information, TW-CRL learns a dense reward function that identifies critical states associated with success or failure. This approach not only enables agents to avoid trap states but also encourages meaningful exploration beyond simple imitation of expert trajectories. Empirical evaluations on navigation tasks and robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that TW-CRL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove that the generalization error is independent of the network architecture.

Abstract: Selecting data points for model training is critical in machine learning. Effective selection methods can reduce the labeling effort, optimize on-device training for embedded systems with limited data storage, and enhance the model performance. This paper introduces a novel algorithm that uses Grad-CAM to make online decisions about retaining or discarding data points. Optimized for embedded devices, the algorithm computes a unique DRIP Score to quantify the importance of each data point. This enables dynamic decision-making on whether a data point should be stored for potential retraining or discarded without compromising model performance. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can match or even surpass the accuracy of models trained on the entire dataset, all while achieving storage savings of up to 39\%. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that makes online decisions about data point retention without requiring access to the entire dataset.

Abstract: The most widely used generative models map noise and data distributions by matching flows or scores. However, they struggle to incorporate partial observations and additional priors--something energy-based models (EBMs) handle elegantly by simply adding corresponding scalar energy terms. We address this issue by proposing Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the method's flexibility to introduce an interaction energy that supports diverse mode exploration, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein-generation setting. Our approach focuses on learning a scalar potential energy--without time-conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks--which marks a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe that this simplified framework significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling across diverse domains.

We present "Grounded in Context" - a member of Deepchecks' ORION (Output Reasoning-based InspectiON) family of lightweight evaluation models. It is our framework for hallucination detection, designed for production-scale long-context data and tailored to diverse use cases, including summarization, data extraction, and RAG. Inspired by RAG architecture, our method integrates retrieval and Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to predict factual consistency between premises and hypotheses using an encoder-based model with only a 512-token context window. Our framework identifies unsupported claims with an F1 score of 0.83 in RAGTruth's response-level classification task, matching methods that trained on the dataset, and outperforming all comparable frameworks using similar-sized models.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) installations worldwide, many being behind-the-meter systems, has significantly challenged energy management and grid operations, as unobservable PV generation further complicates the supply-demand balance. Therefore, estimating this generation from net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns and the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a promising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical and behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV disaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed PV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning (PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local and global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation model is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing local PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting a portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global level, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data centers, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed framework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method called BRACE based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.

Abstract: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with OpenAI's o3 now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP and LAB-Bench CloningScenarios. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.

Abstract: While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework that leverages fractal self-similarity to enforce global topological coherence. FractalGCL introduces two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 7%. Codes are available at (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FractalGCL-0511).

Abstract: Decision-making across various fields, such as medicine, heavily relies on conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). Practitioners commonly make decisions by checking whether the estimated CATE is positive, even though the decision-making performance of modern CATE estimators is poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we study optimal decision-making based on two-stage CATE estimators (e.g., DR-learner), which are considered state-of-the-art and widely used in practice. We prove that, while such estimators may be optimal for estimating CATE, they can be suboptimal when used for decision-making. Intuitively, this occurs because such estimators prioritize CATE accuracy in regions far away from the decision boundary, which is ultimately irrelevant to decision-making. As a remedy, we propose a novel two-stage learning objective that retargets the CATE to balance CATE estimation error and decision performance. We then propose a neural method that optimizes an adaptively-smoothed approximation of our learning objective. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of our method both empirically and theoretically. In sum, our work is the first to show how two-stage CATE estimators can be adapted for optimal decision-making.

<title>Estimate-Then-Optimize versus Integrated-Estimation-Optimization versus Sample Average Approximation: A Stochastic Dominance Perspective</title>

Abstract: In data-driven stochastic optimization, model parameters of the underlying distribution need to be estimated from data in addition to the optimization task. Recent literature considers integrating the estimation and optimization processes by selecting model parameters that lead to the best empirical objective performance. This integrated approach, which we call integrated-estimation-optimization (IEO), can be readily shown to outperform simple estimate-then-optimize (ETO) when the model is misspecified. In this paper, we show that a reverse behavior appears when the model class is well-specified and there is sufficient data. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear stochastic optimization problems, we show that simple ETO outperforms IEO asymptotically when the model class covers the ground truth, in the strong sense of stochastic dominance of the regret. Namely, the entire distribution of the regret, not only its mean or other moments, is always better for ETO compared to IEO. Our results also apply to constrained, contextual optimization problems where the decision depends on observed features. Whenever applicable, we also demonstrate how standard sample average approximation (SAA) performs the worst when the model class is well-specified in terms of regret, and best when it is misspecified. Finally, we provide experimental results to support our theoretical comparisons and illustrate when our insights hold in finite-sample regimes and under various degrees of misspecification.

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation is recognised as a key enabler in providing advanced surgical assistance and improving computer-assisted interventions. In this work, we propose SegMatch, a semi-supervised learning method to reduce the need for expensive annotation for laparoscopic and robotic surgical images. SegMatch builds on FixMatch, a widespread semi supervised classification pipeline combining consistency regularization and pseudo-labelling, and adapts it for the purpose of segmentation. In our proposed SegMatch, the unlabelled images are first weakly augmented and fed to the segmentation model to generate pseudo-labels. In parallel, images are fed to a strong augmentation branch and consistency between the branches is used as an unsupervised loss. To increase the relevance of our strong augmentations, we depart from using only handcrafted augmentations and introduce a trainable adversarial augmentation strategy. Our FixMatch adaptation for segmentation tasks further includes carefully considering the equivariance and invariance properties of the augmentation functions we rely on. For binary segmentation tasks, our algorithm was evaluated on the MICCAI Instrument Segmentation Challenge datasets, Robust-MIS 2019 and EndoVis 2017. For multi-class segmentation tasks, we relied on the recent CholecInstanceSeg dataset. Our results show that SegMatch outperforms fully-supervised approaches by incorporating unlabelled data, and surpasses a range of state-of-the-art semi-supervised models across different labelled to unlabelled data ratios.

Abstract: A plethora of next-generation all-optical devices based on exciton-polaritons have been proposed in latest years, including prototypes of transistors, switches, analogue quantum simulators and others. However, for such systems consisting of multiple polariton condensates, it is still challenging to predict their properties in a fast and accurate manner. The condensate physics is conventionally described by Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs). While GPU-based solvers currently exist, we propose a significantly more efficient machine-learning-based Fourier neural operator approach to find the solution to the GPE coupled with exciton rate equations, trained on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed method predicts solutions almost three orders of magnitude faster than CUDA-based solvers in numerical studies, maintaining the high degree of accuracy. Our method not only accelerates simulations but also opens the door to faster, more scalable designs for all-optical chips and devices, offering profound implications for quantum computing, neuromorphic systems, and beyond.

Abstract: Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (infoGAN) can be understood as a minimax problem involving two neural networks: discriminators and generators with mutual information functions. The infoGAN incorporates various components, including latent variables, mutual information, and objective function. This research demonstrates the Generalization error property of infoGAN as the discriminator and generator sample size approaches infinity. This research explores the generalization error property of InfoGAN as the sample sizes of the discriminator and generator approach infinity. To establish this property, the study considers the difference between the empirical and population versions of the objective function. The error bound is derived from the Rademacher complexity of the discriminator and generator function classes. Additionally, the bound is proven for a two-layer network, where both the discriminator and generator utilize Lipschitz and non-decreasing activation functions.

Abstract: When adapting ICL with or without fine-tuning, we are curious about whether the instruction-tuned language model is able to achieve well-calibrated results without suffering from the problem of overconfidence (i.e., miscalibration) considering its strong instruction following ability, especially in such limited data setups. In this work, we deliver an in-depth analysis of the behavior across different choices of learning methods from the perspective of both performance and calibration. Through extensive controlled experiments, we observe that the miscalibration problem exists across all learning methods in low-resource setups. To achieve simultaneous gain for both in-task performance and calibration, we then study the potential of self-ensembling applied at different modeling stages (e.g., variations of in-context examples or variations in prompts or different ensembling strategies) to make the predictions more calibrated and have comparable or even better performance. We find that self-ensembling with max probability produces robust and calibrated predictions. Our work reveals the potential calibration problem of using ICL despite the improvements in task performance and sheds light on which learning paradigm to choose. We also provide practical guidelines for choosing learning paradigms depending on whether the data has been seen by the model before and a worthwhile solution via self-ensembling on how to enhance both task performance and calibration of LMs, which we hope could encourage further study.

Abstract: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a common rebalancing strategy for handling imbalanced tabular data sets. However, few works analyze SMOTE theoretically. In this paper, we derive several non-asymptotic upper bound on SMOTE density. From these results, we prove that SMOTE (with default parameter) tends to copy the original minority samples asymptotically. We confirm and illustrate empirically this first theoretical behavior on a real-world data-set.bFurthermore, we prove that SMOTE density vanishes near the boundary of the support of the minority class distribution. We then adapt SMOTE based on our theoretical findings to introduce two new variants. These strategies are compared on 13 tabular data sets with 10 state-of-the-art rebalancing procedures, including deep generative and diffusion models. One of our key findings is that, for most data sets, applying no rebalancing strategy is competitive in terms of predictive performances, would it be with LightGBM, tuned random forests or logistic regression. However, when the imbalance ratio is artificially augmented, one of our two modifications of SMOTE leads to promising predictive performances compared to SMOTE and other state-of-the-art strategies.

Abstract: The enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism is used in current wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks to support priority requirements of heterogeneous applications. However, the EDCA mechanism can not adapt to particular quality-of-service (QoS) objective, network topology, and interference level. In this paper, a novel reinforcement-learning-based scheduling framework is proposed and implemented to optimize the application-layer quality-of-service (QoS) of a WiFi network with commercial adapters and unknown interference. Particularly, application-layer tasks of file delivery and delay-sensitive communication are jointly scheduled by adjusting the contention window sizes and application-layer throughput limitation, such that the throughput of the former and the round trip time of the latter can be optimized. Due to the unknown interference and vendor-dependent implementation of the WiFi adapters, the relation between the scheduling policy and the system QoS is unknown. Hence, a reinforcement learning method is proposed, in which a novel Q-network is trained to map from the historical scheduling parameters and QoS observations to the current scheduling action. It is demonstrated on a testbed that the proposed framework can achieve a significantly better performance than the EDCA mechanism.

<title>Causality Pursuit from Heterogeneous Environments via Neural Adversarial Invariance Learning</title>

Abstract: Pursuing causality from data is a fundamental problem in scientific discovery, treatment intervention, and transfer learning. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic method for addressing nonparametric invariance and causality learning in regression models across multiple environments, where the joint distribution of response variables and covariates varies, but the conditional expectations of outcome given an unknown set of quasi-causal variables are invariant. The challenge of finding such an unknown set of quasi-causal or invariant variables is compounded by the presence of endogenous variables that have heterogeneous effects across different environments. The proposed Focused Adversarial Invariant Regularization (FAIR) framework utilizes an innovative minimax optimization approach that drives regression models toward prediction-invariant solutions through adversarial testing. Leveraging the representation power of neural networks, FAIR neural networks (FAIR-NN) are introduced for causality pursuit. It is shown that FAIR-NN can find the invariant variables and quasi-causal variables under a minimal identification condition and that the resulting procedure is adaptive to low-dimensional composition structures in a non-asymptotic analysis. Under a structural causal model, variables identified by FAIR-NN represent pragmatic causality and provably align with exact causal mechanisms under conditions of sufficient heterogeneity. Computationally, FAIR-NN employs a novel Gumbel approximation with decreased temperature and a stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm. The procedures are demonstrated using simulated and real-data examples.

<title>Red-Teaming for Inducing Societal Bias in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the safe deployment of AI systems is critical in industry settings where biased outputs can lead to significant operational, reputational, and regulatory risks. Thorough evaluation before deployment is essential to prevent these hazards. Red-teaming addresses this need by employing adversarial attacks to develop guardrails that detect and reject biased or harmful queries, enabling models to be retrained or steered away from harmful outputs. However, most red-teaming efforts focus on harmful or unethical instructions rather than addressing social bias, leaving this critical area under-explored despite its significant real-world impact, especially in customer-facing systems. We propose two bias-specific red-teaming methods, Emotional Bias Probe (EBP) and BiasKG, to evaluate how standard safety measures for harmful content affect bias. For BiasKG, we refactor natural language stereotypes into a knowledge graph. We use these attacking strategies to induce biased responses from several open- and closed-source language models. Unlike prior work, these methods specifically target social bias. We find our method increases bias in all models, even those trained with safety guardrails. Our work emphasizes uncovering societal bias in LLMs through rigorous evaluation, and recommends measures ensure AI safety in high-stakes industry deployments.

<title>Analysis of clinical, dosimetric and radiomic features for predicting local failure after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain metastases in malignant melanoma</title>

arXiv:2405.20825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: This study aimed to predict lesion-specific outcomes after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma (MBM), using clinical, dosimetric pretherapeutic MRI data. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 517 MBM from 130 patients treated with single-fraction or hypofractionated SRT across three centers were analyzed. From contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, 1576 radiomic features (RF) were extracted per lesion - 788 from the gross tumor volume (GTV), 788 from a 3 mm peritumoral margin. Clinical data, radiation dose and RF from one center were used for feature selection and model development via nested cross-validation; external validation was performed using the other two centers. Results: Local failure occurred in 72 of 517 lesions (13.9%). Predictive models based on clinical data (model 1), RF (model 2), or both (model 3) achieved c-indices of 0.60 +/- 0.15, 0.65 +/- 0.11, and 0.65 +/- 0.12. RF-based models outperformed the clinical model, while dosimetric data alone were not predictive. Most predictive RF came from the peritumoral margin (92%) vs. GTV (76%). On the first external dataset, all models performed similarly (c-index: 0.60-0.63), but showed poor generalization on the second (c-index < 0.50), likely due to differences in patient characteristics and imaging protocols. Conclusions: Information extracted from pretherapeutic MRI, particularly from the peritumoral area, can support accurate prediction of lesion-specific outcomes after SRT in MBM. When combined with clinical data, these imaging-derived markers offer valuable prognostic insights. However, generalizability remains challenging by heterogeneity in patient populations and MRI protocols.

Abstract: We obtain a new universal approximation theorem for continuous (possibly nonlinear) operators on arbitrary Banach spaces using the Leray-Schauder mapping. Moreover, we introduce and study a method for operator learning in Banach spaces $L^p$ of functions with multiple variables, based on orthogonal projections on polynomial bases. We derive a universal approximation result for operators where we learn a linear projection and a finite dimensional mapping under some additional assumptions. For the case of $p=2$, we give some sufficient conditions for the approximation results to hold. This article serves as the theoretical framework for a deep learning methodology in operator learning.

Abstract: Bayesian bandit algorithms with approximate Bayesian inference have been widely used in real-world applications. Despite the superior practical performance, their theoretical justification is less investigated in the literature, especially for contextual bandit problems. To fill this gap, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the impact of approximate inference in stochastic linear bandits and conduct frequentist regret analysis on two Bayesian bandit algorithms, Linear Thompson Sampling (LinTS) and the extension of Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound, namely Linear Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound (LinBUCB). We demonstrate that when applied in approximate inference settings, LinTS and LinBUCB can universally preserve their original rates of regret upper bound but with a sacrifice of larger constant terms. These results hold for general Bayesian inference approaches, assuming the inference error measured by two different $\alpha$-divergences is bounded. Additionally, by introducing a new definition of well-behaved distributions, we show that LinBUCB expedites the regret rate of LinTS from $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$, matching the minimax optimal rate. To our knowledge, this work provides the first regret bounds in the setting of stochastic linear bandits with bounded approximate inference errors.

Abstract: Graphical models serve as effective tools for visualizing conditional dependencies between variables. However, as the number of variables grows, interpretation becomes increasingly difficult, and estimation uncertainty increases due to the large number of parameters relative to the number of observations. To address these challenges, we introduce the Clusterpath estimator of the Gaussian Graphical Model (CGGM) that encourages variable clustering in the graphical model in a data-driven way. Through the use of an aggregation penalty, we group variables together, which in turn results in a block-structured precision matrix whose block structure remains preserved in the covariance matrix. The CGGM estimator is formulated as the solution to a convex optimization problem, making it easy to incorporate other popular penalization schemes which we illustrate through the combination of an aggregation and sparsity penalty. We present a computationally efficient implementation of the CGGM estimator by using a cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm. In simulations, we show that CGGM not only matches, but oftentimes outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for variable clustering in graphical models. We also demonstrate CGGM's practical advantages and versatility on a diverse collection of empirical applications.

Abstract: The progress of machine learning over the past decade is undeniable. In retrospect, it is both remarkable and unsettling that this progress was achievable with little to no rigorous theory to guide experimentation. Despite this fact, practitioners have been able to guide their future experimentation via observations from previous large-scale empirical investigations. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework which attempts to provide rigor to existing practices in machine learning. To the theorist, we provide a framework which is mathematically rigorous and leaves open many interesting ideas for future exploration. To the practitioner, we provide a framework whose results are simple, and provide intuition to guide future investigations across a wide range of learning paradigms. Concretely, we provide a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory which is general enough to unify the analysis of many phenomena in machine learning. Our framework characterizes the performance of an optimal Bayesian learner as it learns from a stream of experience. Unlike existing analyses that weaken with increasing data complexity, our theoretical tools provide accurate insights across diverse machine learning settings. Throughout this work, we derive theoretical results and demonstrate their generality by apply them to derive insights specific to settings. These settings range from learning from data which is independently and identically distributed under an unknown distribution, to data which is sequential, to data which exhibits hierarchical structure amenable to meta-learning, and finally to data which is not fully explainable under the learner's beliefs (misspecification). These results are particularly relevant as we strive to understand and overcome increasingly difficult machine learning challenges in this endlessly complex world.

Abstract: Deep neural models have achieved state of the art performance on a wide range of problems in computer science, especially in computer vision. However, deep neural networks often require large datasets of labeled samples to generalize effectively, and an important area of active research is semi-supervised learning, which attempts to instead utilize large quantities of (easily acquired) unlabeled samples. One family of methods in this space is pseudo-labeling, a class of algorithms that use model outputs to assign labels to unlabeled samples which are then used as labeled samples during training. Such assigned labels, called pseudo-labels, are most commonly associated with the field of semi-supervised learning. In this work we explore a broader interpretation of pseudo-labels within both self-supervised and unsupervised methods. By drawing the connection between these areas we identify new directions when advancements in one area would likely benefit others, such as curriculum learning and self-supervised regularization.

<title>VAE-QWGAN: Addressing Mode Collapse in Quantum GANs via Autoencoding Priors</title>

Abstract: Recent proposals for quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) suffer from the issue of mode collapse, analogous to classical GANs, wherein the distribution learnt by the GAN fails to capture the high mode complexities of the target distribution. Mode collapse can arise due to the use of uninformed prior distributions in the generative learning task. To alleviate the issue of mode collapse for quantum GANs, this work presents a novel \textbf{hybrid quantum-classical generative model}, the VAE-QWGAN, which combines the strengths of a classical Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) with a hybrid Quantum Wasserstein GAN (QWGAN). The VAE-QWGAN fuses the VAE decoder and QWGAN generator into a single quantum model, and utilizes the VAE encoder for data-dependant latent vector sampling during training. This in turn, enhances the diversity and quality of generated images. To generate new data from the trained model at inference, we sample from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior that is learnt on the latent vectors generated during training. We conduct extensive experiments for image generation QGANs on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST datasets and compute a range of metrics that measure the diversity and quality of generated samples. We show that VAE-QWGAN demonstrates significant improvement over existing QGAN approaches.

Abstract: Based on the framework of Conformal Prediction (CP), we study the online construction of confidence sets given a black-box machine learning model. By converting the target confidence levels into quantile levels, the problem can be reduced to predicting the quantiles (in hindsight) of a sequentially revealed data sequence. Two very different approaches have been studied previously: (i) Assuming the data sequence is iid or exchangeable, one could maintain the empirical distribution of the observed data as an algorithmic belief, and directly predict its quantiles. (ii) Due to the fragility of statistical assumptions, a recent trend is to consider the non-distributional, adversarial setting and apply first-order online optimization algorithms to moving quantile losses. However, it requires the oracle knowledge of the target quantile level, and suffers from a previously overlooked monotonicity issue due to the associated loss linearization.
  This paper presents an adaptive CP algorithm that combines their strengths. Without any statistical assumption, it is able to answer multiple arbitrary confidence level queries with low regret, while also overcoming the monotonicity issue suffered by first-order optimization baselines. Furthermore, if the data sequence is actually iid, then the same algorithm is automatically equipped with the "correct" coverage probability guarantee.
  To achieve such strengths, our key technical innovation is to regularize the aforementioned algorithmic belief (the empirical distribution) by a Bayesian prior, which robustifies it by simulating a non-linearized Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) algorithm on the output. Such a belief update backbone is shared by prediction heads targeting different confidence levels, bringing practical benefits analogous to the recently proposed concept of U-calibration (Kleinberg et al., 2023).

Abstract: LLM watermarks stand out as a promising way to attribute ownership of LLM-generated text. One threat to watermark credibility comes from spoofing attacks, where an unauthorized third party forges the watermark, enabling it to falsely attribute arbitrary texts to a particular LLM. Despite recent work demonstrating that state-of-the-art schemes are, in fact, vulnerable to spoofing, no prior work has focused on post-hoc methods to discover spoofing attempts. In this work, we for the first time propose a reliable statistical method to distinguish spoofed from genuinely watermarked text, suggesting that current spoofing attacks are less effective than previously thought. In particular, we show that regardless of their underlying approach, all current learning-based spoofing methods consistently leave observable artifacts in spoofed texts, indicative of watermark forgery. We build upon these findings to propose rigorous statistical tests that reliably reveal the presence of such artifacts and thus demonstrate that a watermark has been spoofed. Our experimental evaluation shows high test power across all learning-based spoofing methods, providing insights into their fundamental limitations and suggesting a way to mitigate this threat. We make all our code available at https://github.com/eth-sri/watermark-spoofing-detection .

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in economic and strategic interactions, where communication via natural language is often prevalent. This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? How do they perform compared to humans? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair outcome? What is the role of natural language in strategic interaction? How do characteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These questions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of integrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as online retail platforms and recommender systems. To answer these questions, we introduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential, language-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base families of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and economic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the game outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for interaction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional dataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the behavior of LLM-based agents in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of agents. Our results suggest that the market parameters, as well as the choice of the LLMs, tend to have complex and interdependent effects on the economic outcome, which calls for careful design and analysis of the language-based economic ecosystem.

<title>WGFormer: An SE(3)-Transformer Driven by Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Molecular Ground-State Conformation Prediction</title>

Abstract: Predicting molecular ground-state conformation (i.e., energy-minimized conformation) is crucial for many chemical applications such as molecular docking and property prediction. Classic energy-based simulation is time-consuming when solving this problem, while existing learning-based methods have advantages in computational efficiency but sacrifice accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method to bridge the energy-based simulation and the learning-based strategy, which designs and learns a Wasserstein gradient flow-driven SE(3)-Transformer, called WGFormer, for ground-state conformation prediction. Specifically, our method tackles this task within an auto-encoding framework, which encodes low-quality conformations by the proposed WGFormer and decodes corresponding ground-state conformations by an MLP. The architecture of WGFormer corresponds to Wasserstein gradient flows -- it optimizes conformations by minimizing an energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms, thereby significantly improving performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, providing a new and insightful paradigm to predict ground-state conformation.

Abstract: Graphons are continuous models that represent the structure of graphs and allow the generation of graphs of varying sizes. We propose Scalable Implicit Graphon Learning (SIGL), a scalable method that combines implicit neural representations (INRs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate a graphon from observed graphs. Unlike existing methods, which face important limitations like fixed resolution and scalability issues, SIGL learns a continuous graphon at arbitrary resolutions. GNNs are used to determine the correct node ordering, improving graph alignment. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic consistency of our estimator, showing that more expressive INRs and GNNs lead to consistent estimators. We evaluate SIGL in synthetic and real-world graphs, showing that it outperforms existing methods and scales effectively to larger graphs, making it ideal for tasks like graph data augmentation.

Abstract: The growth in prominence of large language models (LLMs) in everyday life can be largely attributed to their generative abilities, yet some of this is also owed to the risks and costs associated with their use. On one front is their tendency to hallucinate false or misleading information, limiting their reliability. On another is the increasing focus on the computational limitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has brought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to overcome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns simultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing concerns about hallucinations? Do they affect how and where they occur? Through an extensive evaluation, we study how these architecture-based inductive biases affect the propensity to hallucinate. While hallucination remains a general phenomenon not limited to specific architectures, the situations in which they occur and the ease with which specific types of hallucinations can be induced can significantly differ based on the model architecture. These findings highlight the need for better understanding both these problems in conjunction with each other, as well as consider how to design more universal techniques for handling hallucinations.

Abstract: Reliable confidence estimation is essential for enhancing the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes scenarios. Despite its importance, accurately estimating confidence in LLM responses remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose using an auxiliary learning model to assess response correctness based on the self-consistency of multiple outputs generated by the LLM. Our method builds a consistency graph to represent the agreement among multiple responses and uses a graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the likelihood that each response is correct. Experiments demonstrate that this method has strong calibration performance on various benchmark datasets and generalizes well to out-of-domain cases.

arXiv:2411.03226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been observed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) suffer from redundancy in feature maps, leading to inefficient capacity utilization. Efforts to address this issue have largely focused on kernel orthogonality method. In this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that kernel orthogonality does not necessarily lead to a reduction in feature map redundancy. Based on this analysis, we propose the Convolutional Similarity method to reduce feature map similarity, independently of the CNN's input. The Convolutional Similarity can be minimized as either a regularization term or an iterative initialization method. Experimental results show that minimizing Convolutional Similarity not only improves classification accuracy but also accelerates convergence. Furthermore, our method enables the use of significantly smaller models to achieve the same level of performance, promoting a more efficient use of model capacity. Future work will focus on coupling the iterative initialization method with the optimization momentum term and examining the method's impact on generative frameworks.

Abstract: We present TRACE (Transformer-based Risk Assessment for Clinical Evaluation), a novel method for clinical risk assessment based on clinical data, leveraging the self-attention mechanism for enhanced feature interaction and result interpretation. Our approach is able to handle different data modalities, including continuous, categorical and multiple-choice (checkbox) attributes. The proposed architecture features a shared representation of the clinical data obtained by integrating specialized embeddings of each data modality, enabling the detection of high-risk individuals using Transformer encoder layers. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, a strong baseline based on non-negative multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) is introduced. The proposed method outperforms various baselines widely used in the domain of clinical risk assessment, while effectively handling missing values. In terms of explainability, our Transformer-based method offers easily interpretable results via attention weights, further enhancing the clinicians' decision-making process.

<title>Breaking Information Cocoons: A Hyperbolic Graph-LLM Framework for Exploration and Exploitation in Recommender Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13865</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.13865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems often create information cocoons, restricting users' exposure to diverse content. A key challenge lies in balancing content exploration and exploitation while allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be modeled as a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations: Euclidean methods struggle to capture hierarchical structures, while hyperbolic methods, despite their superior hierarchical modeling, lack semantic understanding of user and item profiles and fail to provide a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. To address these challenges, we propose HERec, a hyperbolic graph-LLM framework that effectively balances exploration and exploitation in recommender systems. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a semantic-enhanced hierarchical mechanism that aligns rich textual descriptions processed by large language models (LLMs) with collaborative information directly in hyperbolic space, allowing for more nuanced updates that respect the underlying hierarchical structure in user-item profiles; (2) an automatic hierarchical representation by optimizing Dasgupta's cost, which discovers hierarchical structures without requiring predefined hyperparameters, enabling user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics, effectively mitigating information cocoons. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/Martin-qyma/HERec.

arXiv:2411.14716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces VisionPAD, a novel self-supervised pre-training paradigm designed for vision-centric algorithms in autonomous driving. In contrast to previous approaches that employ neural rendering with explicit depth supervision, VisionPAD utilizes more efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct multi-view representations using only images as supervision. Specifically, we introduce a self-supervised method for voxel velocity estimation. By warping voxels to adjacent frames and supervising the rendered outputs, the model effectively learns motion cues in the sequential data. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-frame photometric consistency approach to enhance geometric perception. It projects adjacent frames to the current frame based on rendered depths and relative poses, boosting the 3D geometric representation through pure image supervision. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that VisionPAD significantly improves performance in 3D object detection, occupancy prediction and map segmentation, surpassing state-of-the-art pre-training strategies by a considerable margin.

<title>On the Lack of Robustness of Binary Function Similarity Systems</title>

arXiv:2412.04163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary function similarity, which often relies on learning-based algorithms to identify what functions in a pool are most similar to a given query function, is a sought-after topic in different communities, including machine learning, software engineering, and security. Its importance stems from the impact it has in facilitating several crucial tasks, from reverse engineering and malware analysis to automated vulnerability detection. Whereas recent work cast light around performance on this long-studied problem, the research landscape remains largely lackluster in understanding the resiliency of the state-of-the-art machine learning models against adversarial attacks. As security requires to reason about adversaries, in this work we assess the robustness of such models through a simple yet effective black-box greedy attack, which modifies the topology and the content of the control flow of the attacked functions. We demonstrate that this attack is successful in compromising all the models, achieving average attack success rates of 57.06% and 95.81% depending on the problem settings (targeted and untargeted attacks). Our findings are insightful: top performance on clean data does not necessarily relate to top robustness properties, which explicitly highlights performance-robustness trade-offs one should consider when deploying such models, calling for further research.

<title>What Matters in Learning A Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real RL Policy for Quadrotor Control? A Comprehensive Study</title>

arXiv:2412.11764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Executing precise and agile flight maneuvers is critical for quadrotors in various applications. Traditional quadrotor control approaches are limited by their reliance on flat trajectories or time-consuming optimization, which restricts their flexibility. Recently, RL-based policy has emerged as a promising alternative due to its ability to directly map observations to actions, reducing the need for detailed system knowledge and actuation constraints. However, a significant challenge remains in bridging the sim-to-real gap, where RL-based policies often experience instability when deployed in real world. In this paper, we investigate key factors for learning robust RL-based control policies that are capable of zero-shot deployment in real-world quadrotors. We identify five critical factors and we develop a PPO-based training framework named SimpleFlight, which integrates these five techniques. We validate the efficacy of SimpleFlight on Crazyflie quadrotor, demonstrating that it achieves more than a 50% reduction in trajectory tracking error compared to state-of-the-art RL baselines. The policy derived by SimpleFlight consistently excels across both smooth polynominal trajectories and challenging infeasible zigzag trajectories on small thrust-to-weight quadrotors. In contrast, baseline methods struggle with high-speed or infeasible trajectories. To support further research and reproducibility, we integrate SimpleFlight into a GPU-based simulator Omnidrones and provide open-source access to the code and model checkpoints. We hope SimpleFlight will offer valuable insights for advancing RL-based quadrotor control. For more details, visit our project website at https://sites.google.com/view/simpleflight/.

Abstract: We introduce AKT (Advanced Knowledge Transfer), a novel method to enhance the training ability of low-bit quantized (Q) models in the field of zero-shot quantization (ZSQ). Existing research in ZSQ has focused on generating high-quality data from full-precision (FP) models. However, these approaches struggle with reduced learning ability in low-bit quantization due to its limited information capacity. To overcome this limitation, we propose effective training strategy compared to data generation. Particularly, we analyzed that refining feature maps in the feature distillation process is an effective way to transfer knowledge to the Q model. Based on this analysis, AKT efficiently transfer core information from the FP model to the Q model. AKT is the first approach to utilize both spatial and channel attention information in feature distillation in ZSQ. Our method addresses the fundamental gradient exploding problem in low-bit Q models. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the AKT. Our method led to significant performance enhancement in existing generative models. Notably, AKT achieved significant accuracy improvements in low-bit Q models, achieving state-of-the-art in the 3,5bit scenarios on CIFAR-10. The code is available at https://github.com/Inpyo-Hong/AKT-Advanced-knowledge-Transfer.

Across a variety of robotic manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that GPC consistently outperforms behavior cloning in both state-based and vision-based settings, in simulation and in the real world.

arXiv:2502.00691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.
  While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

Abstract: Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments on both simulated and real robots show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents.

Abstract: Spike sorting is an essential process in neural recording, which identifies and separates electrical signals from individual neurons recorded by electrodes in the brain, enabling researchers to study how specific neurons communicate and process information. Although there exist a number of spike sorting methods which have contributed to significant neuroscientific breakthroughs, many are heuristically designed, making it challenging to verify their correctness due to the difficulty of obtaining ground truth labels from real-world neural recordings. In this work, we explore a data-driven, deep learning-based approach. We begin by creating a large-scale dataset through electrophysiology simulations using biologically realistic computational models. We then present SimSort, a pretraining framework for spike sorting. Trained solely on simulated data, SimSort demonstrates zero-shot generalizability to real-world spike sorting tasks, yielding consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of simulation-driven pretraining to enhance the robustness and scalability of spike sorting in experimental neuroscience.

arXiv:2502.04380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains. In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this work, we investigate the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-design for LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face a fundamental challenge in aligning independently developed retrievers and large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically involve modifying either component or introducing simple intermediate modules, resulting in practical limitations and sub-optimal performance. Inspired by human search behavior -- typically involving a back-and-forth process of proposing search queries and reviewing documents, we propose C-3PO, a proxy-centric framework that facilitates communication between retrievers and LLMs through a lightweight multi-agent system. Our framework implements three specialized agents that collaboratively optimize the entire RAG pipeline without altering the retriever and LLMs. These agents work together to assess the need for retrieval, generate effective queries, and select information suitable for the LLMs. To enable effective multi-agent coordination, we develop a tree-structured rollout approach for reward credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios demonstrate that C-3PO significantly enhances RAG performance while maintaining plug-and-play flexibility and superior generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Randomized sketching accelerates large-scale numerical linear algebra by reducing computational complexity. While the traditional sketch-and-solve approach reduces the problem size directly through sketching, the sketch-and-precondition method leverages sketching to construct a computational friendly preconditioner. This preconditioner improves the convergence speed of iterative solvers applied to the original problem, maintaining accuracy in the full space. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the solver improves at least linearly with the sketch size. Despite its potential, developing a sketch-and-precondition framework for randomized algorithms in low-rank matrix approximation remains an open challenge. We introduce the Error-Powered Sketched Inverse Iteration (EPSI) Method via run sketched Newton iteration for the Lagrange form as a sketch-and-precondition variant for randomized low-rank approximation. Our method achieves theoretical guarantees, including a convergence rate that improves at least linearly with the sketch size.

Abstract: We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

Abstract: This comprehensive survey examines the integration of knowledge-based approaches in autonomous driving systems, specifically focusing on trajectory prediction and planning. We extensively analyze various methodologies for incorporating domain knowledge, traffic rules, and commonsense reasoning into autonomous driving systems. The survey categorizes and analyzes approaches based on their knowledge representation and integration methods, ranging from purely symbolic to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. We examine recent developments in logic programming, foundation models for knowledge representation, reinforcement learning frameworks, and other emerging technologies incorporating domain knowledge. This work systematically reviews recent approaches, identifying key challenges, opportunities, and future research directions in knowledge-enhanced autonomous driving systems. Our analysis reveals emerging trends in the field, including the increasing importance of interpretable AI, the role of formal verification in safety-critical systems, and the potential of hybrid approaches that combine traditional knowledge representation with modern machine learning techniques.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) perform outstandingly across various multimodal tasks. However, their ability to evaluate generated content remains limited, and training vision-language reward models (VLRMs) with preference data is computationally expensive. This paper explores a training-free alternative by merging text-based reward models (RMs) with LVLMs to create VLRMs. Our approach shows that integrating these models leads to improved performance over LVLMs' scoring and text-based RMs, offering an efficient method for incorporating textual preferences into LVLMs.

<title>CoT-ICL Lab: A Synthetic Framework for Studying Chain-of-Thought Learning from In-Context Demonstrations</title>

Abstract: We introduce CoT-ICL Lab, a framework and methodology to generate synthetic tokenized datasets and systematically study chain-of-thought (CoT) in-context learning (ICL) in language models. CoT-ICL Lab allows fine grained control over the complexity of in-context examples by decoupling (1) the causal structure involved in chain token generation from (2) the underlying token processing functions. We train decoder-only transformers (up to 700M parameters) on these datasets and show that CoT accelerates the accuracy transition to higher values across model sizes. In particular, we find that model depth is crucial for leveraging CoT with limited in-context examples, while more examples help shallow models match deeper model performance. Additionally, limiting the diversity of token processing functions throughout training improves causal structure learning via ICL. We also interpret these transitions by analyzing transformer embeddings and attention maps. Overall, CoT-ICL Lab serves as a simple yet powerful testbed for theoretical and empirical insights into ICL and CoT in language models.

<title>Finite-Sample Analysis of Policy Evaluation for Robust Average Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2502.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first finite-sample analysis for policy evaluation in robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Prior works in this setting have established only asymptotic convergence guarantees, leaving open the question of sample complexity. In this work, we address this gap by establishing that the robust Bellman operator is a contraction under the span semi-norm, and developing a stochastic approximation framework with controlled bias. Our approach builds upon Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques to estimate the robust Bellman operator efficiently. To overcome the infinite expected sample complexity inherent in standard MLMC, we introduce a truncation mechanism based on a geometric distribution, ensuring a finite constant sample complexity while maintaining a small bias that decays exponentially with the truncation level. Our method achieves the order-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for robust policy evaluation and robust average reward estimation, marking a significant advancement in robust reinforcement learning theory.

Abstract: We consider layerwise function-space learning rates, which measure the magnitude of the change in a neural network's output function in response to an update to a parameter tensor. This contrasts with traditional learning rates, which describe the magnitude of changes in parameter space. We develop efficient methods to measure and set function-space learning rates in arbitrary neural networks, requiring only minimal computational overhead through a few additional backward passes that can be performed at the start of, or periodically during, training. We demonstrate two key applications: (1) analysing the dynamics of standard neural network optimisers in function space, rather than parameter space, and (2) introducing FLeRM (Function-space Learning Rate Matching), a novel approach to hyperparameter transfer across model scales. FLeRM records function-space learning rates while training a small, cheap base model, then automatically adjusts parameter-space layerwise learning rates when training larger models to maintain consistent function-space updates. FLeRM gives hyperparameter transfer across model width, depth, initialisation scale, and LoRA rank in various architectures including MLPs with residual connections and transformers with different layer normalisation schemes.

<title>Progressive Local Alignment for Medical Multimodal Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Local alignment between medical images and text is essential for accurate diagnosis, though it remains challenging due to the absence of natural local pairings and the limitations of rigid region recognition methods. Traditional approaches rely on hard boundaries, which introduce uncertainty, whereas medical imaging demands flexible soft region recognition to handle irregular structures. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Progressive Local Alignment Network (PLAN), which designs a novel contrastive learning-based approach for local alignment to establish meaningful word-pixel relationships and introduces a progressive learning strategy to iteratively refine these relationships, enhancing alignment precision and robustness. By combining these techniques, PLAN effectively improves soft region recognition while suppressing noise interference. Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate that PLAN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in phrase grounding, image-text retrieval, object detection, and zero-shot classification, setting a new benchmark for medical image-text alignment.

arXiv:2502.19918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on prolonged reasoning chains to solve complex tasks. However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs to \enquote{think about how to think.} Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor, decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs contextual multi-armed bandits to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress and select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the position of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate more stable training owing to their stronger identity path, they often lead to suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a simple yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence demonstrating that HybridNorm improves gradient flow and model robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale transformer models, including both dense and sparse variants, show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches across multiple benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

<title>Uncertainty Distillation: Teaching Language Models to Express Semantic Confidence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.14749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for factual question-answering, it becomes more important for LLMs to have the capability to communicate the likelihood that their answer is correct. For these verbalized expressions of uncertainty to be meaningful, they should reflect the error rates at the expressed level of confidence. However, when prompted to express confidence, the error rates of current LLMs are inconsistent with their communicated confidences, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification methods. Many prior methods calculate lexical uncertainty, estimating a model's confidence in the specific string it generated. In some cases, however, it may be more useful to estimate semantic uncertainty, or the model's confidence in the answer regardless of how it is verbalized. We propose a simple procedure, uncertainty distillation, to teach an LLM to verbalize calibrated semantic confidences. Using held-out data to map initial uncertainty estimates to meaningful probabilities, we create examples annotated with verbalized probabilities for supervised fine-tuning. We compare uncertainty distillation to several strong baselines, and find that our method yields verbalized confidences that correlate well with observed error rates.

<title>Optimizing Case-Based Reasoning System for Functional Test Script Generation with Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2503.20576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating functional test scripts, which necessitates understanding the dynamically evolving code structure of the target software. To achieve this, we propose a case-based reasoning (CBR) system utilizing a 4R cycle (i.e., retrieve, reuse, revise, and retain), which maintains and leverages a case bank of test intent descriptions and corresponding test scripts to facilitate LLMs for test script generation. To improve user experience further, we introduce Re4, an optimization method for the CBR system, comprising reranking-based retrieval finetuning and reinforced reuse finetuning. Specifically, we first identify positive examples with high semantic and script similarity, providing reliable pseudo-labels for finetuning the retriever model without costly labeling. Then, we apply supervised finetuning, followed by a reinforcement learning finetuning stage, to align LLMs with our production scenarios, ensuring the faithful reuse of retrieved cases. Extensive experimental results on two product development units from Huawei Datacom demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CBR+Re4. Notably, we also show that the proposed Re4 method can help alleviate the repetitive generation issues with LLMs.

Abstract: An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

<title>Evaluating Judges as Evaluators: The JETTS Benchmark of LLM-as-Judges as Test-Time Scaling Evaluators</title>

arXiv:2504.15253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models). Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.

Abstract: This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the maj@n metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model maj@n, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities to generate novel research ideas in science, a direction which coincides with many foundational principles in computational creativity (CC). In light of these developments, we present an idea generation system named Spark that couples retrieval-augmented idea generation using LLMs with a reviewer model named Judge trained on 600K scientific reviews from OpenReview. Our work is both a system demonstration and intended to inspire other CC researchers to explore grounding the generation and evaluation of scientific ideas within foundational CC principles. To this end, we release the annotated dataset used to train Judge, inviting other researchers to explore the use of LLMs for idea generation and creative evaluations.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a distribution over a finite alphabet from an i.i.d. sample, with accuracy measured in relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability guarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace (add-one) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its performance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators. We then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk, which is attained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly, the optimal non-asymptotic risk exhibits an additional logarithmic factor over the ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet exceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of the distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent smoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on two effective sparsity parameters. As part of the analysis, we also derive a sharp high-probability upper bound on the missing mass.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.

<title>seq-JEPA: Autoregressive Predictive Learning of Invariant-Equivariant World Models</title>

arXiv:2505.03176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current self-supervised algorithms commonly rely on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations. This is achieved by enforcing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm often limits the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between high-level invariance-demanding tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we proposes \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling framework that introduces architectural inductive biases into joint-embedding predictive architectures to resolve this trade-off. Without relying on dual equivariance predictors or loss terms, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to specified transformations and another invariant to them. To do so, our model processes short sequences of different views (observations) of inputs. Each encoded view is concatenated with an embedding of the relative transformation (action) that produces the next observation in the sequence. These view-action pairs are passed through a transformer encoder that outputs an aggregate representation. A predictor head then conditions this aggregate representation on the upcoming action to predict the representation of the next observation. Empirically, seq-JEPA demonstrates strong performance on both equivariant and invariant benchmarks without sacrificing one for the other. Furthermore, it excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.

Abstract: Contextual online decision-making problems with constraints appear in a wide range of real-world applications, such as adaptive experimental design under safety constraints, personalized recommendation with resource limits, and dynamic pricing under fairness requirements. In this paper, we investigate a general formulation of sequential decision-making with stage-wise feasibility constraints, where at each round, the learner must select an action based on observed context while ensuring that a problem-specific feasibility criterion is satisfied. We propose a unified algorithmic framework that captures many existing constrained learning problems, including constrained bandits, active learning with label budgets, online hypothesis testing with Type I error control, and model calibration. Central to our approach is the concept of upper counterfactual confidence bounds, which enables the design of practically efficient online algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees using any offline conditional density estimation oracle. To handle feasibility constraints in complex environments, we introduce a generalized notion of the eluder dimension, extending it from the classical setting based on square loss to a broader class of metric-like probability divergences. This allows us to capture the complexity of various density function classes and characterize the utility regret incurred due to feasibility constraint uncertainty. Our result offers a principled foundation for constrained sequential decision-making in both theory and practice.

<title>Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?</title>

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.

Abstract: Learning how the world works is central to building AI agents that can adapt to complex environments. Traditional world models based on deep learning demand vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date, application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World) synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's Revenge. We release our code and display the learned world models and videos of the agent's gameplay at https://topwasu.github.io/poe-world.

Abstract: The success of unsupervised learning raises the question of whether also supervised models can be trained without using the information in the output $y$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is indeed possible. The key step is to formulate the model as a smoother, i.e. on the form $\hat{f}=Sy$, and to construct the smoother matrix $S$ independently of $y$, e.g. by training on random labels. We present a simple model selection criterion based on the distribution of the out-of-sample predictions and show that, in contrast to cross-validation, this criterion can be used also without access to $y$. We demonstrate on real and synthetic data that $y$-free trained versions of linear and kernel ridge regression, smoothing splines, and neural networks perform similarly to their standard, $y$-based, versions and, most importantly, significantly better than random guessing.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using expert demonstrations often suffer from the imitation problem, where the model learns to reproduce the correct responses without understanding the underlying rationale. To address this limitation, we propose Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD), a novel multi-stage framework that integrates teacher model generated explanatory critiques and refined responses into the SFT process. A student model is then trained to map the triplet of prompt, teacher critique, and its own initial response to the corresponding refined teacher response, thereby learning both what to imitate and why. Using entropy-based analysis, we show that CGD reduces refinement uncertainty and can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior update. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of CGD, on variety of benchmark tasks, and demonstrate significant gains on both math (AMC23 +17.5%) and language understanding tasks (MMLU-Pro +6.3%), while successfully mitigating the format drift issues observed in previous critique fine-tuning (CFT) techniques.

Abstract: Agents powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse complex applications. Recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), wherein multiple agents collaborate and communicate with each other, have exhibited enhanced capabilities in complex tasks, such as high-quality code generation and arithmetic reasoning. However, the development of such systems often relies on handcrafted methods, and the literature on systematic design and optimization of LLM-based MAS remains limited.
  In this work, we introduce OMAC, a general framework designed for holistic optimization of LLM-based MAS. Specifically, we identify five key optimization dimensions for MAS, encompassing both agent functionality and collaboration structure. Building upon these dimensions, we first propose a general algorithm, utilizing two actors termed the Semantic Initializer and the Contrastive Comparator, to optimize any single dimension. Then, we present an algorithm for joint optimization across multiple dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of OMAC on code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and general reasoning tasks against state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through \textit{function vectors} (FVs), recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize FVs to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task promptings forms do not induce a common task representation through FVs but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.

Summary:
Granger causality analysis in time series can be challenging due to non-linear dependencies. The proposed Granger causal xLSTM (GC-xLSTM) model utilizes the extended Long Short-Term Memory architecture to capture long-range relations between variables. By enforcing sparsity through a dynamic loss penalty on the initial projection, the model identifies and improves sparsity candidates. Through joint optimization, Granger causal relations are robustly recovered. Experimental evaluation on six datasets showcases the effectiveness of the GC-xLSTM model, demonstrating its potential in analyzing and predicting causal relationships between time series variables.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Causality in time series can be difficult to determine, especially in the presence of non-linear dependencies. The concept of Granger causality helps analyze potential relationships between variables, thereby offering a method to determine whether one time series can predict - Granger cause - future values of another. Although successful, Granger causal methods still struggle with capturing long-range relations between variables. To this end, we leverage the recently successful Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture and propose Granger causal xLSTMs (GC-xLSTM). It first enforces sparsity between the time series components by using a novel dynamic loss penalty on the initial projection. Specifically, we adaptively improve the model and identify sparsity candidates. Our joint optimization procedure then ensures that the Granger causal relations are recovered robustly. Our experimental evaluation on six diverse datasets demonstrates the overall efficacy of our proposed GC-xLSTM model.

Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.

Summary:  This study compares semi-supervised learning (SSL) and pre-trained models in scenarios with limited labeled data. The Few-shot SSL framework is introduced to enable a fair comparison between the two approaches by controlling the amount of labeled data. Extensive experiments show that pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generally outperform SSL methods, especially in high-resolution data with clear semantic structure. The study suggests that future SSL research should consider comparing with pre-trained models and exploring ways to integrate pre-trained knowledge for enhanced performance, such as using it to improve pseudo-labeling. To support further research, the authors have released a unified reproduction and evaluation framework, with codes available for access. <div>

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) alleviates the cost of data labeling process by exploiting unlabeled data, and has achieved promising results on various tasks such as image classification. Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks. Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?} To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL} -- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research, we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework.

ZenFlow is a novel offloading framework designed to fine-tune large language models efficiently. It prioritizes important parameters and updates them on the GPU, while less important ones are offloaded to the CPU for asynchronous processing. This approach prevents severe GPU stalls and reduces PCIe traffic, resulting in up to a 5x speedup in training speed. ZenFlow also introduces a lightweight gradient selection method that exploits the locality of important gradients, avoiding the need for costly global synchronization when scaling across multiple GPUs. Overall, ZenFlow achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining model accuracy. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.12242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often exceeds GPU memory limits, prompting systems to offload model states to CPU memory. However, existing offloaded training frameworks like ZeRO-Offload treat all parameters equally and update the full model on the CPU, causing severe GPU stalls, where fast, expensive GPUs sit idle waiting for slow CPU updates and limited-bandwidth PCIe transfers. We present ZenFlow, a new offloading framework that prioritizes important parameters and decouples updates between GPU and CPU. ZenFlow performs in-place updates of important gradients on GPU, while asynchronously offloading and accumulating less important ones on CPU, fully overlapping CPU work with GPU computation. To scale across GPUs, ZenFlow introduces a lightweight gradient selection method that exploits a novel spatial and temporal locality property of important gradients, avoiding costly global synchronization. ZenFlow achieves up to 5x end-to-end speedup, 2x lower PCIe traffic, and reduces GPU stalls by over 85 percent, all while preserving accuracy.

<div> neural network operators, memory effects, randomness, fractional derivatives, stochastic perturbations
Summary: 
This work introduces a new class of neural network operators designed to address problems involving memory effects and randomness. These operators combine symmetrized activation functions, Caputo-type fractional derivatives, and stochastic perturbations through It\^o type noise, providing a powerful framework for approximating functions with long-term memory and uncertain dynamics. The mathematical foundations of these operators are developed, with key theorems proving their asymptotic behavior, convergence in the mean-square sense, and consistency under fractional regularity assumptions. The estimates explicitly consider the memory parameter alpha and noise level sigma. In an application to the fractional Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, commonly used to model turbulence in fluid flows with memory, the proposed theory offers theoretical guarantees on approximation quality. This research suggests that these neural operators can be valuable in analyzing and simulating complex systems, particularly in turbulent phenomena and multiscale processes where memory and randomness play crucial roles. By integrating concepts from neural networks, fractional calculus, and stochastic analysis, this work paves the way for hybrid learning-based methods supported by strong analytical foundations.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed to handle problems where memory effects and randomness play a central role. In this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed to handle problems where memory effects and randomness play a central role. These operators merge symmetrized activation functions, Caputo-type fractional derivatives, and stochastic perturbations introduced via It\^o type noise. The result is a powerful framework capable of approximating functions that evolve over time with both long-term memory and uncertain dynamics. We develop the mathematical foundations of these operators, proving three key theorems of Voronovskaya type. These results describe the asymptotic behavior of the operators, their convergence in the mean-square sense, and their consistency under fractional regularity assumptions. All estimates explicitly account for the influence of the memory parameter $\alpha$ and the noise level $\sigma$. As a practical application, we apply the proposed theory to the fractional Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, a model often used to describe turbulence in fluid flows with memory. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees for the approximation quality and suggests that these neural operators can serve as effective tools in the analysis and simulation of complex systems. By blending ideas from neural networks, fractional calculus, and stochastic analysis, this research opens new perspectives for modeling turbulent phenomena and other multiscale processes where memory and randomness are fundamental. The results lay the groundwork for hybrid learning-based methods with strong analytical backing.

Abstract: The pursuit of alpha returns that exceed market benchmarks has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from intuition-driven investing to autonomous, AI powered systems. This paper introduces a comprehensive five stage taxonomy that traces this progression across manual strategies, statistical models, classical machine learning, deep learning, and agentic architectures powered by large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior surveys focused narrowly on modeling techniques, this review adopts a system level lens, integrating advances in representation learning, multimodal data fusion, and tool augmented LLM agents. The strategic shift from static predictors to contextaware financial agents capable of real time reasoning, scenario simulation, and cross modal decision making is emphasized. Key challenges in interpretability, data fragility, governance, and regulatory compliance areas critical to production deployment are examined. The proposed taxonomy offers a unified framework for evaluating maturity, aligning infrastructure, and guiding the responsible development of next generation alpha systems.

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work introduces test-time compute (TTC)-allocating additional computational resources during inference-as a compelling complement to conventional scaling strategies. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size. Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and adaptable deployment of future language models without incurring additional pretraining costs.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework, the Long-term Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN, for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting. This framework addresses the limitation of current STGNNs in capturing long-term spatial-temporal dependencies and similarities across MTS data for accurate forecasting. It incorporates a Long-term History Encoder to encode long-term history, a Hierarchical Representation Retriever to include spatial information, and a Transformer-based Aggregator to selectively fuse contextual representations. Experimental results show that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72% on average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on real-world datasets. It also improves prediction accuracy by 9.8% on rapidly changing patterns in the datasets. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-term spatial-temporal correlations and improving prediction accuracy in MTS forecasting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications in both industry and academia. Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting. Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator (TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72% on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the datasets.

<div> Keywords: denoising diffusion probabilistic models, synthetic sensor signals, similarity metrics, training optimization, generative models 

Summary: 
Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have the ability to generate synthetic sensor signals by training them using a loss function that measures the difference between added noise and predicted noise. However, the randomness in the process and the loss function itself make it challenging to assess the data quality. To address this, the study explores various similarity metrics and adapts an existing metric to monitor the training and data synthesis processes. This adapted metric can be fine-tuned on input data to align with classification task requirements. By using this approach, the researchers were able to significantly reduce the number of training epochs without compromising classification performance, leading to resource savings and faster training of generative models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are able to generate synthetic sensor signals. The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time for training generative models.

Summary:
Diffusion models are powerful in generating various types of data but suffer from slow inference due to sequential denoising processes. Traditional parallelization methods have high communication overhead. The ParaStep method proposed in this study utilizes a reuse-then-predict mechanism to parallelize diffusion inference by capitalizing on similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike existing approaches, ParaStep minimizes communication overhead by employing lightweight, step-wise communication. The results demonstrate significant speedups of up to 3.88x on SVD, 2.43x on CogVideoX-2b, and 6.56x on AudioLDM2-large while maintaining generation quality. ParaStep proves to be a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, especially in environments with limited bandwidth.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD, \textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained personal devices due to high computational and memory demands for task-specific fine-tuning. In this paper, the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH) is introduced, suggesting that certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions during fine-tuning iterations. Building on OSSH, the Quaff framework is proposed, which optimizes low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers in invariant channels using lightweight operations, reducing quantization errors and memory usage. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that Quaff improves efficiency, performance, and deployability. On the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves latency reduction, memory savings, and accuracy enhancement over full-precision fine-tuning, allowing for personalized LLM deployment on consumer-grade GPUs like the RTX 2080 Super without compromising model utility.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment.

<div> Composites, Finite Element Modelling, Convolutional Neural Networks, Explainable AI, Mechanical Properties <br />
Summary: <br />
Composites are widely used materials, necessitating accurate assessment of their mechanical properties through Finite Element (FE) modelling. Current FE models are computationally expensive, leading to the use of AI models, but existing approaches lack accuracy and transparency. This study introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Explainable AI (XAI) methods to predict composite mechanical properties with high accuracy. Custom CNNs trained on transverse tension test data outperform a baseline model, ResNet-34, in estimating Young's modulus and yield strength. XAI methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients are employed to explain predictions, showcasing the critical geometrical features influencing composite behavior. This transparency allows engineers to validate model trustworthiness and aligns with the science of composites, enhancing understanding and application in various industries. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Composites are amongst the most important materials manufactured today, as evidenced by their use in countless applications. In order to establish the suitability of composites in specific applications, finite element (FE) modelling, a numerical method based on partial differential equations, is the industry standard for assessing their mechanical properties. However, FE modelling is exceptionally costly from a computational viewpoint, a limitation which has led to efforts towards applying AI models to this task. However, in these approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward neural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focus on predicting elastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits; and the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users. In this paper, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with methods from explainable AI (XAI) can be successfully deployed to solve this problem. Our approach uses customised CNNs trained on a dataset we generate using transverse tension tests in FE modelling to predict composites' mechanical properties, i.e., Young's modulus and yield strength. We show empirically that our approach achieves high accuracy, outperforming a baseline, ResNet-34, in estimating the mechanical properties. We then use SHAP and Integrated Gradients, two post-hoc XAI methods, to explain the predictions, showing that the CNNs use the critical geometrical features that influence the composites' behaviour, thus allowing engineers to verify that the models are trustworthy by representing the science of composites.

Abstract: GraphSAGE is a widely used graph neural network. The introduction of causal inference has improved its robust performance and named as Causal GraphSAGE. However, Causal GraphSAGE focuses on measuring causal weighting among individual nodes, but neglecting the cooperative relationships among sampling nodes as a whole. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cooperative Causal GraphSAGE (CoCa-GraphSAGE), which combines cooperative game theory with Causal GraphSAGE. Initially, a cooperative causal structure model is constructed in the case of cooperation based on the graph structure. Subsequently, Cooperative Causal sampling (CoCa-sampling) algorithm is proposed, employing the Shapley values to calculate the cooperative contribution based on causal weights of the nodes sets. CoCa-sampling guides the selection of nodes with significant cooperative causal effects during the neighborhood sampling process, thus integrating the selected neighborhood features under cooperative relationships, which takes the sampled nodes as a whole and generates more stable target node embeddings. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed method has comparable classification performance to the compared methods and outperforms under perturbations, demonstrating the robustness improvement by CoCa-sampling.

<div> Keywords: Deep Neural Networks, cyclic optimization, Iterative Constructive Perturbation, self-distillation, training variations

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel framework for training Deep Neural Networks that addresses the challenge of balancing performance and generalization. The key innovation is the Iterative Constructive Perturbation (ICP) technique, which optimizes both the model and its input data concurrently. By iteratively perturbing the input based on the model's loss, enhanced representations are gradually constructed. These enhanced features are then used in a self-distillation framework to improve performance and generalization. The approach alternately adjusts the model's parameters and the input data, bridging the gap between fitting and generalization. Experimental results show that the proposed method overcomes common performance bottlenecks in neural networks and achieves significant improvements across various training variations. Through this cyclic optimization strategy, the framework offers a new perspective on training deep neural networks for enhanced performance and generalization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable achievements across various domains, however balancing performance and generalization still remains a challenge while training these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uses a cyclic optimization strategy to concurrently optimize the model and its input data for better training, rethinking the traditional training paradigm. Central to our approach is Iterative Constructive Perturbation (ICP), which leverages the model's loss to iteratively perturb the input, progressively constructing an enhanced representation over some refinement steps. This ICP input is then fed back into the model to produce improved intermediate features, which serve as a target in a self-distillation framework against the original features. By alternately altering the model's parameters to the data and the data to the model, our method effectively addresses the gap between fitting and generalization, leading to enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only mitigates common performance bottlenecks in neural networks but also demonstrates significant improvements across training variations.

<div> framework, data synthesis, Large Language Models, simulation, statistical alignment
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel framework, LLMSynthor, for data synthesis that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture the statistical structure of real-world distributions. LLMSynthor transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators by utilizing them as nonparametric copula simulators to model high-order dependencies. It introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to enhance sampling efficiency and alignment with real data, without rejection sampling. The iterative synthesis loop minimizes discrepancies in summary statistics space, gradually uncovering and refining generative structures. Evaluations in controlled and real-world settings demonstrate the high statistical fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability of the synthetic data generated. LLMSynthor proves valuable in various domains such as economics, social science, and urban studies by producing synthetic data that accurately represents real-world distributions. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating synthetic data that faithfully captures the statistical structure of real-world distributions is a fundamental challenge in data modeling. Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals their potential as flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient, constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment. Given this, we introduce LLMSynthor, a general framework for data synthesis that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional feedback. LLMSynthor treats the LLM as a nonparametric copula simulator for modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We evaluate LLMSynthor in both controlled and real-world settings using heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce, population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSynthor shows high statistical fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as a valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian optimization, Large Language Models, contextual knowledge, surrogate modeling, exploration-exploitation trade-off 

Summary:
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular tool for optimizing costly black-box functions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in low-data scenarios, making them attractive for black-box optimization. However, using LLMs alone poses risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty. To address this, LLINBO combines LLMs with statistical surrogate models like Gaussian Processes to improve optimization reliability. This hybrid approach leverages LLMs for early exploration and statistical models for efficient exploitation. The paper introduces three mechanisms for collaboration and establishes theoretical guarantees for their effectiveness. A real-world application in 3D printing showcases the proposed framework's efficacy. The code for reproducing the results is available on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO: LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to reproduce the results can be found at https://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/LLM-in-the-Loop-BO.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on developing deep learning models to forecast the number of patients in the emergency department boarding phase six hours in advance. Data from various sources were used to train the models, which included ResNetPlus, TSTPlus, TSiTPlus, and N-BEATSx. The best-performing model was N-BEATSx, achieving high accuracy metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination. The model showed stability even during high boarding count periods.

Abstract: This study develops deep learning models to forecast the number of patients in the emergency department (ED) boarding phase six hours in advance, aiming to support proactive operational decision-making using only non-clinical, operational, and contextual features. Data were collected from five sources: ED tracking systems, inpatient census records, weather reports, federal holiday calendars, and local event schedules. After feature engineering, the data were aggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for model training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus, TSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using Optuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count was 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best performance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08, root mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95. The model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high boarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard deviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts are achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong performance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of additional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions. This framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital systems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding.

The paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel optimizer for neural networks inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation simulations. The optimizer reimagines the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, promoting parameter diversity during optimization. This helps mitigate parameter condensation, preventing the collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces. The approach is rooted in physics and models stochastic particle collisions using a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation. Mathematical proof and a physical interpretation of the property are established. Extensive experiments on image and text classification tasks show that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers like Adam and SGD, achieving accuracy improvements with comparable computation cost. <div>

Abstract: The design of optimization algorithms for neural networks remains a critical challenge, with most existing methods relying on heuristic adaptations of gradient-based approaches. This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains comparable.

Abstract: Data engineering pipelines are essential - albeit costly - components of predictive analytics frameworks requiring significant engineering time and domain expertise for carrying out tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, an automated data engineering pipeline via text embeddings. At the core of the ADEPT framework is a simple yet powerful idea that the entropy of embeddings corresponding to textually dense raw format representation of time series can be intuitively viewed as equivalent (or in many cases superior) to that of numerically dense vector representations obtained by data engineering pipelines. Consequently, ADEPT uses a two step approach that (i) leverages text embeddings to represent the diverse data sources, and (ii) constructs a variational information bottleneck criteria to mitigate entropy variance in text embeddings of time series data. ADEPT provides an end-to-end automated implementation of predictive models that offers superior predictive performance despite issues such as missing data, ill-formed records, improper or corrupted data formats and irregular timestamps. Through exhaustive experiments, we show that the ADEPT outperforms the best existing benchmarks in a diverse set of datasets from large-scale applications across healthcare, finance, science and industrial internet of things. Our results show that ADEPT can potentially leapfrog many conventional data pipeline steps thereby paving the way for efficient and scalable automation pathways for diverse data science applications.

Summary:<br />
Survival analysis is crucial in various real-world applications, but the uncertainty of predictions from survival models remains a challenge. SurvUnc is introduced as a model-agnostic framework for post-hoc uncertainty quantification in survival models. It leverages concordance knowledge and pairwise ranking performance to effectively estimate uncertainty without requiring modifications to the underlying survival model. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and various survival models, SurvUnc demonstrates superior performance in multiple evaluation scenarios, including selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. The results highlight SurvUnc's ability to enhance model interpretability and reliability, making survival predictions more trustworthy in high-stakes domains like healthcare and risk assessment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Survival analysis, which estimates the probability of event occurrence over time from censored data, is fundamental in numerous real-world applications, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and risk assessment. Despite advances in numerous survival models, quantifying the uncertainty of predictions from these models remains underexplored and challenging. The lack of reliable uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and trustworthiness of survival models, hindering their adoption in clinical decision-making and other sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, in this work, we introduce SurvUnc, a novel meta-model based framework for post-hoc uncertainty quantification for survival models. SurvUnc introduces an anchor-based learning strategy that integrates concordance knowledge into meta-model optimization, leveraging pairwise ranking performance to estimate uncertainty effectively. Notably, our framework is model-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with any survival model without requiring modifications to its architecture or access to its internal parameters. Especially, we design a comprehensive evaluation pipeline tailored to this critical yet overlooked problem. Through extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking datasets and five representative survival models, we demonstrate the superiority of SurvUnc across multiple evaluation scenarios, including selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. Our results highlight the effectiveness of SurvUnc in enhancing model interpretability and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy survival predictions in real-world applications.

<div> Keywords: imitation learning, satisficing theory, deep reinforcement learning, policy, demonstrations

Summary:
Focused on satisficing theory, this study challenges the assumption in imitation learning that demonstrations are near-optimal. Instead, it proposes a focused satisficing approach that aims to surpass the demonstrator's personal levels of aspiration without explicitly learning them. By using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, the approach focuses the policy on imitating the highest quality parts of demonstrations. Experimental results show that this method outperforms existing imitation learning techniques by providing higher rates of guaranteed acceptability to the demonstrator while achieving competitive true returns in various environments. This approach allows for the identification of acceptable behaviors that may not be optimal but still meet the demonstrator's aspiration levels, leading to more robust imitation learning outcomes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning often assumes that demonstrations are close to optimal according to some fixed, but unknown, cost function. However, according to satisficing theory, humans often choose acceptable behavior based on their personal (and potentially dynamic) levels of aspiration, rather than achieving (near-) optimality. For example, a lunar lander demonstration that successfully lands without crashing might be acceptable to a novice despite being slow or jerky. Using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, our focused satisficing approach to imitation learning seeks a policy that surpasses the demonstrator's aspiration levels -- defined over trajectories or portions of trajectories -- on unseen demonstrations without explicitly learning those aspirations. We show experimentally that this focuses the policy to imitate the highest quality (portions of) demonstrations better than existing imitation learning methods, providing much higher rates of guaranteed acceptability to the demonstrator, and competitive true returns on a range of environments.

Summary:
In this work, a model-based continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) algorithm is proposed to achieve both sample and computational efficiency. The approach uses optimism-based confidence sets to establish the first sample complexity guarantee for CTRL with general function approximation. The algorithm can learn a near-optimal policy with a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_{\mathcal{R}} + d_{\mathcal{F}}}N^{-1/2})$ using $N$ measurements, where $d_{\mathcal{R}}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ are the distributional Eluder dimensions of the reward and dynamic functions, respectively. Structured policy updates and an alternative measurement strategy are introduced to reduce the number of policy updates and rollouts while maintaining sample efficiency. Experimental results on continuous control tasks and diffusion model fine-tuning demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer policy updates and rollouts.

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a principled framework for sequential decision-making in environments where interactions evolve continuously over time. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of CTRL remains limited, especially in settings with general function approximation. In this work, we propose a model-based CTRL algorithm that achieves both sample and computational efficiency.

Moreover, we introduce structured policy updates and an alternative measurement strategy that significantly reduce the number of policy updates and rollouts while maintaining competitive sample efficiency. We implemented experiments to backup our proposed algorithms on continuous control tasks and diffusion model fine-tuning, demonstrating comparable performance with significantly fewer policy updates and rollouts.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new causal inference framework called assimilative causal inference (ACI) that determines cause-and-effect relationships in a dynamic system. Unlike traditional methods, ACI identifies instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic evolution of causal influence ranges by solving an inverse problem using Bayesian data assimilation techniques. ACI captures the dynamic interplay of variables, where roles as causes and effects can shift over time. It utilizes a mathematically justified criteria to determine causal influence ranges without empirical thresholds and is scalable to high-dimensional problems. ACI is effective for short time series and incomplete datasets, making it applicable to complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events. Moreover, ACI does not require observations of potential causes, providing an advantage when drivers are unknown or unmeasured. <div>
arXiv:2505.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference determines cause-and-effect relationships between variables and has broad applications across disciplines. Traditional time-series methods often reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based information transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal relationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this paper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference (ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods, ACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state variables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic evolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of quantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an inverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward from observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is determined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect variables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables. ACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of variables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over time. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR without empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional problems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation techniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets. Notably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key advantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured.

Summary:
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly used to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new domains, but its statistical efficiency can be improved. This study introduces a method to increase efficiency by selecting an informative subset of training examples. By choosing examples that maximize information gain, measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM, the approach efficiently approximates the selection process. Using multinomial logistic regression models to linearize the LLM at the last layer aids in computational efficiency and analysis. Empirical testing on various problems confirms the method's effectiveness, supported by quantitative results and LLM evaluations. The proposed approach enhances SFT by optimizing the selection of training examples and demonstrates improved performance across different domains.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains. In this work, we improve the statistical efficiency of SFT by selecting an informative subset of training examples. Specifically, for a fixed budget of training examples, which determines the computational cost of fine-tuning, we determine the most informative ones. The key idea in our method is to select examples that maximize information gain, measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM. We approximate it efficiently by linearizing the LLM at the last layer using multinomial logistic regression models. Our approach is computationally efficient, analyzable, and performs well empirically. We demonstrate this on several problems, and back our claims with both quantitative results and an LLM evaluation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new causal discovery algorithm called Kausal, which utilizes a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism. This algorithm is designed to identify cause-effect mechanisms in complex systems with nonlinear dynamics. Traditional statistical approaches struggle with quantifying causal relationships in such systems due to feedback mechanisms and nonstationarity. Kausal leverages deep learning to infer optimal observables, which are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to determine causal estimates. The algorithm outperforms existing methods in discovering and characterizing causal signals. The study also applies Kausal to analyze the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The code for Kausal is openly available on GitHub for researchers to utilize. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We use a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism to develop a novel causal discovery algorithm, Kausal. Causal discovery aims to identify cause-effect mechanisms for better scientific understanding, explainable decision-making, and more accurate modeling. Standard statistical frameworks, such as Granger causality, lack the ability to quantify causal relationships in nonlinear dynamics due to the presence of complex feedback mechanisms, timescale mixing, and nonstationarity. This presents a challenge in studying many real-world systems, such as the Earth's climate. Meanwhile, Koopman operator methods have emerged as a promising tool for approximating nonlinear dynamics in a linear space of observables. In Kausal, we propose to leverage this powerful idea for causal analysis where optimal observables are inferred using deep learning. Causal estimates are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and defined as the distance between the marginal dynamics of the effect and the joint dynamics of the cause-effect observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate Kausal's superior ability in discovering and characterizing causal signals compared to existing approaches of prescribed observables. Lastly, we extend our analysis to observations of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation highlighting our algorithm's applicability to real-world phenomena. Our code is available at https://github.com/juannat7/kausal.

<div> Keywords: Transformer architecture, Attention computation, Subquadratic time complexity, Large head dimension, Fine-grained complexity assumptions

Summary:
Efficient attention computation methods have been a topic of interest, especially concerning the Transformer architecture. Current algorithms for computing attention have quadratic time complexity in context length, but recent research has shown subquadratic time is possible with certain conditions. This study explores when attention can be computed efficiently without constraints on temperature and aims to identify fast algorithms that scale appropriately with entry size B. The research presents a subquadratic time algorithm for attention even with large B and low-rank matrices, as well as for attention gradient computation in training processes. The study suggests that significant improvements beyond the proposed algorithm are unlikely and demonstrates that under specific conditions, the standard algorithm remains optimal. Overall, the research contributes to understanding the efficiency and limitations of attention computation in complex models like Transformers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Transformer architecture, the standard algorithm for computing Attention suffers from quadratic time complexity in context length $n$. Alman and Song [NeurIPS 2023] showed that when the head dimension $d = \Theta(\log n)$, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the inputs have small entries bounded by $B = o(\sqrt{\log n})$ in absolute values, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$). Equivalently, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the softmax is applied with high temperature for $d=\Theta(\log n)$. Running times of these algorithms depend exponentially on $B$ and thus they do not lead to even a polynomial-time algorithm outside the specific range of $B$.
  This naturally leads to the question: when can Attention be computed efficiently without strong assumptions on temperature? Are there fast attention algorithms that scale polylogarithmically with entry size $B$? In this work, we resolve this question and characterize when fast Attention for arbitrary temperatures is possible. First, for all constant $d = O(1)$, we give the first subquadratic $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 1/d} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(B))$ time algorithm for Attention with large $B$. Our result holds even for matrices with large head dimension if they have low rank. In this regime, we also give a similar running time for Attention gradient computation, and therefore for the full LLM training process. Furthermore, we show that any substantial improvement on our algorithm is unlikely. In particular, we show that even when $d = 2^{\Theta(\log^* n)}$, Attention requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time under $\mathsf{SETH}$.
  Finally, in the regime where $d = \mathrm{poly}(n)$, we show that the standard algorithm is optimal under popular fine-grained complexity assumptions.

Summary:<br />
Machine learning models have been successful in classifying variable stars, but they often encounter challenges with biases in the training data. This paper proposes a novel self-regulated training approach for variable star classification using synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced variational autoencoder. By incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data Release 3, the method facilitates a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a generative model to address biases and populate underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experimental results demonstrate that the self-regulated training approach outperforms traditional methods in classifying variable stars on biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements. This novel approach offers a promising solution to enhance the reliability of classifiers in variable star classification tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.

Summary: 
The study focuses on learning the mean of multiple groups with unknown data distributions in a fair manner. It employs an active learning framework to sequentially collect samples with bandit feedback, updating estimates of group means and variances. The objective is to minimize collective noise in estimators by selecting groups based on upper confidence bounds on variance estimates. The proposed Variance-UCB algorithm improves upon existing bounds on regret, providing efficient learning from various distributions. The research offers new insights for adaptive experimentation in online platforms and clinical trials, with promising results for minimizing noise in mean estimators. <div>
arXiv:2505.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fundamental learning problem over multiple groups with unknown data distributions, where an analyst would like to learn the mean of each group. Moreover, we want to ensure that this data is collected in a relatively fair manner such that the noise of the estimate of each group is reasonable. In particular, we focus on settings where data are collected dynamically, which is important in adaptive experimentation for online platforms or adaptive clinical trials for healthcare. In our model, we employ an active learning framework to sequentially collect samples with bandit feedback, observing a sample in each period from the chosen group. After observing a sample, the analyst updates their estimate of the mean and variance of that group and chooses the next group accordingly. The analyst's objective is to dynamically collect samples to minimize the collective noise of the estimators, measured by the norm of the vector of variances of the mean estimators.
  We propose an algorithm, Variance-UCB, that sequentially selects groups according to an upper confidence bound on the variance estimate. We provide a general theoretical framework for providing efficient bounds on learning from any underlying distribution where the variances can be estimated reasonably. This framework yields upper bounds on regret that improve significantly upon all existing bounds, as well as a collection of new results for different objectives and distributions than those previously studied.

<div> Keywords: large language model, inference acceleration, contextual sparsity, Polar Sparsity, GPU kernels

Summary: 
Polar Sparsity introduces a new sparsity technique that focuses on Attention layers as batch size and sequence length scale, shifting importance from MLP layers. While batch efficiency improves for MLP layers, their sparsity decreases, whereas Attention layers maintain stable sparsity and become more computationally expensive at scale. The development of hardware-efficient GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations results in significant speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 & 3, without compromising accuracy. This work demonstrates that Polar Sparsity can effectively scale to large batch sizes, providing substantial inference acceleration and making it practical for high-throughput LLM deployment systems. The code for this project is accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.

Summary:
This study focuses on improving fault diagnosis for power transformers using Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) through a machine learning-based approach. Traditional heuristic methods lack consistency, so a feature-weighted domain adaptation technique is proposed to address distribution shifts in diagnostic data among different transformers. By combining Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and feature-specific weighting (MCW), this method effectively aligns source and target domains. Experimental results show a 7.9% improvement over Fine-Tuning and a 2.2% improvement over MMD-CORAL (MC), demonstrating robustness across various training sample sizes. The proposed technique outperforms existing methods and enhances diagnostic accuracy for power transformer fault detection, critical for ensuring grid stability and reliable operation.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliable operation of power transformers is critical to grid stability. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is widely used for fault diagnosis, but traditional methods rely on heuristic rules, which may lead to inconsistent results. Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have improved diagnostic accuracy; however, power transformers operate under varying conditions, and differences in transformer type, environmental factors, and operational settings create distribution shifts in diagnostic data. Consequently, direct model transfer between transformers often fails, making techniques for domain adaptation a necessity. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a feature-weighted domain adaptation technique that combines Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Correlation Alignment (CORAL) with feature-specific weighting (MCW). Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics are used to assign adaptable weights, prioritizing features with larger distributional discrepancies and thereby improving source and target domain alignment. Experimental evaluations on datasets for power transformers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves a 7.9% improvement over Fine-Tuning and a 2.2% improvement over MMD-CORAL (MC). Furthermore, it outperforms both techniques across various training sample sizes, confirming its robustness for domain adaptation.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel framework for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of rolling bearings in industrial systems. The framework combines wavelet-based denoising method, Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), and a customized multi-channel Swin Transformer model (MCSFormer) to address degradation trends and noise presence. The model utilizes attention mechanisms for feature fusion to learn global and local degradation patterns, enhancing predictive performance. A customized loss function is developed to prioritize accurate early detection and minimize operation risks of late predictions. Evaluation with the PRONOSTIA dataset showed that MCSFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models in intra-condition experiments, achieved superior generalization in cross-condition testing, and effectively reduced late predictions with a custom loss function. The model's robust noise resistance, generalization capability, and focus on safety make MCSFormer a reliable predictive maintenance tool for industrial applications.

Abstract: Precise estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of rolling bearings is an important consideration to avoid unexpected failures, reduce downtime, and promote safety and efficiency in industrial systems. Complications in degradation trends, noise presence, and the necessity to detect faults in advance make estimation of RUL a challenging task. This paper introduces a novel framework that combines wavelet-based denoising method, Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), and a customized multi-channel Swin Transformer model (MCSFormer) to address these problems. With attention mechanisms incorporated for feature fusion, the model is designed to learn global and local degradation patterns utilizing hierarchical representations for enhancing predictive performance. Additionally, a customized loss function is developed as a key distinction of this work to differentiate between early and late predictions, prioritizing accurate early detection and minimizing the high operation risks of late predictions. The proposed model was evaluated with the PRONOSTIA dataset using three experiments. Intra-condition experiments demonstrated that MCSFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models, including the Adaptive Transformer, MDAN, and CNN-SRU, achieving 41%, 64%, and 69% lower MAE on average across different operating conditions, respectively. In terms of cross-condition testing, it achieved superior generalization under varying operating conditions compared to the adapted ViT and Swin Transformer. Lastly, the custom loss function effectively reduced late predictions, as evidenced in a 6.3% improvement in the scoring metric while maintaining competitive overall performance. The model's robust noise resistance, generalization capability, and focus on safety make MCSFormer a trustworthy and effective predictive maintenance tool in industrial applications.

<div> evolution of data, retraining, machine learning model, distribution shift detection, uncertainty-based method <br />
Summary: 
A new method is proposed to address the challenge of determining when to retrain machine learning models in response to evolving data. The problem is complicated by limited information, unknown distribution shifts, and the need to balance the cost of retraining with performance. Existing approaches are limited in different ways, prompting the development of a new uncertainty-based method. This method continually forecasts the model performance evolution using a bounded metric to make decisions on retraining. Experimental results on classification tasks across 7 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, consistently outperforming existing baselines. The method offers a comprehensive solution to the retraining problem by considering practical constraints, data scarcity, and cost trade-offs. <div>
arXiv:2505.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge in maintaining real-world machine learning models is responding to the continuous and unpredictable evolution of data. Most practitioners are faced with the difficult question: when should I retrain or update my machine learning model? This seemingly straightforward problem is particularly challenging for three reasons: 1) decisions must be made based on very limited information - we usually have access to only a few examples, 2) the nature, extent, and impact of the distribution shift are unknown, and 3) it involves specifying a cost ratio between retraining and poor performance, which can be hard to characterize. Existing works address certain aspects of this problem, but none offer a comprehensive solution. Distribution shift detection falls short as it cannot account for the cost trade-off; the scarcity of the data, paired with its unusual structure, makes it a poor fit for existing offline reinforcement learning methods, and the online learning formulation overlooks key practical considerations. To address this, we present a principled formulation of the retraining problem and propose an uncertainty-based method that makes decisions by continually forecasting the evolution of model performance evaluated with a bounded metric. Our experiments addressing classification tasks show that the method consistently outperforms existing baselines on 7 datasets.

Through an in-depth analysis, the impact of graphs, model architecture, and data on prediction performance is demonstrated.

Abstract: Accurately predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and designing effective therapies. Yet exhaustively exploring the space of possible perturbations (e.g., multi-gene perturbations or across tissues and cell types) is prohibitively expensive, motivating methods that can generalize to unseen conditions. In this work, we explore how knowledge graphs of gene-gene relationships can improve out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction across three challenging settings: unseen single perturbations; unseen double perturbations; and unseen cell lines. In particular, we present: (i) TxPert, a new state-of-the-art method that leverages multiple biological knowledge networks to predict transcriptional responses under OOD scenarios; (ii) an in-depth analysis demonstrating the impact of graphs, model architecture, and data on performance; and (iii) an expanded benchmarking framework that strengthens evaluation standards for perturbation modeling.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).
  Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM), assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle novel inputs without labeled OOD data.
  We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal reliability guarantees.
  The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.
  Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal human efforts.

<div> Keywords: certified unlearning, bias mitigation, graph data, machine learning, fairness enhancement

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to bias mitigation in machine learning models trained on graph data. The researchers propose a training-free unlearning procedure that uses a single-step Newton update on the model weights to certify bias mitigation. By selectively unlearning nodal features and structurally important elements in the graph, the proposed method aims to reduce algorithmic bias while maintaining high utility in tasks such as node classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the unlearning strategies in mitigating bias, with favorable trade-offs between utility and complexity compared to retraining from scratch with augmented data. The development of fairness-aware unlearning strategies and refined bounds for certified unlearning further contribute to the field of graph unlearning and bias mitigation in machine learning models. <div>
arXiv:2505.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing enforcement of the right to be forgotten regulations has propelled recent advances in certified (graph) unlearning strategies to comply with data removal requests from deployed machine learning (ML) models. Motivated by the well-documented bias amplification predicament inherent to graph data, here we take a fresh look at graph unlearning and leverage it as a bias mitigation tool. Given a pre-trained graph ML model, we develop a training-free unlearning procedure that offers certifiable bias mitigation via a single-step Newton update on the model weights. This way, we contribute a computationally lightweight alternative to the prevalent training- and optimization-based fairness enhancement approaches, with quantifiable performance guarantees. We first develop a novel fairness-aware nodal feature unlearning strategy along with refined certified unlearning bounds for this setting, whose impact extends beyond the realm of graph unlearning. We then design structural unlearning methods endowed with principled selection mechanisms over nodes and edges informed by rigorous bias analyses. Unlearning these judiciously selected elements can mitigate algorithmic biases with minimal impact on downstream utility (e.g., node classification accuracy). Experimental results over real networks corroborate the bias mitigation efficacy of our unlearning strategies, and delineate markedly favorable utility-complexity trade-offs relative to retraining from scratch using augmented graph data obtained via removals.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel framework for privacy-preserving conversion rate prediction in online advertising. It addresses the challenge of predicting conversion rates while respecting user privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. The proposed method enables collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients, using batch-level aggregated gradients to minimize privacy risks. It incorporates adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce communication costs. Additionally, de-biasing techniques are employed to train the model under label differential privacy, maintaining accuracy despite privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Experimental results on industrial datasets show competitive performance in terms of ROCAUC, reduced communication overhead, and compliance with privacy requirements. This framework sets a new standard for high-performance CVR prediction while ensuring privacy in the digital advertising landscape. <div>

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rate (CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction. This paper addresses the challenge of CVR prediction while adhering to user privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. Traditional methods face obstacles such as the reluctance of advertisers to share sensitive conversion data and the limitations of model training in secure environments like data clean rooms. We propose a novel model training framework that enables collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients with the advertising platform. Our approach introduces several innovative components: (1) utilizing batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level gradients to minimize privacy risks; (2) applying adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce communication costs; and (3) employing de-biasing techniques to train the model under label differential privacy, thereby maintaining accuracy despite privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Our experimental results, conducted on industrial datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive ROCAUC performance while significantly decreasing communication overhead and complying with both advertiser privacy requirements and user privacy choices. This framework establishes a new standard for privacy-preserving, high-performance CVR prediction in the digital advertising landscape.

Summary: 
The paper introduces smart-sizing, a training data strategy, focusing on label diversity, model-guided selection, and stopping based on marginal utility. They implement this through Adaptive Label Optimization (ALO), prioritizing labels that improve model performance significantly. Experiments show that models trained on 20-40 percent of data can match or surpass full-data baselines, especially in rare-class recall and edge case generalization. The study also highlights the impact of latent labeling errors on evaluation, emphasizing the need for audit tools and performance-aware governance.

Abstract: AI systems in high-consequence domains such as defense, intelligence, and disaster response must detect rare, high-impact events while operating under tight resource constraints. Traditional annotation strategies that prioritize label volume over informational value introduce redundancy and noise, limiting model generalization. This paper introduces smart-sizing, a training data strategy that emphasizes label diversity, model-guided selection, and marginal utility-based stopping. We implement this through Adaptive Label Optimization (ALO), combining pre-labeling triage, annotator disagreement analysis, and iterative feedback to prioritize labels that meaningfully improve model performance. Experiments show that models trained on 20 to 40 percent of curated data can match or exceed full-data baselines, particularly in rare-class recall and edge-case generalization. We also demonstrate how latent labeling errors embedded in training and validation sets can distort evaluation, underscoring the need for embedded audit tools and performance-aware governance. Smart-sizing reframes annotation as a feedback-driven process aligned with mission outcomes, enabling more robust models with fewer labels and supporting efficient AI development pipelines for frontier models and operational systems.

<div> Keywords: Deep neural networks, critical paths, anomaly detection, genetic evolution, ensemble detection<br />
Summary: <br />
- The study focuses on understanding and defending deep neural networks (DNNs) by extracting critical paths that can capture essential features in decision-making processes.
- Critical detection paths are identified using genetic evolution and mutation, considering that different paths in a DNN capture diverse features for the same target class.
- An ensemble approach is employed by combining results from multiple paths through random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism.
- Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses existing techniques and exhibits high accuracy in detecting various anomaly types.
- The approach demonstrates superior performance in capturing outliers and adversarial inputs by leveraging the unique activation patterns on critical paths. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously hard to understand and difficult to defend. Extracting representative paths (including the neuron activation values and the connections between neurons) from DNNs using software engineering approaches has recently shown to be a promising approach in interpreting the decision making process of blackbox DNNs, as the extracted paths are often effective in capturing essential features. With this in mind, this work investigates a novel approach that extracts critical paths from DNNs and subsequently applies the extracted paths for the anomaly detection task, based on the observation that outliers and adversarial inputs do not usually induce the same activation pattern on those paths as normal (in-distribution) inputs.
  In our approach, we first identify critical detection paths via genetic evolution and mutation. Since different paths in a DNN often capture different features for the same target class, we ensemble detection results from multiple paths by integrating random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results suggest that our method not only outperforms them, but it is also suitable for the detection of a broad range of anomaly types with high accuracy.

<div> Speculative decoding, hardware concurrency, autoregressive Transformer models, state-space models, efficiency, token generation<br />
<br />
Summary: Speculative decoding is a technique that utilizes hardware concurrency to enhance the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive Transformer models. State-space models (SSMs) already offer better efficiency than AR Transformers as their state summarizes past data without token caching. However, existing approaches to speculative decoding in SSMs do not leverage tree-based verification methods. This paper introduces a scalable algorithm for tree-based speculative decoding in SSMs and hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures. By exploiting the structure of state transition matrices, the algorithm minimizes overhead and improves inference speed. The proposed hardware-aware implementation outperforms vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs on multiple benchmarks, paving the way for further speed enhancements with SSM and hybrid models. Code availability will follow paper acceptance. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a technique to leverage hardware concurrency to improve the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive (AR) Transformer models by enabling multiple steps of token generation in a single forward pass. State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers, since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently. We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead to current SSM state update implementations. With the algorithm, we describe a hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<br />Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach to training flat goal-conditioned policies by utilizing subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. By eliminating the need for a generative model over the goal space, the proposed method overcomes the challenges of scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. The algorithm outperforms existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches in a variety of locomotion and manipulation benchmarks. The method achieves strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks where previous approaches struggle, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in complex environments. <div>
arXiv:2505.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

Summary:
The Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM) is introduced as a lightweight verifier for Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve mathematical reasoning. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to assign energy scores to Chain of Thought solutions, ranking candidates based on coherence and correctness. Without detailed annotations, EORM improves final answer accuracy on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8k and MATH. It enhances LLM reasoning reliability by efficiently verifying solutions, matching or exceeding brute force sampling performance. EORM's streamlined post hoc verification process ensures robust multi step logical consistency in mathematical reasoning tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach to selective classification, aiming to enhance the reliability of predictive models by allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. Through the application of the Neyman--Pearson lemma, the optimal rejection rule is characterized as a likelihood ratio test. This perspective unifies various post-hoc selection baselines and inspires new methods for selective classification. A key focus is on covariate shift, where the input distribution differs between training and testing. The proposed Neyman--Pearson-based methods outperform existing baselines across a range of vision and language tasks, including supervised learning and vision-language models. Through experiments, it is shown that likelihood ratio-based selection provides a robust mechanism for improving selective classification under covariate shifts. The code for these methods is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Selective classification enhances the reliability of predictive models by allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. In this work, we revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift, where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines, indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for improving selective classification under covariate shifts.

Summary:
This study investigates the approximation capabilities and convergence behaviors of one-layer transformers in noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning for next-token prediction. The research fills gaps in existing knowledge by proving the Bayes optimality of a class of one-layer transformers using linear and ReLU attention. Through finite-sample analysis, the study demonstrates that the expected loss of these transformers converges at a linear rate to the Bayes risk when trained with gradient descent. Additionally, the trained models exhibit generalization abilities to unseen samples and display observed learning behaviors. The theoretical findings are supported by extensive empirical validations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the performance of one-layer transformers in in-context reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities and on-convergence behaviors of one-layer transformers on the noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning of next-token prediction. Existing theoretical results focus on understanding the in-context reasoning behaviors for either the first gradient step or when the number of samples is infinite. Furthermore, no convergence rates nor generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations.

Abstract: Conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aggregate neighbor embeddings as holistic vectors, lacking the ability to identify fine-grained, direction-specific feature relevance. We propose MSH-GNN (Multi-Scale Harmonic Graph Neural Network), a novel architecture that performs feature-wise adaptive message passing through node-specific harmonic projections. For each node, MSH-GNN dynamically projects neighbor features onto frequency-sensitive directions determined by the target node's own representation. These projections are further modulated using learnable sinusoidal encodings at multiple frequencies, enabling the model to capture both smooth and oscillatory structural patterns across scales. A frequency-aware attention pooling mechanism is introduced to emphasize spectrally and structurally salient nodes during readout. Theoretically, we prove that MSH-GNN approximates shift-invariant kernels and matches the expressive power of the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Empirically, MSH-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on a wide range of graph and node classification tasks. Furthermore, in challenging classification settings involving joint variations in graph topology and spectral frequency, MSH-GNN excels at capturing structural asymmetries and high-frequency modulations, enabling more accurate graph discrimination.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices, driven by model advancements and hardware improvements, offers significant privacy benefits. However, these on-device LLMs inherently face performance limitations due to reduced model capacity and necessary compression techniques. To address this, we introduce a systematic methodology -- encompassing model capability, development efficiency, and system resources -- for evaluating on-device LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing models from 0.5B to 14B parameters and seven post-training quantization (PTQ) methods on commodity laptops, yields several critical insights: 1) System-level metrics exhibit near-linear scaling with effective bits-per-weight (BPW). 2) A practical threshold exists around $\sim$3.5 effective BPW, larger models subjected to low-bit quantization consistently outperform smaller models utilizing higher bit-precision. 3) Quantization with low BPW incurs marginal accuracy loss but significant memory savings. 4) Determined by low-level implementation specifics power consumption on CPU, where computation-intensive operations spend more power than memory-intensive ones. These findings offer crucial insights and practical guidelines for the efficient deployment and optimized configuration of LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Tango, a novel framework that uses reinforcement learning to concurrently train a large language model (LLM) generator and a process-level verifier in an interleaved manner. Unlike traditional approaches, Tango's verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards, leading to improved robustness and generalization. The generator within Tango achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple math benchmarks and reasoning tasks, while the verifier excels on the ProcessBench dataset. Both components exhibit substantial improvements on challenging mathematical reasoning problems, showcasing the effectiveness of the Tango framework in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The code for Tango is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However, current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

<br /><br />Summary: PiFlow, a new framework for automated scientific discovery, integrates rationality constraints and scientific principles to guide discovery in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

arXiv:2505.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research.

The paper introduces a unified framework for deep learning in any pseudo-metric space, decoupling the architecture from implementation. It presents a generalization bound that isolates the depth contribution in the growth of hidden layers, revealing a geometric dichotomy between sublinear and depth-independent rates. By linking polynomial growth to virtually nilpotent dynamics and exponential growth to expanding dynamics, the paper offers insights into the theoretical foundations of deep learning. Additionally, it provides covering-number estimates that show an exponential parameter saving for models with expanding dynamics, enhancing compositional expressivity. The results have implications for test-time inference and diffusion models, offering architecture-agnostic guarantees with a focus on dynamical systems awareness.

Abstract: Recent theory has reduced the depth dependence of generalization bounds from exponential to polynomial and even depth-independent rates, yet these results remain tied to specific architectures and Euclidean inputs. We present a unified framework for arbitrary \blue{pseudo-metric} spaces in which a depth-\(k\) network is the composition of continuous hidden maps \(f:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}\) and an output map \(h:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}\). The resulting bound $O(\sqrt{(\alpha + \log \beta(k))/n})$ isolates the sole depth contribution in \(\beta(k)\), the word-ball growth of the semigroup generated by the hidden layers. By Gromov's theorem polynomial (resp. exponential) growth corresponds to virtually nilpotent (resp. expanding) dynamics, revealing a geometric dichotomy behind existing $O(\sqrt{k})$ (sublinear depth) and $\tilde{O}(1)$ (depth-independent) rates. We further provide covering-number estimates showing that expanding dynamics yield an exponential parameter saving via compositional expressivity. Our results decouple specification from implementation, offering architecture-agnostic and dynamical-systems-aware guarantees applicable to modern deep-learning paradigms such as test-time inference and diffusion models.

<div> Keywords: multimodal time series, forecasting, MoTime, external modalities, cold-start forecasting <br />
Summary: <br />
This article introduces MoTime, a set of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that combine temporal signals with external modalities like text, metadata, and images. The datasets cover various domains and enable the evaluation of modality usefulness in two scenarios. Firstly, in the common forecasting task where variable-length history is accessible, and secondly, in cold-start forecasting where no historical data is present. Experiments demonstrate that external modalities can enhance forecasting performance in both scenarios, especially benefiting short series in some datasets, though the impact varies based on data characteristics. By releasing datasets and results publicly, the aim is to facilitate more comprehensive and practical evaluations in future multimodal time series forecasting studies. <br /> <div>

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.

<div> Keywords: feature engineering, agentic feature augmentation, Multi-Agent System, feature selection, feature generation

Summary:
Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of AI model performance improvement, where raw data is transformed into discriminative features. Existing methods often separate feature selection and generation, leading to a lack of balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions. To address this, a new approach called agentic feature augmentation is proposed, which unifies feature generation and selection through a Multi-Agent System with Long and Short-Term Memory (MAGS). This system includes a selector agent, a generator agent, and a router agent working together to optimize the feature space with immediate and long-term memory feedback. The router agent is trained using offline Proximal Policy Optimization to make effective decisions. Experimental results show that this unified agentic framework consistently outperforms traditional methods by intelligently coordinating feature selection and generation.

Abstract: As a widely-used and practical tool, feature engineering transforms raw data into discriminative features to advance AI model performance. However, existing methods usually apply feature selection and generation separately, failing to strive a balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions. To fill this gap, we propose an agentic feature augmentation concept, where the unification of feature generation and selection is modeled as agentic teaming and planning. Specifically, we develop a Multi-Agent System with Long and Short-Term Memory (MAGS), comprising a selector agent to eliminate redundant features, a generator agent to produce informative new dimensions, and a router agent that strategically coordinates their actions. We leverage in-context learning with short-term memory for immediate feedback refinement and long-term memory for globally optimal guidance. Additionally, we employ offline Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement fine-tuning to train the router agent for effective decision-making to navigate a vast discrete feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this unified agentic framework consistently achieves superior task performance by intelligently orchestrating feature selection and generation.

<div> attention mechanism, transformer architecture, gradient estimator, backpropagation, computational graph

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a method to optimize the backpropagation process in transformer models by cutting backpropagation through attention weights. By probabilistically selecting a parameter *c* to limit the number of interactions each token has per attention head, the compute requirements for attention backpropagation can be reduced from quadratic to linear complexity. Empirical results show that cutting 99% of attention gradient flow with an appropriate choice of *c* results in minimal increase in gradient variance, making the approach promising for training transformer models on long sequences efficiently. This method allows for a more efficient sparse matrix implementation, reducing the backward pass cost significantly compared to the forward pass cost. <div>
arXiv:2505.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical transformer model, cutting $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing $c \sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about $1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when training a transformer model on long sequences.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in healthcare, where accurate predictions of future health trajectories can significantly impact clinical decision-making. Ensuring transparency and explainability of the models responsible for these tasks is essential for their adoption in critical settings. Recent work has explored a top-down approach to bi-level transparency, focusing on understanding trends and properties of predicted time series using static features. In this work, we extend this framework by incorporating exogenous time series features alongside static features in a structured manner, while maintaining cohesive interpretation. Our approach leverages the insights of trajectory comprehension to introduce an encoding mechanism for exogenous time series, where they are decomposed into meaningful trends and properties, enabling the extraction of interpretable patterns. Through experiments on several synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our approach remains predictive while preserving interpretability and robustness. This work represents a step towards developing robust, and generalized time series forecasting models. The code is available at https://github.com/jeremy-qin/TIMEVIEW

arXiv:2505.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo), for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings, balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated great promise for learning generalizable graph representations from unlabeled data. However, conventional GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety of datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD), without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

<title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Entropy Minimization in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL, without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples. Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any labeled data or even any parameter updates.

Abstract: This paper investigates infinite-horizon average reward Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) with general parametrization. We propose a Primal-Dual Natural Actor-Critic algorithm that adeptly manages constraints while ensuring a high convergence rate. In particular, our algorithm achieves global convergence and constraint violation rates of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ over a horizon of length $T$ when the mixing time, $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, is known to the learner. In absence of knowledge of $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, the achievable rates change to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T^{0.5-\epsilon})$ provided that $T \geq \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}^{2/\epsilon}\right)$. Our results match the theoretical lower bound for Markov Decision Processes and establish a new benchmark in the theoretical exploration of average reward CMDPs.

<title>EC-LDA : Label Distribution Inference Attack against Federated Graph Learning with Embedding Compression</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis. Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.

arXiv:2505.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a popular method to accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) while retaining their superior text generation performance. Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative decoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models in an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper proposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the configuration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being generated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework BanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms, UCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity, the stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and adversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to universal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and Qwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing methods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in simulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts.

Abstract: Transformer models (TMs) have exhibited remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, allowing them to generalize to and improve in previously unseen environments without re-training or fine-tuning. This is typically accomplished by imitating the complete learning histories of a source RL algorithm over a substantial amount of pretraining environments, which, however, may transfer suboptimal behaviors inherited from the source algorithm/dataset. Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting suboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the success of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet effective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by reweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and stability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first approach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be combined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We substantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted on the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and continuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD, DPT, DICP) as the backbones. LHF exhibits robust performance across a variety of suboptimal scenarios, as well as under varying hyperparameters and sampling strategies. Notably, the superior performance of LHF becomes more pronounced in the presence of noisy data, indicating the significance of filtering learning histories.

Abstract: In the past few years, time series foundation models have achieved superior predicting accuracy. However, real-world time series often exhibit significant diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains, making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex scenarios. In addition, time series data may have multiple variables exhibiting complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining and finetuning stages, overlooking the valuable inter-series dependencies. To this end, we propose \textbf{Time Tracker} for better predictions on multivariate time series data. Firstly, we leverage sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers to handle the modeling of diverse time series patterns, thereby alleviating the learning difficulties of a single model while improving its generalization. Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention, enabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and multivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling during pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we design a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from frequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture inter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling. Based on these advancements, Time Tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting accuracy, model generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Feature Transformation (FT) crafts new features from original ones via mathematical operations to enhance dataset expressiveness for downstream models. However, existing FT methods exhibit critical limitations: discrete search struggles with enormous combinatorial spaces, impeding practical use; and continuous search, being highly sensitive to initialization and step sizes, often becomes trapped in local optima, restricting global exploration. To overcome these limitations, DIFFT redefines FT as a reward-guided generative task. It first learns a compact and expressive latent space for feature sets using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). A Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) then navigates this space to generate high-quality feature embeddings, its trajectory guided by a performance evaluator towards task-specific optima. This synthesis of global distribution learning (from LDM) and targeted optimization (reward guidance) produces potent embeddings, which a novel semi-autoregressive decoder efficiently converts into structured, discrete features, preserving intra-feature dependencies while allowing parallel inter-feature generation. Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets show DIFFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and robustness, with significantly lower training and inference times.

Abstract: Lipschitz neural networks are well-known for providing certified robustness in deep learning. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient Block Reflector Orthogonal (BRO) layer that enhances the capability of orthogonal layers on constructing more expressive Lipschitz neural architectures. In addition, by theoretically analyzing the nature of Lipschitz neural networks, we introduce a new loss function that employs an annealing mechanism to increase margin for most data points. This enables Lipschitz models to provide better certified robustness. By employing our BRO layer and loss function, we design BRONet - a simple yet effective Lipschitz neural network that achieves state-of-the-art certified robustness. Extensive experiments and empirical analysis on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet validate that our method outperforms existing baselines.

arXiv:2505.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying graph neural networks in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe a significant difference in the relationship between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix for in-distribution (ID) and OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps (the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right) \mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We present extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses to support our empirical results. As a parameter-free post-hoc method, SpecGap can be easily integrated into existing graph neural network models without requiring any additional training or model modification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep models have highlighted the need for intelligent systems that combine continual learning (CL) for knowledge acquisition with machine unlearning (MU) for data removal, forming the Continual Learning-Unlearning (CLU) paradigm. While existing work treats CL and MU as separate processes, we reveal their intrinsic connection through a unified optimization framework based on Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization. This framework decomposes gradient updates for approximate CLU into four components: learning new knowledge, unlearning targeted data, preserving existing knowledge, and modulation via weight saliency. A critical challenge lies in balancing knowledge update and retention during sequential learning-unlearning cycles. To resolve this stability-plasticity dilemma, we introduce a remain-preserved manifold constraint to induce a remaining Hessian compensation for CLU iterations. A fast-slow weight adaptation mechanism is designed to efficiently approximate the second-order optimization direction, combined with adaptive weighting coefficients and a balanced weight saliency mask, proposing a unified implementation framework for gradient-based CLU. Furthermore, we pioneer task-agnostic CLU scenarios that support fine-grained unlearning at the cross-task category and random sample levels beyond the traditional task-aware setups. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UG-CLU framework effectively coordinates incremental learning, precise unlearning, and knowledge stability across multiple datasets and model architectures, providing a theoretical foundation and methodological support for dynamic, compliant intelligent systems.

<title>NeuBM: Mitigating Model Bias in Graph Neural Networks through Neutral Input Calibration</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across various domains, yet they often struggle with model bias, particularly in the presence of class imbalance. This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM (Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced feature representations throughout the network.

Abstract: Retraining a model using its own predictions together with the original, potentially noisy labels is a well-known strategy for improving the model performance. While prior works have demonstrated the benefits of specific heuristic retraining schemes, the question of how to optimally combine the model's predictions and the provided labels remains largely open. This paper addresses this fundamental question for binary classification tasks. We develop a principled framework based on approximate message passing (AMP) to analyze iterative retraining procedures for two ground truth settings: Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Our main contribution is the derivation of the Bayes optimal aggregator function to combine the current model's predictions and the given labels, which when used to retrain the same model, minimizes its prediction error. We also quantify the performance of this optimal retraining strategy over multiple rounds. We complement our theoretical results by proposing a practically usable version of the theoretically-optimal aggregator function for linear probing with the cross-entropy loss, and demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods in the high label noise regime.

<title>Pass@K Policy Optimization: Solving Harder Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15201</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.

<title>Group Distributionally Robust Optimization with Flexible Sample Queries</title>

arXiv:2505.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) aims to develop models that perform well across $m$ distributions simultaneously. Existing GDRO algorithms can only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and therefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically. To address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries and cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex optimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice (PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm, constructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is either 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader. Then, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious PLA. Building upon the above approach, we develop a GDRO algorithm that allows an arbitrary and varying sample size per round, achieving a high-probability optimization error bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{t}\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^t \frac{m}{r_j}\log m}\right)$, where $r_t$ denotes the sample size at round $t$. This result demonstrates that the optimization error decreases as the number of samples increases and implies a consistent sample complexity of $O(m\log (m)/\epsilon^2)$ for any fixed sample size $r\in[m]$, aligning with existing bounds for cases of $r=1$ or $m$. We validate our approach on synthetic binary and real-world multi-class datasets.

Abstract: Efficient task scheduling is paramount in the Linux kernel, where the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) meticulously manages CPU resources to balance high utilization with interactive responsiveness. This research pioneers the use of deep learning techniques to predict the sequence of tasks selected by CFS, aiming to evaluate the feasibility of a more generalized and potentially more adaptive task scheduler for diverse workloads. Our core contributions are twofold: first, the systematic generation and curation of a novel scheduling dataset from a running Linux kernel, capturing real-world CFS behavior; and second, the development, training, and evaluation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network designed to accurately forecast the next task to be scheduled. This paper further discusses the practical pathways and implications of integrating such a predictive model into the kernel's scheduling framework. The findings and methodologies presented herein open avenues for data-driven advancements in kernel scheduling, with the full source code provided for reproducibility and further exploration.

arXiv:2505.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in Ref.~\citep{cpkan_implementation}.

arXiv:2505.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural systems, including neural circuits involved in decision making, can be modeled as high-dimensional dynamical systems with multiple stable states. While existing analytical tools primarily describe behavior near stable equilibria, characterizing separatrices -- the manifolds that delineate boundaries between different basins of attraction -- remains challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce a numerical framework leveraging Koopman Theory combined with Deep Neural Networks to effectively characterize separatrices. Specifically, we approximate Koopman Eigenfunctions (KEFs) associated with real positive eigenvalues, which vanish precisely at the separatrices. Utilizing these scalar KEFs, optimization methods efficiently locate separatrices even in complex systems. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic benchmarks, ecological network models, and recurrent neural networks trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks. Moreover, we illustrate the practical utility of our method by designing optimal perturbations that can shift systems across separatrices, enabling predictions relevant to optogenetic stimulation experiments in neuroscience.

<title>Neural Collapse is Globally Optimal in Deep Regularized ResNets and Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical emergence of neural collapse -- a surprising symmetry in the feature representations of the training data in the penultimate layer of deep neural networks -- has spurred a line of theoretical research aimed at its understanding. However, existing work focuses on data-agnostic models or, when data structure is taken into account, it remains limited to multi-layer perceptrons. Our paper fills both these gaps by analyzing modern architectures in a data-aware regime: we prove that global optima of deep regularized transformers and residual networks (ResNets) with LayerNorm trained with cross entropy or mean squared error loss are approximately collapsed, and the approximation gets tighter as the depth grows. More generally, we formally reduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an equivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the literature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that, as the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.

<title>Reliable Vertical Federated Learning in 5G Core Network Architecture</title>

arXiv:2505.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

<title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations with Causal Logit Perturbation</title>

arXiv:2505.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has seen widespread success in various domains such as science, industry, and society. However, it is acknowledged that certain approaches suffer from non-robustness, relying on spurious correlations for predictions. Addressing these limitations is of paramount importance, necessitating the development of methods that can disentangle spurious correlations. {This study attempts to implement causal models via logit perturbations and introduces a novel Causal Logit Perturbation (CLP) framework to train classifiers with generated causal logit perturbations for individual samples, thereby mitigating the spurious associations between non-causal attributes (i.e., image backgrounds) and classes.} {Our framework employs a} perturbation network to generate sample-wise logit perturbations using a series of training characteristics of samples as inputs. The whole framework is optimized by an online meta-learning-based learning algorithm and leverages human causal knowledge by augmenting metadata in both counterfactual and factual manners. Empirical evaluations on four typical biased learning scenarios, including long-tail learning, noisy label learning, generalized long-tail learning, and subpopulation shift learning, demonstrate that CLP consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, visualization results support the effectiveness of the generated causal perturbations in redirecting model attention towards causal image attributes and dismantling spurious associations.

<title>Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection: Bridging Uncertainty Characterization and Pattern Classification</title>

Abstract: Fuzzy rough feature selection (FRFS) is an effective means of addressing the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional data. By removing redundant and irrelevant features, FRFS helps mitigate classifier overfitting, enhance generalization performance, and lessen computational overhead. However, most existing FRFS algorithms primarily focus on reducing uncertainty in pattern classification, neglecting that lower uncertainty does not necessarily result in improved classification performance, despite it commonly being regarded as a key indicator of feature selection effectiveness in the FRFS literature. To bridge uncertainty characterization and pattern classification, we propose a Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection (MAFRFS) framework that considers both the compactness and separation of label classes. MAFRFS effectively reduces uncertainty in pattern classification tasks, while guiding the feature selection towards more separable and discriminative label class structures. Extensive experiments on 15 public datasets demonstrate that MAFRFS is highly scalable and more effective than FRFS. The algorithms developed using MAFRFS outperform six state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.

Abstract: Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in practice, getting trapped in early discovered modes and requiring prolonged training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques may rely on heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is directly driven by the main GFlowNet's training loss. By prioritizing trajectories where the main model exhibits high loss, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across various benchmarks including grid environments, structured sequence generation, and Bayesian structure learning, LGGFN consistently enhances exploration efficiency and sample diversity compared to baselines. For instance, on a challenging sequence generation task, it discovered over 40 times more unique valid modes while simultaneously reducing the exploration error metric by approximately 99\%.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements (e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

<title>Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $\mu$P</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of deep neural networks, the key of which lies in effectively characterizing the disparities between OoD and In-Distribution (InD) data. In this work, such disparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature subspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD features to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns of OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their different distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations of InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD detection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and deploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD data. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear subspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the computation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we reveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD disparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for constructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to approximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations. In particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD data confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of discriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the non-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical explorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations, yielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and efficiency.

Abstract: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%. Our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Explorer-19BE for reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the informativeness of individual samples in a dataset is an important objective in deep learning, as it can guide sample selection, which can improve model efficiency and accuracy by removing redundant or potentially harmful samples. We propose Laplace Sample Information (LSI) measure of sample informativeness grounded in information theory widely applicable across model architectures and learning settings. LSI leverages a Bayesian approximation to the weight posterior and the KL divergence to measure the change in the parameter distribution induced by a sample of interest from the dataset. We experimentally show that LSI is effective in ordering the data with respect to typicality, detecting mislabeled samples, measuring class-wise informativeness, and assessing dataset difficulty. We demonstrate these capabilities of LSI on image and text data in supervised and unsupervised settings. Moreover, we show that LSI can be computed efficiently through probes and transfers well to the training of large models.

Abstract: Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%. For reproducibility, our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4RLensemble-F7EE.

Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Multivariable time series forecasting methods can integrate information from exogenous variables, leading to significant prediction accuracy gains. Transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential dependencies. However, a na\"ive application of transformers often struggles to effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate against this, we propose a novel architecture, namely the Spectral Operator Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of $47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of $1.1\%$ against the most competitive baseline (different per task). We further show that MVCA -- when put in place of the na\"ive attention used in various deep learning models -- can remedy its deficiencies, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$ on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures, and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation, offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning in physics-informed machine learning.

<title>SSR: Speculative Parallel Scaling Reasoning in Test-time</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on multi-step mathematical reasoning, yet at the cost of high computational overhead. This challenge is particularly acute for test-time scaling methods such as parallel decoding, which increase answer diversity but scale poorly in efficiency. To address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose SSR (Speculative Parallel Scaling Reasoning), a training-free framework that leverages a key insight: by introducing speculative decoding at the step level, we can accelerate reasoning without sacrificing correctness. SSR integrates two components: a Selective Parallel Module (SPM) that identifies a small set of promising reasoning strategies via model-internal scoring, and Step-level Speculative Decoding (SSD), which enables efficient draft-target collaboration for fine-grained reasoning acceleration. Experiments on three mathematical benchmarks-AIME 2024, MATH-500, and LiveMathBench - demonstrate that SSR achieves strong gains over baselines. For instance, on LiveMathBench, SSR improves pass@1 accuracy by 13.84% while reducing computation to 80.5% of the baseline FLOPs. On MATH-500, SSR reduces compute to only 30% with no loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Neural network architectures have a large impact in machine learning. In reinforcement learning, network architectures have remained notably simple, as changes often lead to small gains in performance. This work introduces a novel encoder architecture for pixel-based model-free reinforcement learning. The Hadamax (\textbf{Hada}mard \textbf{max}-pooling) encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance by max-pooling Hadamard products between GELU-activated parallel hidden layers. Based on the recent PQN algorithm, the Hadamax encoder achieves state-of-the-art model-free performance in the Atari-57 benchmark. Specifically, without applying any algorithmic hyperparameter modifications, Hadamax-PQN achieves an 80\% performance gain over vanilla PQN and significantly surpasses Rainbow-DQN. For reproducibility, the full code is available on \href{https://github.com/Jacobkooi/Hadamax}{GitHub}.

<title>Human in the Loop Adaptive Optimization for Improved Time Series Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting models often produce systematic, predictable errors even in critical domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare. We introduce a novel post training adaptive optimization framework that improves forecast accuracy without retraining or architectural changes. Our method automatically applies expressive transformations optimized via reinforcement learning, contextual bandits, or genetic algorithms to correct model outputs in a lightweight and model agnostic way. Theoretically, we prove that affine corrections always reduce the mean squared error; practically, we extend this idea with dynamic action based optimization. The framework also supports an optional human in the loop component: domain experts can guide corrections using natural language, which is parsed into actions by a language model. Across multiple benchmarks (e.g., electricity, weather, traffic), we observe consistent accuracy gains with minimal computational overhead. Our interactive demo shows the framework's real time usability. By combining automated post hoc refinement with interpretable and extensible mechanisms, our approach offers a powerful new direction for practical forecasting systems.

<title>Distributionally Robust Federated Learning with Client Drift Minimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces critical challenges, particularly in heterogeneous environments where non-independent and identically distributed data across clients can lead to unfair and inefficient model performance. In this work, we introduce \textit{DRDM}, a novel algorithm that addresses these issues by combining a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework with dynamic regularization to mitigate client drift. \textit{DRDM} frames the training as a min-max optimization problem aimed at maximizing performance for the worst-case client, thereby promoting robustness and fairness. This robust objective is optimized through an algorithm leveraging dynamic regularization and efficient local updates, which significantly reduces the required number of communication rounds. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for convex smooth objectives under partial participation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, covering various model architectures and data heterogeneity levels, demonstrate that \textit{DRDM} significantly improves worst-case test accuracy while requiring fewer communication rounds than existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth on the energy consumption of participating clients, demonstrating that the number of local update steps can be adaptively selected to achieve a target worst-case test accuracy with minimal total energy cost across diverse communication environments.

arXiv:2505.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer quantization has emerged as a critical technique to facilitate deployment on resource-constrained devices. Although they do reduce the complexity of the learning models, their inference performance is often prone to quantization-induced errors. To this end, we introduce InTreeger: an end-to-end framework that takes a training dataset as input, and outputs an architecture-agnostic integer-only C implementation of tree-based machine learning model, without loss of precision. This framework enables anyone, even those without prior experience in machine learning, to generate a highly optimized integer-only classification model that can run on any hardware simply by providing an input dataset and target variable. We evaluated our generated implementations across three different architectures (ARM, x86, and RISC-V), resulting in significant improvements in inference latency. In addition, we show the energy efficiency compared to typical decision tree implementations that rely on floating-point arithmetic. The results underscore the advantages of integer-only inference, making it particularly suitable for energy- and area-constrained devices such as embedded systems and edge computing platforms, while also enabling the execution of decision trees on existing ultra-low power devices.

<title>HOPSE: Scalable Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder for Combinatorial Representations</title>

arXiv:2505.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder) -- a \emph{message passing-free} framework that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.

<title>Efficient Differentiable Approximation of Generalized Low-rank Regularization</title>

Abstract: Low-rank regularization (LRR) has been widely applied in various machine learning tasks, but the associated optimization is challenging. Directly optimizing the rank function under constraints is NP-hard in general. To overcome this difficulty, various relaxations of the rank function were studied. However, optimization of these relaxed LRRs typically depends on singular value decomposition, which is a time-consuming and nondifferentiable operator that cannot be optimized with gradient-based techniques. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose an efficient differentiable approximation of the generalized LRR. The considered LRR form subsumes many popular choices like the nuclear norm, the Schatten-$p$ norm, and various nonconvex relaxations. Our method enables LRR terms to be appended to loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion, and the GPU-friendly operations enable efficient and convenient implementation. Furthermore, convergence analysis is presented, which rigorously shows that both the bias and the variance of our rank estimator rapidly reduce with increased sample size and iteration steps. In the experimental study, the proposed method is applied to various tasks, which demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/naiqili/EDLRR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in partially observable environments poses significant challenges due to the complexity of learning under uncertainty. While additional information, such as that available in simulations, can enhance training, effectively leveraging it remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Guided Policy Optimization (GPO), a framework that co-trains a guider and a learner. The guider takes advantage of privileged information while ensuring alignment with the learner's policy that is primarily trained via imitation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that this learning scheme achieves optimality comparable to direct RL, thereby overcoming key limitations inherent in existing approaches. Empirical evaluations show strong performance of GPO across various tasks, including continuous control with partial observability and noise, and memory-based challenges, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Capturing nonlinear relationships without sacrificing interpretability remains a persistent challenge in regression modeling. We introduce SplitWise, a novel framework that enhances stepwise regression. It adaptively transforms numeric predictors into threshold-based binary features using shallow decision trees, but only when such transformations improve model fit, as assessed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This approach preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly capturing nonlinear effects. Implemented as a user-friendly R package, SplitWise is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that it consistently produces more parsimonious and generalizable models than traditional stepwise and penalized regression techniques.

arXiv:2505.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered. The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively, achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new fast-rate generalization bounds for multi-task and meta-learning in the unbalanced setting, i.e. when the tasks have training sets of different sizes, as is typically the case in real-world scenarios. Previously, only standard-rate bounds were known for this situation, while fast-rate bounds were limited to the setting where all training sets are of equal size. Our new bounds are numerically computable as well as interpretable, and we demonstrate their flexibility in handling a number of cases where they give stronger guarantees than previous bounds. Besides the bounds themselves, we also make conceptual contributions: we demonstrate that the unbalanced multi-task setting has different statistical properties than the balanced situation, specifically that proofs from the balanced situation do not carry over to the unbalanced setting. Additionally, we shed light on the fact that the unbalanced situation allows two meaningful definitions of multi-task risk, depending on whether if all tasks should be considered equally important or if sample-rich tasks should receive more weight than sample-poor ones.

Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight the flexibility of our framework by applying it to two novel scenarios not previously explored in this context: neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators, both yielding compelling results.

<title>Directional Non-Commutative Monoidal Structures for Compositional Embeddings in Machine Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to future work, which we plan to undertake.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI has driven an explosion in the size of datasets consumed and produced by AI models. Traditional methods for unstructured data visualization, such as t-SNE and UMAP, have not kept up with the pace of dataset scaling. This presents a significant challenge for AI explainability, which relies on methods such as t-SNE and UMAP for exploratory data analysis. In this paper, we introduce Negative Or Mean Affinity Discrimination (NOMAD) Projection, the first method for unstructured data visualization via nonlinear dimensionality reduction that can run on multiple GPUs at train time. We provide theory that situates NOMAD Projection as an approximate upper bound on the InfoNC-t-SNE loss, and empirical results that demonstrate NOMAD Projection's superior performance and speed profile compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the scalability of NOMAD Projection by computing the first complete data map of Multilingual Wikipedia.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that heavily relies on accurate advantage estimates for stable and efficient training. However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO (AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.

Abstract: While eXplainable AI (XAI) has advanced significantly, few methods address interpretability in embedded vector spaces where dimensions represent complex abstractions. We introduce Distance Explainer, a novel method for generating local, post-hoc explanations of embedded spaces in machine learning models. Our approach adapts saliency-based techniques from RISE to explain the distance between two embedded data points by assigning attribution values through selective masking and distance-ranked mask filtering. We evaluate Distance Explainer on cross-modal embeddings (image-image and image-caption pairs) using established XAI metrics including Faithfulness, Sensitivity/Robustness, and Randomization. Experiments with ImageNet and CLIP models demonstrate that our method effectively identifies features contributing to similarity or dissimilarity between embedded data points while maintaining high robustness and consistency. We also explore how parameter tuning, particularly mask quantity and selection strategy, affects explanation quality. This work addresses a critical gap in XAI research and enhances transparency and trustworthiness in deep learning applications utilizing embedded spaces.

Abstract: For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs, Bellman's principle of optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning (RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation, the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding temporal difference method. We demonstrate its potential advantages over transition kernel-based formulations, both qualitatively and empirically. The proposed formulation paves the way toward bridging stochastic optimal control and model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this position paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research directions to address them.

A central component of these models is the self-attention (SA) mechanism, which learns rich vector representations of tokens by modeling their relationships with others in a sequence. However, despite extensive research, transformers continue to suffer from training instability -- often manifesting as spikes or divergence in the training loss during a run.
  In this work, we identify one source of this instability: SA's limited ability to capture short-range dependencies, especially in tasks like language modeling, where almost every token heavily relies on its nearby neighbors. This limitation causes the pre-softmax logits of SA to grow rapidly, destabilizing training. To address this, we propose decomposing the SA into local (short-range) and global (long-range) attention heads. This decomposed attention, referred to as Long Short-attention (LS-attention), mitigates logit explosion and results in more stable training compared to an equivalent multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Empirical comparisons with two alternative training stabilization methods show that LS-attention reduces the validation perplexity to nearly 2/5 of that achieved by one method and reaches a similar perplexity as the other method using only 1/20 of the GPU hours. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that LS-attention reduces inference latency by up to 36% compared to a state-of-the-art implementation of equivalent MHSA.

<title>Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection in Power System Protection</title>

Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection. This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.

<title>Refining Neural Activation Patterns for Layer-Level Concept Discovery in Neural Network-Based Receivers</title>

Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts. Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor, consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting neural network behavior.

Abstract: The data-to-equation (Data2Eqn) task aims to discover interpretable mathematical equations that map observed values to labels, offering physical insights and broad applicability across academic and industrial domains. Genetic programming and traditional deep learning-based approaches suffer from search inefficiency and poor generalization on small task-specific datasets. Foundation models showed promise in this area, but existing approaches suffer from: 1) They are pretrained on general-purpose data distributions, making them less effective for domain-specific tasks; and 2) their training objectives focus on token-level alignment, overlooking mathematical semantics, which can lead to inaccurate equations. To address these issues, we aim to enhance the domain adaptability of foundation models for Data2Eqn tasks. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based finetuning framework that directly optimizes the generation policy of a pretrained model through reward signals derived from downstream numerical fitness. Our method allows the model to adapt to specific and complex data distributions and generate mathematically meaningful equations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves both the accuracy and robustness of equation generation under complex distributions.

<title>Federated Learning with Unlabeled Clients: Personalization Can Happen in Low Dimensions</title>

Abstract: Personalized federated learning has emerged as a popular approach to training on devices holding statistically heterogeneous data, known as clients. However, most existing approaches require a client to have labeled data for training or finetuning in order to obtain their own personalized model. In this paper we address this by proposing FLowDUP, a novel method that is able to generate a personalized model using only a forward pass with unlabeled data. The generated model parameters reside in a low-dimensional subspace, enabling efficient communication and computation. FLowDUP's learning objective is theoretically motivated by our new transductive multi-task PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, that provides performance guarantees for unlabeled clients. The objective is structured in such a way that it allows both clients with labeled data and clients with only unlabeled data to contribute to the training process. To supplement our theoretical results we carry out a thorough experimental evaluation of FLowDUP, demonstrating strong empirical performance on a range of datasets with differing sorts of statistically heterogeneous clients. Through numerous ablation studies, we test the efficacy of the individual components of the method.

arXiv:2505.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying learned control policies in real-world environments poses a fundamental challenge. When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.

<title>Beyond Classification: Evaluating Diffusion Denoised Smoothing for Security-Utility Trade off</title>

Abstract: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%. Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to be addressed.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.

<title>Benchmarking Energy and Latency in TinyML: A Novel Method for Resource-Constrained AI</title>

Abstract: The rise of IoT has increased the need for on-edge machine learning, with TinyML emerging as a promising solution for resource-constrained devices such as MCU. However, evaluating their performance remains challenging due to diverse architectures and application scenarios. Current solutions have many non-negligible limitations. This work introduces an alternative benchmarking methodology that integrates energy and latency measurements while distinguishing three execution phases pre-inference, inference, and post-inference. Additionally, the setup ensures that the device operates without being powered by an external measurement unit, while automated testing can be leveraged to enhance statistical significance. To evaluate our setup, we tested the STM32N6 MCU, which includes a NPU for executing neural networks. Two configurations were considered: high-performance and Low-power. The variation of the EDP was analyzed separately for each phase, providing insights into the impact of hardware configurations on energy efficiency. Each model was tested 1000 times to ensure statistically relevant results. Our findings demonstrate that reducing the core voltage and clock frequency improve the efficiency of pre- and post-processing without significantly affecting network execution performance. This approach can also be used for cross-platform comparisons to determine the most efficient inference platform and to quantify how pre- and post-processing overhead varies across different hardware implementations.

<title>Mechanistic Insights into Grokking from the Embedding Layer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking, a delayed generalization in neural networks after perfect training performance, has been observed in Transformers and MLPs, but the components driving it remain underexplored. We show that embeddings are central to grokking: introducing them into MLPs induces delayed generalization in modular arithmetic tasks, whereas MLPs without embeddings can generalize immediately. Our analysis identifies two key mechanisms: (1) Embedding update dynamics, where rare tokens stagnate due to sparse gradient updates and weight decay, and (2) Bilinear coupling, where the interaction between embeddings and downstream weights introduces saddle points and increases sensitivity to initialization. To confirm these mechanisms, we investigate frequency-aware sampling, which balances token updates by minimizing gradient variance, and embedding-specific learning rates, derived from the asymmetric curvature of the bilinear loss landscape. We prove that an adaptive learning rate ratio, \(\frac{\eta_E}{\eta_W} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\max}(E)}{\sigma_{\max}(W)} \cdot \frac{f_W}{f_E}\), mitigates bilinear coupling effects, accelerating convergence. Our methods not only improve grokking dynamics but also extend to broader challenges in Transformer optimization, where bilinear interactions hinder efficient training.

arXiv:2505.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning explainability aims to make the decision-making process of black-box models more transparent by finding the most important input features for a given prediction task. Recent works have proposed composing explanations from semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently interpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore the communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand the prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical doctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient may need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In this paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations. We propose an iterative procedure grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the rational speech act to generate explanations that maximize communicative utility. Our procedure only needs access to pairwise preferences between candidate explanations, relevant in real-world scenarios where a listener model may not be available. We evaluate our method in image classification tasks, demonstrating improved alignment between explanations and listener preferences across three datasets. Furthermore, we perform a user study that demonstrates our explanations increase communicative utility.

<title>Guidelines for the Quality Assessment of Energy-Aware NAS Benchmarks</title>

arXiv:2505.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is increasingly large energy consumption during the search process. Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model. Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i) reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results. Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection, returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study, we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to 8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the device.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of Bayesian ensembles and address the challenge of learning optimal combinations of Bayesian models in an online, continual learning setting. To this end, we reinterpret existing approaches such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Bayesian stacking through a novel empirical Bayes lens, shedding new light on the limitations and pathologies of BMA. Further motivated by insights from online optimization, we propose Online Bayesian Stacking (OBS), a method that optimizes the log-score over predictive distributions to adaptively combine Bayesian models. A key contribution of our work is establishing a novel connection between OBS and portfolio selection, bridging Bayesian ensemble learning with a rich, well-studied theoretical framework that offers efficient algorithms and extensive regret analysis. We further clarify the relationship between OBS and online BMA, showing that they optimize related but distinct cost functions. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we identify scenarios where OBS outperforms online BMA and provide principled guidance on when practitioners should prefer one approach over the other.

Abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification in stochastic multi-armed bandits under the fixed-confidence setting, with a particular focus on instances that admit multiple optimal arms. While the Track-and-Stop algorithm of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) is widely conjectured to be instance-optimal, its performance in the presence of multiple optima has remained insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the Track-and-Stop strategy and propose a modified stopping rule that ensures instance-optimality even when the set of optimal arms is not a singleton. Our analysis introduces a new information-theoretic lower bound that explicitly accounts for multiple optimal arms, and we demonstrate that our stopping rule tightly matches this bound.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding second-order stationary points (SOSP) in differentially private (DP) stochastic non-convex optimization. Existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) inaccurate convergence error rate due to overlooking gradient variance in the saddle point escape analysis, and (ii) dependence on auxiliary private model selection procedures for identifying DP-SOSP, which can significantly impair utility, particularly in distributed settings. To address these issues, we propose a generic perturbed stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) framework built upon Gaussian noise injection and general gradient oracles. A core innovation of our framework is using model drift distance to determine whether PSGD escapes saddle points, ensuring convergence to approximate local minima without relying on second-order information or additional DP-SOSP identification. By leveraging the adaptive DP-SPIDER estimator as a specific gradient oracle, we develop a new DP algorithm that rectifies the convergence error rates reported in prior work. We further extend this algorithm to distributed learning with arbitrarily heterogeneous data, providing the first formal guarantees for finding DP-SOSP in such settings. Our analysis also highlights the detrimental impacts of private selection procedures in distributed learning under high-dimensional models, underscoring the practical benefits of our design. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Decision trees are a fundamental tool in machine learning for representing, classifying, and generalizing data. It is desirable to construct ``small'' decision trees, by minimizing either the \textit{size} ($s$) or the \textit{depth} $(d)$ of the \textit{decision tree} (\textsc{DT}). Recently, the parameterized complexity of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning} has attracted a lot of attention. We consider a generalization of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning} where given a \textit{classification instance} $E$ and an integer $t$, the task is to find a ``small'' \textsc{DT} that disagrees with $E$ in at most $t$ examples. We consider two problems: \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}, where the goal is to construct a \textsc{DT} minimizing $s$ and $d$, respectively. We first establish that both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO} are W[1]-hard when parameterized by $s+\delta_{max}$ and $d+\delta_{max}$, respectively, where $\delta_{max}$ is the maximum number of features in which two differently labeled examples can differ. We complement this result by showing that these problems become \textsc{FPT} if we include the parameter $t$. We also consider the kernelization complexity of these problems and establish several positive and negative results for both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}.

Abstract: Sample-wise learning curves plot performance versus training set size. They are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone (i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning curves, we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe significant ill-behavior in approximately 14% of the learning curves, almost twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others. Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a challenging benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft" permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort. We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.

Abstract: Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.

arXiv:2505.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the authors introduced the theory of high-arity PAC learning, which is well-suited for learning graphs, hypergraphs and relational structures. In the same initial work, the authors proved a high-arity analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning that almost completely characterizes all notions of high-arity PAC learning in terms of a combinatorial dimension, called the Vapnik--Chervonenkis--Natarajan (VCN${}_k$) $k$-dimension, leaving as an open problem only the characterization of non-partite, non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability.
  In this work, we complete this characterization by proving that non-partite non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability implies a high-arity version of the Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finiteness of VCN${}_k$-dimension. This is done by obtaining direct proofs that classic PAC learnability implies classic Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finite Natarajan dimension and noticing that these direct proofs nicely lift to high-arity.

<title>A Unified Theoretical Analysis of Private and Robust Offline Alignment: from RLHF to DPO</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effects of noisy labels in offline alignment, with a focus on the interplay between privacy and robustness against adversarial corruption. Specifically, under linear modeling assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Conformal Prediction Under Local Differential Privacy</title>

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides sets of candidate classes with a guaranteed probability of containing the true class. However, it typically relies on a calibration set with clean labels. We address privacy-sensitive scenarios where the aggregator is untrusted and can only access a perturbed version of the true labels. We propose two complementary approaches under local differential privacy (LDP). In the first approach, users do not access the model but instead provide their input features and a perturbed label using a k-ary randomized response. In the second approach, which enforces stricter privacy constraints, users add noise to their conformity score by binary search response. This method requires access to the classification model but preserves both data and label privacy. Both approaches compute the conformal threshold directly from noisy data without accessing the true labels. We prove finite-sample coverage guarantees and demonstrate robust coverage even under severe randomization. This approach unifies strong local privacy with predictive uncertainty control, making it well-suited for sensitive applications such as medical imaging or large language model queries, regardless of whether users can (or are willing to) compute their own scores.

<title>Higher-order Structure Boosts Link Prediction on Temporal Graphs</title>

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have gained growing attention for modeling and predicting structures in temporal graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network, which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions. Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58, p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%). The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review (Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching, offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.

<title>Improving planning and MBRL with temporally-extended actions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting, it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning, better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved in the standard formulation.

<title>Projection-Based Correction for Enhancing Deep Inverse Networks</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based models have demonstrated remarkable success in solving illposed inverse problems; however, many fail to strictly adhere to the physical constraints imposed by the measurement process. In this work, we introduce a projection-based correction method to enhance the inference of deep inverse networks by ensuring consistency with the forward model. Specifically, given an initial estimate from a learned reconstruction network, we apply a projection step that constrains the solution to lie within the valid solution space of the inverse problem. We theoretically demonstrate that if the recovery model is a well-trained deep inverse network, the solution can be decomposed into range-space and null-space components, where the projection-based correction reduces to an identity transformation. Extensive simulations and experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy across diverse inverse problems and deep network architectures.

Abstract: In this work, we contribute the first approach to solve infinite-horizon discounted general-utility Markov decision processes (GUMDPs) in the single-trial regime, i.e., when the agent's performance is evaluated based on a single trajectory. First, we provide some fundamental results regarding policy optimization in the single-trial regime, investigating which class of policies suffices for optimality, casting our problem as a particular MDP that is equivalent to our original problem, as well as studying the computational hardness of policy optimization in the single-trial regime. Second, we show how we can leverage online planning techniques, in particular a Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, to solve GUMDPs in the single-trial regime. Third, we provide experimental results showcasing the superior performance of our approach in comparison to relevant baselines.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable insights for future model development.

<title>Fair Supervised Learning Through Constraints on Smooth Nonconvex Unfairness-Measure Surrogates</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new strategy for fair supervised machine learning is proposed. The main advantages of the proposed strategy as compared to others in the literature are as follows. (a) We introduce a new smooth nonconvex surrogate to approximate the Heaviside functions involved in discontinuous unfairness measures. The surrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and is new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight approximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed to other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction model in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to optimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding regularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a strategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for unfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of regularization. (c)~Our proposed strategy readily allows for constraints on multiple (potentially conflicting) unfairness measures at the same time. Multiple measures can be considered with a regularization approach, but at the cost of having even more difficult optimization problems to solve and further expense for tuning. By contrast, through hard constraints, our strategy leads to optimization models that can be solved tractably with minimal tuning.

<title>Model Merging is Secretly Certifiable: Non-Vacuous Generalisation Bounds for Low-Shot Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying the IID generalisation ability of deep networks is the first of many requirements for trusting AI in high-stakes applications from medicine to security. However, when instantiating generalisation bounds for deep networks it remains challenging to obtain non-vacuous guarantees, especially when applying contemporary large models on the small scale data prevalent in such high-stakes fields. In this paper, we draw a novel connection between a family of learning methods based on model fusion and generalisation certificates, and surprisingly show that with minor adjustment several existing learning strategies already provide non-trivial generalisation guarantees. Essentially, by focusing on data-driven learning of downstream tasks by fusion rather than fine-tuning, the certified generalisation gap becomes tiny and independent of the base network size, facilitating its certification. Our results show for the first time non-trivial generalisation guarantees for learning with as low as 100 examples, while using vision models such as VIT-B and language models such as mistral-7B. This observation is significant as it has immediate implications for facilitating the certification of existing systems as trustworthy, and opens up new directions for research at the intersection of practice and theory.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal distribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a noisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to develop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while providing sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior knowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator provides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed estimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by establishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the sparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to derive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under distribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training objectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and the classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen and van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms for such task.

Abstract: We present a neural framework for learning conditional optimal transport (OT) maps between probability distributions. Our approach introduces a conditioning mechanism capable of processing both categorical and continuous conditioning variables simultaneously. At the core of our method lies a hypernetwork that generates transport layer parameters based on these inputs, creating adaptive mappings that outperform simpler conditioning methods. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our method over baseline configurations. Furthermore, we showcase an application to global sensitivity analysis, offering high performance in computing OT-based sensitivity indices. This work advances the state-of-the-art in conditional optimal transport, enabling broader application of optimal transport principles to complex, high-dimensional domains such as generative modeling and black-box model explainability.

arXiv:2505.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of creating strong, yet narrow, AI systems. While recent AI progress has been driven by the training of large general-purpose foundation models, the creation of smaller models specialized for narrow domains could be valuable for both efficiency and safety. In this work, we explore two challenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic properties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations. The first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from scratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes necessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain narrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend on each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a curriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge regards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small specialized models. We find that model skills are often not perfectly localized to a particular set of prunable components. However, we find that methods based on pruning can still outperform distillation. We investigate the use of a regularization objective to align desired skills with prunable components while unlearning unnecessary skills.

Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding developer interactions, issue resolutions, and project dynamics within software engineering (SE). While traditional SE-specific sentiment analysis tools have made significant strides, they often fail to account for the nuanced and context-dependent language inherent to the domain. This study systematically evaluates the performance of bidirectional transformers, such as BERT, against generative pre-trained transformers, specifically GPT-4o-mini, in SE sentiment analysis. Using datasets from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Jira, we benchmark the models' capabilities with fine-tuned and default configurations. The results reveal that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini performs comparable to BERT and other bidirectional models on structured and balanced datasets like GitHub and Jira, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. However, on linguistically complex datasets with imbalanced sentiment distributions, such as Stack Overflow, the default GPT-4o-mini model exhibits superior generalization, achieving an accuracy of 85.3\% compared to the fine-tuned model's 13.1\%. These findings highlight the trade-offs between fine-tuning and leveraging pre-trained models for SE tasks. The study underscores the importance of aligning model architectures with dataset characteristics to optimize performance and proposes directions for future research in refining sentiment analysis tools tailored to the SE domain.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel parametrization approach for aeroelastic systems utilizing Koopman theory, specifically leveraging the Koopman Bilinear Form (KBF) model. To address the limitations of linear parametric dependence in the KBF model, we introduce the Extended KBF (EKBF) model, which enables a global linear representation of aeroelastic dynamics while capturing stronger nonlinear dependence on, e.g., the flutter parameter. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic example and a panel flutter problem. Results show that EKBF effectively interpolates and extrapolates principal eigenvalues, capturing flutter mechanisms, and accurately predicting the flutter boundary even when the data is corrupted by noise. Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron identified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter system.

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the transition from nucleate to film boiling, where heat transfer to the working fluid can rapidly deteriorate. Accurate CHF prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel surrogate modeling framework for aerodynamic applications based on Neural Fields. The proposed approach, MARIO (Modulated Aerodynamic Resolution Invariant Operator), addresses non parametric geometric variability through an efficient shape encoding mechanism and exploits the discretization-invariant nature of Neural Fields. It enables training on significantly downsampled meshes, while maintaining consistent accuracy during full-resolution inference. These properties allow for efficient modeling of diverse flow conditions, while reducing computational cost and memory requirements compared to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate methods. The framework is validated on two complementary datasets that reflect industrial constraints. First, the AirfRANS dataset consists in a two-dimensional airfoil benchmark with non-parametric shape variations. Performance evaluation of MARIO on this case demonstrates an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods across velocity, pressure, and turbulent viscosity fields, while accurately capturing boundary layer phenomena and aerodynamic coefficients. Second, the NASA Common Research Model features three-dimensional pressure distributions on a full aircraft surface mesh, with parametric control surface deflections. This configuration confirms MARIO's accuracy and scalability. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that Neural Field surrogates can provide rapid and accurate aerodynamic predictions under the computational and data limitations characteristic of industrial applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Dataset Distillation (MDD) seeks to condense large-scale image-text datasets into compact surrogates while retaining their effectiveness for cross-modal learning. Despite recent progress, existing MDD approaches often suffer from \textit{\textbf{Modality Collapse}}, characterized by over-concentrated intra-modal representations and enlarged distributional gap across modalities. In this paper, at the first time, we identify this issue as stemming from a fundamental conflict between the over-compression behavior inherent in dataset distillation and the cross-modal supervision imposed by contrastive objectives. To alleviate modality collapse, we introduce \textbf{RepBlend}, a novel MDD framework that weakens overdominant cross-modal supervision via representation blending, thereby significantly enhancing intra-modal diversity. Additionally, we observe that current MDD methods impose asymmetric supervision across modalities, resulting in biased optimization. To address this, we propose symmetric projection trajectory matching, which synchronizes the optimization dynamics using modality-specific projection heads, thereby promoting balanced supervision and enhancing cross-modal alignment. Experiments on Flickr-30K and MS-COCO show that RepBlend consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art MDD methods, achieving significant gains in retrieval performance (e.g., +9.4 IR@10, +6.3 TR@10 under the 100-pair setting) and offering up to 6.7$\times$ distillation speedup.

Abstract: Asymmetric, non-Gaussian probability distributions are often observed in the analysis of natural and engineering datasets. The lognormal distribution is a standard model for data with skewed frequency histograms and fat tails. However, the lognormal law severely restricts the asymptotic dependence of the probability density and the hazard function for high values. Herein we present a family of three-parameter non-Gaussian probability density functions that are based on generalized kappa-exponential and kappa-logarithm functions and investigate its mathematical properties. These kappa-lognormal densities represent continuous deformations of the lognormal with lighter right tails, controlled by the parameter kappa. In addition, bimodal distributions are obtained for certain parameter combinations. We derive closed-form analytic expressions for the main statistical functions of the kappa-lognormal distribution. For the moments, we derive bounds that are based on hypergeometric functions as well as series expansions. Explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood are obtained to facilitate numerical maximum-likelihood estimates of the kappa-lognormal parameters from data. We also formulate a joint probability density function for kappa-lognormal stochastic processes by applying Jacobi's multivariate theorem to a latent Gaussian process. Estimation of the kappa-lognormal distribution based on synthetic and real data is explored. Furthermore, we investigate applications of kappa-lognormal processes with different covariance kernels in time series forecasting and spatial interpolation using warped Gaussian process regression. Our results are of practical interest for modeling skewed distributions in various scientific and engineering fields.

Abstract: Bone fractures are a leading cause of morbidity and disability worldwide, imposing significant clinical and economic burdens on healthcare systems. Traditional X ray interpretation is time consuming and error prone, while existing machine learning and deep learning solutions often demand extensive feature engineering, large, annotated datasets, and high computational resources. To address these challenges, a distributed hybrid quantum classical pipeline is proposed that first applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then leverages a 4 qubit quantum amplitude encoding circuit for feature enrichment. By fusing eight PCA derived features with eight quantum enhanced features into a 16 dimensional vector and then classifying with different machine learning models achieving 99% accuracy using a public multi region X ray dataset on par with state of the art transfer learning models while reducing feature extraction time by 82%.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in approximately 5\% of the general population. Their rupture may lead to high mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and rupture remain unclear. While accurate for hemodynamic studies, conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive, hindering their deployment in large-scale or real-time clinical applications. To address this challenge, we curated a large-scale, high-fidelity aneurysm CFD dataset to facilitate the development of efficient machine learning algorithms for such applications. Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, we synthesized 10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD computations were performed on each shape under eight steady-state mass flow conditions, generating a total of 85,280 blood flow dynamics data covering key parameters. Furthermore, the dataset includes segmentation masks, which can support tasks that use images, point clouds or other multimodal data as input. Additionally, we introduced a benchmark for estimating flow parameters to assess current modeling methods. This dataset aims to advance aneurysm research and promote data-driven approaches in biofluids, biomedical engineering, and clinical risk assessment. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/Xigui-Li/Aneumo.

Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability. However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS, a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.

Abstract: Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.

<title>Effective climate policies for major emission reductions of ozone precursors: Global evidence from two decades</title>

Abstract: Despite policymakers deploying various tools to mitigate emissions of ozone (O\textsubscript{3}) precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NO\textsubscript{x}), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the effectiveness of policy combinations remains uncertain. We employ an integrated framework that couples structural break detection with machine learning to pinpoint effective interventions across the building, electricity, industrial, and transport sectors, identifying treatment effects as abrupt changes without prior assumptions about policy treatment assignment and timing. Applied to two decades of global O\textsubscript{3} precursor emissions data, we detect 78, 77, and 78 structural breaks for NO\textsubscript{x}, CO, and VOCs, corresponding to cumulative emission reductions of 0.96-0.97 Gt, 2.84-2.88 Gt, and 0.47-0.48 Gt, respectively. Sector-level analysis shows that electricity sector structural policies cut NO\textsubscript{x} by up to 32.4\%, while in buildings, developed countries combined adoption subsidies with carbon taxes to achieve 42.7\% CO reductions and developing countries used financing plus fuel taxes to secure 52.3\%. VOCs abatement peaked at 38.5\% when fossil-fuel subsidy reforms were paired with financial incentives. Finally, hybrid strategies merging non-price measures (subsidies, bans, mandates) with pricing instruments delivered up to an additional 10\% co-benefit. These findings guide the sequencing and complementarity of context-specific policy portfolios for O\textsubscript{3} precursor mitigation.

Abstract: Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves. Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and broader applications.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of buildings, particularly at Level of Detail 1 (LOD1), plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban planning, urban environmental studies, and designing optimized transportation networks. This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net, Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+ and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and 0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range, mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights, resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features, depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method, utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.

Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models for code often entail significant computational complexity, which grows significantly with the length of the input code sequence. We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to represent the tokens' importance. We advocate for the selective removal of tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization.Our evaluation shows LeanCode's superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and Slimcode, with improvements of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization, respectively.

In this paper, we design the first automated extraction pipeline to get 5W1H information from French news articles. To evaluate the performance of our algo- rithm, we also create a corpus of 250 Quebec news articles with 5W1H answers marked by four human annotators. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline performs as well in this task as the large language model GPT-4o.

Abstract: The hippocampus orchestrates spatial navigation through collective place cell encodings that form cognitive maps. We reconceptualize the population of place cells as position embeddings approximating multi-scale symmetric random walk transition kernels: the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle = q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, where $h(x, t)$ is the embedding at location $ x $, and $q(y|x, t)$ is the normalized symmetric transition probability over time $t$. The time parameter $\sqrt{t}$ defines a spatial scale hierarchy, mirroring the hippocampal dorsoventral axis. $q(y|x, t)$ defines spatial adjacency between $x$ and $y$ at scale or resolution $\sqrt{t}$, and the pairwise adjacency relationships $(q(y|x, t), \forall x, y)$ are reduced into individual embeddings $(h(x, t), \forall x)$ that collectively form a map of the environment at sale $\sqrt{t}$. Our framework employs gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t) = \langle h(x, t), h(y, t)\rangle$ with adaptive scale selection, choosing the time scale with maximal gradient at each step for trap-free, smooth trajectories. Efficient matrix squaring $P_{2t} = P_t^2$ builds global representations from local transitions $P_1$ without memorizing past trajectories, enabling hippocampal preplay-like path planning. This produces robust navigation through complex environments, aligning with hippocampal navigation. Experimental results show that our model captures place cell properties -- field size distribution, adaptability, and remapping -- while achieving computational efficiency. By modeling collective transition probabilities rather than individual place fields, we offer a biologically plausible, scalable framework for spatial navigation.

Abstract: This work aims to demystify the out-of-distribution (OOD) capabilities of in-context learning (ICL) by studying linear regression tasks parameterized with low-rank covariance matrices. With such a parameterization, we can model distribution shifts as a varying angle between the subspace of the training and testing covariance matrices. We prove that a single-layer linear attention model incurs a test risk with a non-negligible dependence on the angle, illustrating that ICL is not robust to such distribution shifts. However, using this framework, we also prove an interesting property of ICL: when trained on task vectors drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces, ICL can generalize to any subspace within their span, given sufficiently long prompt lengths. This suggests that the OOD generalization ability of Transformers may actually stem from the new task lying within the span of those encountered during training. We empirically show that our results also hold for models such as GPT-2, and conclude with (i) experiments on how our observations extend to nonlinear function classes and (ii) results on how LoRA has the ability to capture distribution shifts.

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in conjunction with unsupervised learning techniques to learn powerful node representations, but their deployment is hindered by their high sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and the absence of established methodologies for selecting the optimal models. To address these challenges, we propose LOBSTUR-GNN ({\bf Lo}cal {\bf B}oot{\bf s}trap for {\bf T}uning {\bf U}nsupervised {\bf R}epresentations in GNNs) i), a novel framework designed to adapt bootstrapping techniques for unsupervised graph representation learning. LOBSTUR-GNN tackles two main challenges: (a) adapting the bootstrap edge and feature resampling process to account for local graph dependencies in creating alternative versions of the same graph, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluating learned representations without ground-truth labels. Using locally bootstrapped resampling and leveraging Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess embedding consistency, LOBSTUR provides a principled approach for hyperparameter tuning in unsupervised GNNs. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method through extensive experiments on established academic datasets, showing an 65.9\% improvement in the classification accuracy compared to an uninformed selection of hyperparameters. Finally, we deploy our framework on a real-world application, thereby demonstrating its validity and practical utility in various settings. \footnote{The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}{github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}.}

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training) remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks (Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles, we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses, and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on 90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels, models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning, and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for classification tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of in-vehicle network protocols such as controller area networks (CAN) and proposed machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as an effective mitigation technique. However, their efficient integration into vehicular architecture is non-trivial, with existing methods relying on electronic control units (ECUs)-coupled IDS accelerators or dedicated ECUs as IDS accelerators. Here, initiating IDS requires complete reception of a CAN message from the controller, incurring data movement and software overheads. In this paper, we present SecCAN, a novel CAN controller architecture that embeds IDS capability within the datapath of the controller. This integration allows IDS to tap messages directly from within the CAN controller as they are received from the bus, removing overheads incurred by existing ML-based IDSs. A custom-quantised machine-learning accelerator is developed as the IDS engine and embedded into SecCAN's receive data path, with optimisations to overlap the IDS inference with the protocol's reception window. We implement SecCAN on AMD XCZU7EV FPGA to quantify its performance and benefits in hardware, using multiple attack datasets. We show that SecCAN can completely hide the IDS latency within the CAN reception window for all CAN packet sizes and detect multiple attacks with state-of-the-art accuracy with zero software overheads on the ECU and low energy overhead (73.7 uJ per message) for IDS inference. Also, SecCAN incurs limited resource overhead compared to a standard CAN controller (< 30% LUT, < 1% FF), making it ideally suited for automotive deployment.

Abstract: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over 128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

Abstract: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents JARVIS, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain expertise to generate high-quality scripts for specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks. By combining a domain-specific LLM trained with synthetically generated data, a custom compiler for structural verification, rule enforcement, code fixing capabilities, and advanced retrieval mechanisms, our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our framework addresses the challenges of data scarcity and hallucination errors in LLMs, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in specialized engineering domains. We evaluate our framework on multiple benchmarks and show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy and reliability. Our work sets a new precedent for the application of LLMs in EDA and paves the way for future innovations in this field.

Abstract: Generalizing control policies to novel embodiments remains a fundamental challenge in enabling scalable and transferable learning in robotics. While prior works have explored this in locomotion, a systematic study in the context of manipulation tasks remains limited, partly due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for learning cross-embodiment manipulation, focusing on two foundational tasks-reach and push-across a diverse range of morphologies. The benchmark is designed to test generalization along three axes: interpolation (testing performance within a robot category that shares the same link structure), extrapolation (testing on a robot with a different link structure), and composition (testing on combinations of link structures). On the benchmark, we evaluate the ability of different RL policies to learn from multiple morphologies and to generalize to novel ones. Our study aims to answer whether morphology-aware training can outperform single-embodiment baselines, whether zero-shot generalization to unseen morphologies is feasible, and how consistently these patterns hold across different generalization regimes. The results highlight the current limitations of multi-embodiment learning and provide insights into how architectural and training design choices influence policy generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design. SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and adaptive MAS.

<title>Unraveling the iterative CHAD</title>

Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally formulated as a semantics-driven source transformation for reverse-mode AD in total programming languages. We extend this framework to partial languages with features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics. Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax, showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives. Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types, partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique.

Abstract: First-order adaptive optimization methods like Adam are the default choices for training modern deep neural networks. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of these methods in non-smooth settings, particularly in Deep ReLU networks, remains limited. ReLU activations create exponentially many region boundaries where standard smoothness assumptions break down. \textbf{We derive the first \(\tilde{O}\!\bigl(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{eff}}/n}\bigr)\) generalization bound for Adam in Deep ReLU networks and the first global-optimal convergence for Adam in the non smooth, non convex relu landscape without a global PL or convexity assumption.} Our analysis is based on stratified Morse theory and novel results in Kakeya sets. We develop a multi-layer refinement framework that progressively tightens bounds on region crossings. We prove that the number of region crossings collapses from exponential to near-linear in the effective dimension. Using a Kakeya based method, we give a tighter generalization bound than PAC-Bayes approaches and showcase convergence using a mild uniform low barrier assumption.

Abstract: Daily environments have profound influence on our health and behavior. Recent work has shown that digital envirotyping, where computer vision is applied to images of daily environments taken during ecological momentary assessment (EMA), can be used to identify meaningful relationships between environmental features and health outcomes of interest. To systematically study such effects on an individual level, it is helpful to group images into distinct environments encountered in an individual's daily life; these may then be analyzed, further grouped into related environments with similar features, and linked to health outcomes. Here we introduce infinite hierarchical contrastive clustering to address this challenge. Building on the established contrastive clustering framework, our method a) allows an arbitrary number of clusters without requiring the full Dirichlet Process machinery by placing a stick-breaking prior on predicted cluster probabilities; and b) encourages distinct environments to form well-defined sub-clusters within each cluster of related environments by incorporating a participant-specific prediction loss. Our experiments show that our model effectively identifies distinct personal environments and groups these environments into meaningful environment types. We then illustrate how the resulting clusters can be linked to various health outcomes, highlighting the potential of our approach to advance the envirotyping paradigm.

Abstract: This work demonstrates an airflow inertial based odometry system with multi-sensor data fusion, including thermal anemometer, IMU, ESC, and barometer. This goal is challenging because low-cost IMUs and barometers have significant bias, and anemometer measurements are very susceptible to interference from spinning propellers and ground effects. We employ a GRU-based deep neural network to estimate relative air speed from noisy and disturbed anemometer measurements, and an observer with bias model to fuse the sensor data and thus estimate the state of aerial vehicle. A complete flight data, including takeoff and landing on the ground, shows that the approach is able to decouple the downwash induced wind speed caused by propellers and the ground effect, and accurately estimate the flight speed in a wind-free indoor environment. IMU, and barometer bias are effectively estimated, which significantly reduces the position integration drift, which is only 5.7m for 203s manual random flight. The open source is available on https://github.com/SyRoCo-ISIR/Flight-Speed-Estimation-Airflow.

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended, interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use, supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

Abstract: Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges, their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images, highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.

Abstract: Effective cross-lingual transfer remains a critical challenge in scaling the benefits of large language models from high-resource to low-resource languages. Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned. These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning. In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs. We evaluate DeFT-X on a diverse set of extremely low-resource languages for sentiment classification (NusaX) and natural language inference (AmericasNLI) and demonstrate that it performs at par or outperforms SFT and other prominent cross-lingual transfer baselines.

Abstract: Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that maximizes desired quantitative properties in a combinatorially large design space of possible sequences. Recent developments in steering protein generative models (e.g diffusion models, language models) offer a promising approach. However, by and large, past studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization campaigns where fitness is measured by low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance strategies offer advantages compared to alternatives such as reinforcement learning with protein language models.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades, and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation have emphasized the importance of decoupling different knowledge components. While existing methods utilize momentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they overlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class knowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses, following curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters low-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively purifying dark knowledge during early training. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO demonstrate DeepKD's effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/haiduo/DeepKD.

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&amp;D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.

Abstract: Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including navigation and manipulation.

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks in machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that the Hessian with respect to the input serves as a diagnostic tool for detecting poisoning, exhibiting spectral signatures that characterize compromised datasets. We use random matrix theory (RMT) to develop a theory for the impact of poisoning proportion and regularisation on attack efficacy in linear regression. Through QR stepwise regression, we study the spectral signatures of the Hessian in multi-output regression. We perform experiments on deep networks to show experimentally that this theory extends to modern convolutional and transformer networks under the cross-entropy loss. Based on these insights we develop preliminary algorithms to determine if a network has been poisoned and remedies which do not require further training.

<title>ReflAct: World-Grounded Decision Making in LLM Agents via Goal-State Reflection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15182</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.

Abstract: Automated epileptic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) remains challenging due to significant individual differences in EEG patterns across patients. While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific approaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address this, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features through domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy while minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution patterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy demonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high detection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial training with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.

Abstract: Data fusion, the process of combining observational and experimental data, can enable the identification of causal effects that would otherwise remain non-identifiable. Although identification algorithms have been developed for specific scenarios, do-calculus remains the only general-purpose tool for causal data fusion, particularly when variables are present in some data sources but not others. However, approaches based on do-calculus may encounter computational challenges as the number of variables increases and the causal graph grows in complexity. Consequently, there exists a need to reduce the size of such models while preserving the essential features. For this purpose, we propose pruning (removing unnecessary variables) and clustering (combining variables) as preprocessing operations for causal data fusion. We generalize earlier results on a single data source and derive conditions for applying pruning and clustering in the case of multiple data sources. We give sufficient conditions for inferring the identifiability or non-identifiability of a causal effect in a larger graph based on a smaller graph and show how to obtain the corresponding identifying functional for identifiable causal effects. Examples from epidemiology and social science demonstrate the use of the results.

<title>BountyBench: Dollar Impact of AI Agent Attackers and Defenders on Real-World Cybersecurity Systems</title>

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of 40-67.5% and Patch scores of 45-60%.

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG) signals recorded from the skin surface enable intuitive control of assistive devices such as prosthetic limbs. However, in EMG-based motion recognition, collecting comprehensive training data for all target motions remains challenging, particularly for complex combined motions. This paper proposes a method to efficiently recognize combined motions using synthetic EMG data generated through convex combinations of basic motion patterns. Instead of measuring all possible combined motions, the proposed method utilizes measured basic motion data along with synthetically combined motion data for training. This approach expands the range of recognizable combined motions while minimizing the required training data collection. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method through an upper limb motion classification experiment with eight subjects. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy for unseen combined motions by approximately 17%.

Abstract: A new machine learning scheme, termed versatile reservoir computing, is proposed for sustaining the dynamics of heterogeneous complex networks. We show that a single, small-scale reservoir computer trained on time series from a subset of elements is able to replicate the dynamics of any element in a large-scale complex network, though the elements are of different intrinsic parameters and connectivities. Furthermore, by substituting failed elements with the trained machine, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics of the network can be preserved accurately over a finite time horizon. The capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are validated on three representative network models: a homogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, and a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical chaotic oscillators.

Abstract: This paper explores generalised probabilistic modelling and uncertainty estimation in comparative LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. We show that existing Product-of-Experts methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling diverse modelling options. Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty estimates for individual comparisons, enabling more efficient selection and achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations. We also introduce a method for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate that combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering, significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic model has a notable impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training deep neural networks, particularly in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce. While current approaches typically rely on synthetic augmentations of single images, we propose VET-DINO, a framework that leverages a unique characteristic of medical imaging: the availability of multiple standardized views from the same study. Using a series of clinical veterinary radiographs from the same patient study, we enable models to learn view-invariant anatomical structures and develop an implied 3D understanding from 2D projections. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset of 5 million veterinary radiographs from 668,000 canine studies. Through extensive experimentation, including view synthesis and downstream task performance, we show that learning from real multi-view pairs leads to superior anatomical understanding compared to purely synthetic augmentations. VET-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on various veterinary imaging tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for self-supervised learning in medical imaging that leverages domain-specific properties rather than merely adapting natural image techniques.

Abstract: The wide deployment of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) has raised privacy concerns for both clients and servers. While cryptographic primitives can be employed for secure GPT inference to protect the privacy of both parties, they introduce considerable performance overhead.To accelerate secure inference, this study proposes a public decoding and secure verification approach that utilizes public GPT models, motivated by the observation that securely decoding one and multiple tokens takes a similar latency. The client uses the public model to generate a set of tokens, which are then securely verified by the private model for acceptance. The efficiency of our approach depends on the acceptance ratio of tokens proposed by the public model, which we improve from two aspects: (1) a private sampling protocol optimized for cryptographic primitives and (2) model alignment using knowledge distillation. Our approach improves the efficiency of secure decoding while maintaining the same level of privacy and generation quality as standard secure decoding. Experiments demonstrate a $2.1\times \sim 6.0\times$ speedup compared to standard decoding across three pairs of public-private models and different network conditions.

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs, generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.

Abstract: Oversteer, wherein a vehicle's rear tires lose traction and induce unintentional excessive yaw, poses critical safety challenges. Failing to control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic (QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer control with obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: We study the policy testing problem in discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the fixed-confidence setting. The goal is to determine whether the value of a given policy exceeds a specified threshold while minimizing the number of observations. We begin by deriving an instance-specific lower bound that any algorithm must satisfy. This lower bound is characterized as the solution to an optimization problem with non-convex constraints. We propose a policy testing algorithm inspired by this optimization problem--a common approach in pure exploration problems such as best-arm identification, where asymptotically optimal algorithms often stem from such optimization-based characterizations. As for other pure exploration tasks in MDPs, however, the non-convex constraints in the lower-bound problem present significant challenges, raising doubts about whether statistically optimal and computationally tractable algorithms can be designed. To address this, we reformulate the lower-bound problem by interchanging the roles of the objective and the constraints, yielding an alternative problem with a non-convex objective but convex constraints. Strikingly, this reformulated problem admits an interpretation as a policy optimization task in a newly constructed reversed MDP. Leveraging recent advances in policy gradient methods, we efficiently solve this problem and use it to design a policy testing algorithm that is statistically optimal--matching the instance-specific lower bound on sample complexity--while remaining computationally tractable. We validate our approach with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.

Abstract: In electromyogram (EMG)-based motion recognition, a subject-specific classifier is typically trained with sufficient labeled data. However, this process demands extensive data collection over extended periods, burdening the subject. To address this, utilizing information from pre-training on multiple subjects for the training of the target subject could be beneficial. This paper proposes an inter-subject variance transfer learning method based on a Bayesian approach. This method is founded on the simple hypothesis that while the means of EMG features vary greatly across subjects, their variances may exhibit similar patterns. Our approach transfers variance information, acquired through pre-training on multiple source subjects, to a target subject within a Bayesian updating framework, thereby allowing accurate classification using limited target calibration data. A coefficient was also introduced to adjust the amount of information transferred for efficient transfer learning. Experimental evaluations using two EMG datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our variance transfer strategy and its superiority compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal systems routinely face missing-input scenarios, and in reality, robots lose audio in a factory or a clinical record omits lab tests at inference time. Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1% run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for robust, calibrated multimodal inference.

Abstract: This paper explores Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in SVM predictions, particularly for regression and forecasting tasks. Unlike the Neural Network, the SVM solutions are typically more stable, sparse, optimal and interpretable. However, there are only few literature which addresses the UQ in SVM prediction. At first, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing Prediction Interval (PI) estimation and probabilistic forecasting methods developed in the SVM framework and evaluate them against the key properties expected from an ideal PI model. We find that none of the existing SVM PI models achieves a sparse solution. To introduce sparsity in SVM model, we propose the Sparse Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) model, which constructs PIs and probabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs. Further, we develop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that effectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI quality in case of high-dimensional dataset. Finally we extend the SVM models in Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction set with finite test set guarantees. Extensive experiments on artificial, real-world benchmark datasets compare the different characteristics of both existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation methods and also highlight the advantages of the feature selection in PI estimation. Furthermore, we compare both, the existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation models, with modern deep learning models for probabilistic forecasting tasks on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, SVM models show comparable or superior performance to modern complex deep learning models for probabilistic forecasting task in our experiments.

Abstract: Conformal prediction enables the construction of high-coverage prediction sets for any pre-trained model, guaranteeing that the true label lies within the set with a specified probability. However, these sets do not provide probability estimates for individual labels, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for assigning calibrated probabilities to elements of a conformal prediction set. Our approach frames this as an adaptive calibration problem, selecting an input-specific temperature parameter to match the desired coverage level. Experiments on several challenging image classification datasets demonstrate that our method maintains coverage guarantees while significantly reducing expected calibration error.

Abstract: Recent efforts at scaling computer vision models have established Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the leading architecture. ViTs incorporate weight sharing over image patches as an important inductive bias. In this work, we show that ViTs benefit from incorporating equivariance under the octic group, i.e., reflections and 90-degree rotations, as a further inductive bias. We develop new architectures, octic ViTs, that use octic-equivariant layers and put them to the test on both supervised and self-supervised learning. Through extensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show that octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also improving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in FLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and segmentation results.

Abstract: The paper presents a decision support system for the long-term preservation of aeronautical heritage exhibited/stored in sheltered sites. The aeronautical heritage is characterized by diverse materials of which this heritage is constituted. Heritage aircraft are made of ancient aluminum alloys, (ply)wood, and particularly fabrics. The decision support system (DSS) designed, starting from a conceptual model, is knowledge-based on degradation/corrosion mechanisms of prevailing materials of aeronautical heritage. In the case of historical aircraft wooden parts, this knowledge base is filled in by the damage function models developed within former European projects. Model-based corrosion prediction is implemented within the new DSS for ancient aluminum alloys. The novelty of this DSS consists of supporting multi-material heritage protection and tailoring to peculiarities of aircraft exhibition/storage hangars and the needs of aviation museums. The novel DSS is tested on WWII aircraft heritage exhibited in the Aviation Museum Kbely, Military History Institute Prague, Czech Republic.

<title>Machine Learning Derived Blood Input for Dynamic PET Images of Rat Heart</title>

Abstract: Dynamic FDG PET imaging study of n = 52 rats including 26 control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 26 experimental spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were performed using a Siemens microPET and Albira trimodal scanner longitudinally at 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months of age. A 15-parameter dual output model correcting for spill over contamination and partial volume effects with peak fitting cost functions was developed for simultaneous estimation of model corrected blood input function (MCIF) and kinetic rate constants for dynamic FDG PET images of rat heart in vivo. Major drawbacks of this model are its dependence on manual annotations for the Image Derived Input Function (IDIF) and manual determination of crucial model parameters to compute MCIF. To overcome these limitations, we performed semi-automated segmentation and then formulated a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell network to train and predict MCIF in test data using a concatenation of IDIFs and myocardial inputs and compared them with reference-modeled MCIF. Thresholding along 2D plane slices with two thresholds, with T1 representing high-intensity myocardium, and T2 representing lower-intensity rings, was used to segment the area of the LV blood pool. The resultant IDIF and myocardial TACs were used to compute the corresponding reference (model) MCIF for all data sets. The segmented IDIF and the myocardium formed the input for the LSTM network. A k-fold cross validation structure with a 33:8:11 split and 5 folds was utilized to create the model and evaluate the performance of the LSTM network for all datasets. To overcome the sparseness of data as time steps increase, midpoint interpolation was utilized to increase the density of datapoints beyond time = 10 minutes. The model utilizing midpoint interpolation was able to achieve a 56.4% improvement over previous Mean Squared Error (MSE).

<title>Coloring Between the Lines: Personalization in the Null Space of Planning Constraints</title>

Abstract: Generalist robots must personalize in-the-wild to meet the diverse needs and preferences of long-term users. How can we enable flexible personalization without sacrificing safety or competency? This paper proposes Coloring Between the Lines (CBTL), a method for personalization that exploits the null space of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) used in robot planning. CBTL begins with a CSP generator that ensures safe and competent behavior, then incrementally personalizes behavior by learning parameterized constraints from online interaction. By quantifying uncertainty and leveraging the compositionality of planning constraints, CBTL achieves sample-efficient adaptation without environment resets. We evaluate CBTL in (1) three diverse simulation environments; (2) a web-based user study; and (3) a real-robot assisted feeding system, finding that CBTL consistently achieves more effective personalization with fewer interactions than baselines. Our results demonstrate that CBTL provides a unified and practical approach for continual, flexible, active, and safe robot personalization. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/cbtl/

<title>Prompt Tuning Vision Language Models with Margin Regularizer for Few-Shot Learning under Distribution Shifts</title>

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer. Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets, with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art approaches applied to this setting. github.com/debarshigit/PromptMargin.

<title>Robo2VLM: Visual Question Answering from Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Datasets</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot, task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions - based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

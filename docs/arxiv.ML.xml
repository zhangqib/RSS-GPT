Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based single-channel speech separation has improved considerably, in large part driven by increasingly compute- and parameter-efficient neural network architectures. Most such architectures are, however, designed with a fixed compute and parameter budget, and consequently cannot scale to varying compute demands or resources, which limits their use in embedded and heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones and hearables. To enable such use-cases we design a neural network architecture for speech separation capable of early-exit, and we propose an uncertainty-aware probabilistic framework to jointly model the clean speech signal and error variance which we use to derive probabilistic early-exit conditions in terms of desired signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate our methods on both speech separation and enhancement tasks, and we show that a single early-exit model can be competitive with state-of-the-art models trained at many compute and parameter budgets. Our framework enables fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling of speech separation networks while achieving state-of-the-art performance and interpretable exit conditions.

Summary:  
synthetic data augmentation approach Iceberg improves generalizability of deep learning-based prediction models for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) of hardware designs. Iceberg pretrains on synthetic data, expands large language model (LLM)-generated programs, and improves weak label generation for unseen design configurations. Integrated with an in-context model architecture, Iceberg enables meta-learning from actual and proximate labels. Iceberg significantly enhances modeling accuracy by 86.4% when adapting to real-world applications with few-shot examples. It also achieves a 2.47x and 1.12x improvement in offline DSE performance when adapting to different test datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning-based prediction models for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) of hardware designs often struggle to generalize. In this paper, we study how to close the generalizability gap of these models through pretraining on synthetic data and introduce Iceberg, a synthetic data augmentation approach that expands both large language model (LLM)-generated programs and weak labels of unseen design configurations. Our weak label generation method is integrated with an in-context model architecture, enabling meta-learning from actual and proximate labels. Iceberg improves the geometric mean modeling accuracy by $86.4\%$ when adapt to six real-world applications with few-shot examples and achieves a $2.47\times$ and a $1.12\times$ better offline DSE performance when adapting to two different test datasets.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a domain-adaptive small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for predicting product and service tax codes in compliance with tax regulations. This approach focuses on accurately determining hierarchical tax code sequences from unstructured data, demonstrating the effectiveness of encoder-decoder SLMs in predicting structured tax codes. The experiments show superior performance of the proposed approach over flat classifiers, especially for Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes. The encoder-decoder architecture captures hierarchical dependencies within tax codes, outperforming decoder-only and encoder-only models. The model can be adapted to predict other government-mandated tax commodity codes such as the United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC) or Brazil's Nomenclatura Comum do Mercosul (NCM). This research contributes to advancing NLP applications in tax compliance and structured sequence generation tasks. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura Comum do Mercosul (NCM).

Summary:
Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO) is introduced as an on-policy algorithm that combines the benefits of pathwise policy gradients with the simplicity of on-policy learning. It addresses the high training variance of score-function policy gradients by focusing on accurate value function training solely from on-policy data. The algorithm strikes a balance between stochastic policies for exploration and constrained policy updates for stability during training. By leveraging key architectural components for value function learning, REPPO achieves strong empirical performance with decreased sample requirements, reduced wall-clock time, minimal memory usage, and high hyperparameter robustness. The method is evaluated on standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in various settings. <div>

Abstract: Score-function policy gradients have delivered strong results in game-playing, robotics and language-model fine-tuning. Yet its high-variance often undermines training stability. On the other hand, pathwise policy gradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by an accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to train without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to construct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training Q-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to balance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that facilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we propose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient on-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard on-policy learning. We demonstrate that REPPO provides strong empirical performance at decreased sample requirements, wall-clock time, memory footprint as well as high hyperparameter robustness in a set of experiments on two standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks.

Summary: 
Simulation-based inference methods are becoming increasingly important in the field of gravitational wave astronomy due to the complex nature of the data. These methods, which utilize machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation, offer a promising alternative to traditional Bayesian inference methods. They have the potential to provide rapid and detailed parameter estimation, as well as facilitate population-level analyses. However, challenges such as model-dependence and sensitivity to prior assumptions need to be addressed before widespread adoption. While these methods show speed improvements in controlled studies, their accuracy and reliability across various noise conditions and parameter spaces require further validation. Overall, simulation-based inference methods offer a new avenue for tackling the computational challenges posed by the high-dimensional parameter spaces in gravitational wave data processing.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.

<div> Keywords: structured pruning, deep neural networks, regularization, Catalyst Pruning algorithm, model performance

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Catalyst Pruning algorithm for structured pruning in deep neural networks. Traditional pruning methods tend to bias decisions based on filter magnitudes, leading to suboptimal results. Catalyst Pruning addresses this issue by ensuring fair pruning chances for all filters, unbiased by magnitude. The algorithm introduces a novel regularization technique defined in an extended parameter space using auxiliary catalyst variables. This approach guarantees robust pruning behavior with a wide-margin separation between preserved and pruned filters, minimizing the risk of perturbations affecting pruning decisions. Empirical validations demonstrate the superiority of Catalyst Pruning over existing filter pruning methods in terms of performance and fairness. The algorithm's theoretical properties align with its real-world effectiveness, showcasing its potential for practical applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep neural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional regularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to magnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes are likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost zero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a filter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the precise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model performance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in an extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed Catalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with theoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior achieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the pruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world effectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm. Pruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art filter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and fair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.

<div> Keywords: neural network compression, structured pruning, importance-based approach, projective space, PROscore

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel structured pruning strategy called IPPRO that challenges the dominance of magnitude-based importance criteria in neural network compression. By placing filters in projective space, IPPRO allows for a fair chance for each filter to be pruned, regardless of its magnitude. This approach measures the movement of filters towards the origin during gradient descent to determine their likelihood of being pruned, resulting in the PROscore importance score. Evaluation results demonstrate that IPPRO achieves near-lossless pruning with reduced performance drop and promising outcomes after finetuning. This work dispels the misconception that filter size is the most important factor in pruning and advances the field of importance-based pruning both theoretically and empirically. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of demand on neural network compression methods, the structured pruning methods including importance-based approach are actively studied. The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance criteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with larger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even if it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning, with promising performance after the finetuning. Our work debunks the ``size-matters'' myth in pruning and expands the frontier of importance-based pruning both theoretically and empirically.

Summary:
SOAR is a method proposed for program synthesis that combines evolutionary search with language models in a self-improving loop. It alternates between an evolutionary search using a language model to refine solutions and a hindsight learning phase to fine-tune the language model based on past search attempts. This integration leads to significant performance gains on the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, with improved results across different model scales and iterations. The positive transfer between sampling and refinement tasks enhances the effectiveness of the search process. Test-time adaptation is also improved, with SOAR able to solve 52% of the public test set. The code for SOAR is open-sourced and available on GitHub at https://github.com/flowersteam/SOAR. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many program synthesis tasks prove too challenging for even state-of-the-art language models to solve in single attempts. Search-based evolutionary methods offer a promising alternative by exploring solution spaces iteratively, but their effectiveness remain limited by the fixed capabilities of the underlying generative model.
  We propose SOAR, a method that learns program synthesis by integrating language models into a self-improving evolutionary loop.
  SOAR alternates between (1) an evolutionary search that uses an LLM to sample and refine candidate solutions, and (2) a hindsight learning phase that converts search attempts into valid problem-solution pairs used to fine-tune the LLM's sampling and refinement capabilities\, -- \,enabling increasingly effective search in subsequent iterations.
  On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, SOAR achieves significant performance gains across model scales and iterations, leveraging positive transfer between the sampling and refinement finetuning tasks. These improvements carry over to test-time adaptation, enabling SOAR to solve 52\% of the public test set. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flowersteam/SOAR

Summary:
Latent space fusion, a method for integrating multiple data modalities, was evaluated for predicting daily depressive symptoms in mental health using data from the BRIGHTEN clinical trial. Compared to traditional methods like Random Forest and Linear Regression, the Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network outperformed in terms of accuracy, with lower mean squared error and higher coefficient of determination. The CM showed consistent generalization and better performance when integrating all data modalities, emphasizing the importance of capturing non-linear interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. This study suggests that latent space fusion offers a more robust approach for prediction with multimodal mental health data and highlights the potential for improved early detection and personalized intervention for mental illnesses. Future research could focus on model interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved methods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional predictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that fail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced integration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer better accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN clinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting daily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented with a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset included behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features. Experiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream combinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and Linear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985 vs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed signs of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance, while the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when integrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF), underscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion offers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with multimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.

<div> Keywords: Artificial intelligence, Predictive Representativity, Algorithmic bias, Fairness auditing, Healthcare

Summary: 
This paper introduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR) as a framework for fairness auditing in AI systems used in healthcare decision-making. The focus shifts from the composition of the dataset to outcomes-level equity. The study conducted in dermatology evaluated AI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on different datasets, revealing performance disparities by skin phototype, especially for individuals with darker skin. The concept of representativity is dynamic and context-sensitive, quantifying how models generalize fairness across subpopulations. An External Transportability Criterion is proposed to formalize thresholds for fairness generalization. The findings emphasize the ethical need for post-hoc fairness auditing, dataset transparency, and inclusive model validation processes in AI healthcare systems. This work provides a scalable tool for identifying structural inequities in AI systems, contributing to discussions on equity, interpretability, and data justice to promote a reassessment of fairness in data-driven healthcare.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly inform medical decision-making, yet concerns about algorithmic bias and inequitable outcomes persist, particularly for historically marginalized populations. This paper introduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of fairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to outcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated AI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset and on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our analysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with classifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin, despite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that representativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as a dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes this shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across subpopulations and deployment contexts. We further propose an External Transportability Criterion that formalizes the thresholds for fairness generalization. Our findings highlight the ethical imperative for post-hoc fairness auditing, transparency in dataset documentation, and inclusive model validation pipelines. This work offers a scalable tool for diagnosing structural inequities in AI systems, contributing to discussions on equity, interpretability, and data justice and fostering a critical re-evaluation of fairness in data-driven healthcare.

Summary:
This paper investigates the training solution of two-layer neural networks with a hidden layer composed of units with smooth activation functions. The approach involves constructing Taylor series expansions, setting a strict partial order of knots, implementing smooth splines, and enforcing smooth continuity restrictions. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is proven, shedding light on the previously mysterious "black box" of the solution space. Experimental verification supports the theoretical findings, offering insight into the mechanisms underlying neural network training.

Abstract: This paper aims to understand the training solution, which is obtained by the back-propagation algorithm, of two-layer neural networks whose hidden layer is composed of the units with smooth activation functions, including the usual sigmoid type most commonly used before the advent of ReLUs. The mechanism contains four main principles: construction of Taylor series expansions, strict partial order of knots, smooth-spline implementation and smooth-continuity restriction. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is proved and experimental verification is given, through which the mystery of ``black box'' of the solution space is largely revealed. The new proofs employed also enrich approximation theory.

<div> distance-based score functions, out-of-distribution detection, deep learning, Feature Bank Enhancement, extreme features 

Summary:
Feature Bank Enhancement (FBE) is proposed to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in deep learning applications. FBE uses statistical characteristics to identify and constrain extreme features to separation boundaries, increasing the distance between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. This helps counter the bias in distance-based methods that assign low scores to ID samples due to extreme features. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that FBE achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection. The method enhances the differentiation between ID and OOD samples, improving the overall reliability of deep learning applications. Theoretical analysis and supplementary experiments provide further insights into the effectiveness of FBE in enhancing OOD detection capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2507.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability of deep learning applications and has attracted significant attention in recent years. A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score functions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low scores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these methods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their efficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased distribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These extreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores to ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Bank Enhancement (FBE), that uses statistical characteristics from dataset to identify and constrain extreme features to the separation boundaries, therapy making the distance between samples inside and outside the distribution farther. We conducted experiments on large-scale ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10 respectively, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmark. Additionally, theoretical analysis and supplementary experiments are conducted to provide more insights into our method.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, activation sparsity, clustering, computational efficiency, prediction

Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, with only a subset of neurons being active for a given input. To efficiently utilize this sparsity, a clustering-based activation pattern compression framework is proposed. This framework groups similar activation patterns into representative clusters, achieving high clustering precision of up to 79.34%. The approach outperforms standard binary clustering methods while maintaining minimal degradation in perplexity scores. With a large number of clusters, the method attains a low perplexity score of 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids. The clustering algorithm's effectiveness in capturing meaningful activation structures shows great potential to improve sparse computation efficiency in large-scale language models. This work lays the groundwork for efficient inference in LLMs through activation pattern prediction. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently, we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids. We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for efficient inference in large-scale language models.

<div> Keywords: explainable AI, millimeter-wave systems, deep learning, beam alignment, spectral efficiency

Summary:
This paper introduces a deep learning-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for millimeter-wave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, addressing the challenges of high data collection overhead, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to attacks. The BAE leverages received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements to predict the best narrow beam, reducing beam sweeping overhead. By using a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate synthetic channel data and transfer learning for model refinement, the framework minimizes the need for real-world data. Deep Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) are employed to prioritize key spatial directions and minimize beam sweeping, while the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm provides credibility metrics for transparent decision-making and outlier detection. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in data and beam training overhead, improved outlier detection robustness, and near-optimal spectral efficiency compared to traditional deep learning models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In line with the AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness are crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable performance in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but deep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection overhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of exhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data collection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate synthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model refinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model residing in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging mismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce beam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance, prioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also incorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a credibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring robust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead by 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving near-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to traditional softmax based DL models.

<div> Keywords: Intelligent fault diagnosis, semi-supervised federated learning, dual contrastive loss, soft labeling, user privacy

Summary: 
The paper introduces a semi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, to address the challenges of data and label scarcity in intelligent fault diagnosis. By integrating dual contrastive loss and soft labeling, the framework allows representation learning using unlabeled data and promotes joint learning among distributed clients. A sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is designed to improve the quality of pseudo labels in the training process. The dual contrastive loss helps mitigate model divergence due to different data distributions, while local prototypes facilitate knowledge sharing among clients. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSFL-DCSL in improving accuracy, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. By achieving mutual knowledge sharing and preserving user privacy, the framework offers a promising approach for robust fault diagnosis in industrial machinery. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial machinery and improving production efficiency. However, traditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training data and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally, the cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire. Meanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the model's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a semi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual contrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for distributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy. It enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and facilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving mutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically, first, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is designed to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the semi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced to mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising local contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are aggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to share knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework, experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset collected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only 10\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by 1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods.

<div> regime, market dynamics, investor behavior, bias, trend prediction
Summary:
The paper studies the impact of investor-driven market dynamics on financial markets, considering historical price trajectories and external narratives. It introduces the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), which incorporates temporal price sequences and external signals to capture bias variations and behavioral adaptation. The model leverages a shared latent space to represent opposing bull and bear forces, enabling the modeling of bias-driven asymmetry and market heterogeneity. It includes inertial pairing and dual competition mechanisms to preserve momentum and capture behavioral divergence. The experimental results on real-world financial datasets show that the B4 model outperforms existing approaches in predicting market trends and offers valuable insights into the interplay of biases, investor behaviors, and market dynamics. <div>

Abstract: Financial markets exhibit highly dynamic and complex behaviors shaped by both historical price trajectories and exogenous narratives, such as news, policy interpretations, and social media sentiment. The heterogeneity in these data and the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the modeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the potential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through empirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic relationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances trend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we propose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified framework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual signals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces naturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this space, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve momentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish embeddings to capture behavioral divergence. Together, these components allow B4 to model bias-driven asymmetry, behavioral inertia, and market heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets demonstrate that our model not only achieves superior performance in predicting market trends but also provides interpretable insights into the interplay of biases, investor behaviors, and market dynamics.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Key-Value pairs, LaCache, long-range capabilities, generative inference

Summary:
LaCache is a novel Key-Value cache optimization paradigm designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing the challenges of processing extensive input contexts and generating continuous outputs efficiently. It introduces a ladder-shaped cache pattern that enhances the model's long-range capabilities by storing KV pairs both sequentially and across layers. This innovation allows LLMs to capture long-range dependencies within a fixed storage budget effectively. LaCache also includes an iterative compaction mechanism that dynamically compresses older caches, enabling more efficient continuous generation under limited cache constraints. Experiments across various tasks confirm LaCache's success in improving LLM performance. The code for implementing LaCache is available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for further research and development in this area.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/LaCache.

Abstract: This study aims to develop a deep learning system for an accessibility device for the deaf or hearing impaired. The device will accurately localize and identify sound sources in real time. This study will fill an important gap in current research by leveraging machine learning techniques to target the underprivileged community. The system includes three main components. 1. JerryNet: A custom designed CNN architecture that determines the direction of arrival (DoA) for nine possible directions. 2. Audio Classification: This model is based on fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to identify the exact sound classes only based on audio. 3. Multimodal integration model: This is an accurate sound localization model that combines audio, visual, and text data to locate the exact sound sources in the images. The part consists of two modules, one object detection using Yolov9 to generate all the bounding boxes of the objects, and an audio visual localization model to identify the optimal bounding box using complete Intersection over Union (CIoU). The hardware consists of a four-microphone rectangular formation and a camera mounted on glasses with a wristband for displaying necessary information like direction. On a custom collected data set, JerryNet achieved a precision of 91. 1% for the sound direction, outperforming all the baseline models. The CLAP model achieved 98.5% and 95% accuracy on custom and AudioSet datasets, respectively. The audio-visual localization model within component 3 yielded a cIoU of 0.892 and an AUC of 0.658, surpassing other similar models. There are many future potentials to this study, paving the way to creating a new generation of accessibility devices.

arXiv:2507.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering, supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively. Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.

<div> Proposed Method, Gradient-Based Domain Generalization, Pareto Optimality, Gradient Matching, Meta-Learner <br />
<br />
Summary: In addressing the gradient-based domain generalization problem, this study introduces a new approach called Pareto Optimality Gradient Matching (POGM). Unlike existing methods that use gradient matching as regularization, POGM utilizes gradient trajectories as collected data and conducts independent training at the meta-learner level. By maximizing Gradient Inner Products (GIP) and ensuring the learned gradients stay close to the empirical risk minimization trajectory, POGM enables consistent gradient directions across multiple domains without experiencing fluctuations. Experimental results on DomainBed datasets show that POGM achieves competitive performance compared to other baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2507.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the gradient-based domain generalization problem, where predictors aim for consistent gradient directions across different domains. Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of gradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient fluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second, the direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can incur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient Matching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient matching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data and apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we maximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from the empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory. By doing so, the aggregate gradient can incorporate knowledge from all domains without suffering gradient fluctuation towards any particular domain. Experimental evaluations on datasets from DomainBed demonstrate competitive results yielded by POGM against other baselines while achieving computational efficiency.

Summary: 
The Linearized Diffusion Map (LDM) is a new linear dimensionality reduction technique that combines the geometric insight of diffusion-based nonlinear methods with the computational simplicity of linear embeddings like PCA. In experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks, LDM was shown to capture distinct geometric features of datasets compared to PCA. LDM outperformed PCA in datasets with explicit manifold structures, especially in high-dimensional settings, while PCA was more effective in scenarios dominated by variance or noise. Additionally, LDM's kernel matrix's complete positivity enables direct application of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), allowing for interpretable latent-structure discovery. Therefore, LDM is a valuable new linear dimensionality reduction method with potential theoretical and practical extensions.

Abstract: We introduce the Linearized Diffusion Map (LDM), a novel linear dimensionality reduction method constructed via a linear approximation of the diffusion-map kernel. LDM integrates the geometric intuition of diffusion-based nonlinear methods with the computational simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability inherent in linear embeddings such as PCA and classical MDS. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic datasets (Swiss roll and hyperspheres) and real-world benchmarks (MNIST and COIL-20), we illustrate that LDM captures distinct geometric features of datasets compared to PCA, offering complementary advantages. Specifically, LDM embeddings outperform PCA in datasets exhibiting explicit manifold structures, particularly in high-dimensional regimes, whereas PCA remains preferable in scenarios dominated by variance or noise. Furthermore, the complete positivity of LDM's kernel matrix allows direct applicability of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), suggesting opportunities for interpretable latent-structure discovery. Our analysis positions LDM as a valuable new linear dimensionality reduction technique with promising theoretical and practical extensions.

Summary: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) face challenges in reflecting on their reasoning and revising answers in multi-turn problem solving. Existing RL methods often lead to repetitive responses and struggles in answering across multiple turns. To address this, the study introduces Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for RL training, using minimal unary feedback to improve single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. The experimental results show that training with UFO enhances multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%. Moreover, the study designs reward structures to guide models in producing careful and deliberate answers, minimizing the number of turns needed for correct responses. By incorporating UFO into existing RL setups, language models can better react to feedback in multi-turn problem-solving scenarios. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

Summary:
FedStrategist introduces a meta-learning framework for Federated Learning to address vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks in decentralized AI systems. It reframes robust aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem and designs a contextual bandit agent to dynamically select the optimal aggregation rule based on real-time diagnostic metrics. The adaptive agent successfully learns superior policies across diverse scenarios and prioritizes model integrity even in scenarios where compromised accuracy is high. The agent's policy is controllable via a single "risk tolerance" parameter, allowing practitioners to manage the trade-off between performance and security effectively. This novel approach provides a practical and analyzable method for creating resilient and intelligent decentralized AI systems. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative AI, but its decentralized nature creates significant vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks. While numerous static defenses exist, their effectiveness is highly context-dependent, often failing against adaptive adversaries or in heterogeneous data environments. This paper introduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that no single static rule is universally optimal. We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns superior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable" environment and against a sophisticated "stealth" adversary designed to neutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical scenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy, and demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model integrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a single "risk tolerance" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between performance and security. Our work provides a new, practical, and analyzable approach to creating resilient and intelligent decentralized AI systems.

Summary: 
This study explores the issue of fairness in deepfake detection, identifying a gap in ensuring individual fairness. While previous research has focused on group-level fairness, this work reveals that the original principle of individual fairness is inadequate in the context of deepfake detection. To address this gap, the researchers propose a novel framework that enhances individual fairness and generalization in existing deepfake detectors. Through extensive experiments on prominent deepfake datasets, the framework is shown to significantly improve individual fairness without compromising detection performance, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. The code for implementing this framework is openly available, offering a valuable resource for advancing fairness in deepfake detection systems.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models have substantially improved the realism of synthetic media, yet their misuse through sophisticated DeepFakes poses significant risks. Despite recent advances in deepfake detection, fairness remains inadequately addressed, enabling deepfake markers to exploit biases against specific populations. While previous studies have emphasized group-level fairness, individual fairness (i.e., ensuring similar predictions for similar individuals) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify for the first time that the original principle of individual fairness fundamentally fails in the context of deepfake detection, revealing a critical gap previously unexplored in the literature. To mitigate it, we propose the first generalizable framework that can be integrated into existing deepfake detectors to enhance individual fairness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on leading deepfake datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves individual fairness while maintaining robust detection performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) is an essential component of safety analysis in pressurized and boiling water reactors. To support reliable prediction of this quantity, several empirical correlations and lookup tables have been constructed from physical experiments over the past several decades. With the onset of accessible machine learning (ML) frameworks, multiple initiatives have been established with the goal of predicting CHF more accurately than these traditional methods. While purely data-driven surrogate modeling has been extensively investigated, these approaches lack interpretability, lack resilience to data scarcity, and have been developed mostly using data from tube experiments. As a result, bias-correction hybrid approaches have become increasingly popular, which correct initial "low-fidelity" estimates provided by deterministic base models by using ML-predicted residuals. This body of work has mostly considered round tube geometries; annular geometry-specific ML models have not yet been deployed in thermal hydraulic codes. This study developed, deployed, and validated four ML models to predict CHF in annular geometries using the CTF subchannel code. Three empirical correlation models, Biasi, Bowring, and Katto, were used as base models for comparison. The ML models were trained and tested using 577 experimental annulus data points from four datasets: Becker, Beus, Janssen, and Mortimore. Baseline CHF predictions were obtained from the empirical correlations, with mean relative errors above 26%. The ML-driven models achieved mean relative errors below 3.5%, with no more than one point exceeding the 10% error envelope. In all cases, the hybrid ML models significantly outperformed their empirical counterparts.

Summary: 
- Language models are often fine-tuned through reinforcement learning to modify their behavior or acquire new capabilities.
- Datasets used for fine-tuning, especially human preference datasets, can contain noise.
- Influence functions approximations can be used to detect and prune harmful training examples, particularly in small post-training datasets with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
- The TL;DR dataset for reward model training was adapted to demonstrate the use of influence functions for dataset filtering.
- Filtered datasets using influence functions showed a slight retraining accuracy improvement of 1.5% after removing 10% of training examples. Additionally, gradient similarity was found to be more effective than influence functions in identifying helpful training examples, suggesting the importance of local curvature in detecting harmful examples but less so in detecting helpful ones.

Abstract: Language models are commonly fine-tuned via reinforcement learning to alter their behavior or elicit new capabilities. Datasets used for these purposes, and particularly human preference datasets, are often noisy. The relatively small size post-training datasets, combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, enable the use of influence functions approximations to detect and prune training examples that are harmful to performance on a validation set. In this work, we adapt the TL;DR dataset for reward model training to demonstrate how conjugate-gradient approximated influence functions can be used to filter datasets. In our experiments, influence function filtering yields a small retraining accuracy uplift of 1.5% after removing 10% of training examples. We also show that gradient similarity outperforms influence functions for detecting helpful training examples. This suggests that local curvature is important for detecting harmful training examples, but less so for identifying helpful examples.

<br />
Summary: 
Solo Connection is a new method for adapting Large Language Models like GPT2 for new tasks, outperforming existing approaches like LoRA. It operates at the decoder-block level, reducing trainable parameters significantly while maintaining performance. Inspired by homotopy theory, Solo Connection uses a trainable linear transformation to gradually interpolate between a zero vector and task-specific representation for smooth adaptation. The method introduces long skip connections between decoder blocks, enhancing the model's ability to adapt and leverage pre-trained knowledge in larger LLM architectures. This innovative approach addresses the need to rethink skip connections during fine-tuning, particularly in models with multiple decoder blocks. <div>
arXiv:2507.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation, enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks, subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

<br />
Summary: INCADET is a framework designed for real-time cyberattack detection in critical infrastructures. It addresses the limitations of traditional anomaly detection methods by dynamically capturing evolving system behavior through incremental causal graph learning. The framework consists of three modules: Early Symptom Detection, Incremental Causal Graph Learning, and Causal Graph Classification. By leveraging experience replay and edge reinforcement, INCADET continually refines causal structures while preserving prior knowledge, enabling adaptability to dynamic shifts in data distribution without the need for retraining. Using Graph Convolutional Networks, it accurately classifies system status using the learned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical infrastructure datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability of INCADET compared to static causal and deep temporal baselines in evolving attack scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures poses serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that effectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving attack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often suffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to high data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent research has explored modeling causal relationships among system components. However, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches that require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time settings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability to adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the risk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework for incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack detection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by incrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The framework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects transitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions across sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning: Leverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal structures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification: Employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the learned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical infrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal baselines in evolving attack scenarios.

<div> Keywords: test-time scaling, model distillation, maximum length enforcement, fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1

Summary:
Simple test-time scaling method was proposed to replicate the scaling behavior of o1-like models by manually controlling test-time compute. The analysis revealed that scaling down by enforcing a maximum length primarily contributes to the scaling behavior. Fine-tuning on long CoT data from o1-like models did not significantly affect scaling behavior, and scaling up by appending "Wait" led to inconsistencies. O1-like models, such as DeepSeek-R1, naturally scale up test-time compute during reinforcement learning, surpassing peak performance. In contrast, simple test-time scaling limits model performance as it scales down. Replicating o1 models' test-time scaling can be achieved by scaling down, but the key goal is to unlock higher performance, not just reproduce the scaling behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior, and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models, such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down, it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve -- rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.

Summary: 
This work focuses on utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) with intervention models to tackle large-scale stochastic optimization problems. The approach involves simulating and combining stochastic processes using pre-trained deep learning (DL) models to enhance exploration of the solution space. The study applies this methodology to the multi-sourcing multi-period inventory management problem in supply chain optimization, employing deep RL models for learning and forecasting stochastic supply chain processes. A constraint coordination mechanism is introduced to forecast dual costs considering cross-product constraints in the inventory network. By breaking down supply chain processes into scalable DL modules instead of directly incorporating complex physical constraints into the RL optimization problem, the approach demonstrates improved performance on large real-world datasets. It also identifies open research avenues to further explore the effectiveness of such models.

Abstract: In this work, we study how to efficiently apply reinforcement learning (RL) for solving large-scale stochastic optimization problems by leveraging intervention models. The key of the proposed methodology is to better explore the solution space by simulating and composing the stochastic processes using pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate our approach on a challenging real-world application, the multi-sourcing multi-period inventory management problem in supply chain optimization. In particular, we employ deep RL models for learning and forecasting the stochastic supply chain processes under a range of assumptions. Moreover, we also introduce a constraint coordination mechanism, designed to forecast dual costs given the cross-products constraints in the inventory network. We highlight that instead of directly modeling the complex physical constraints into the RL optimization problem and solving the stochastic problem as a whole, our approach breaks down those supply chain processes into scalable and composable DL modules, leading to improved performance on large real-world datasets. We also outline open problems for future research to further investigate the efficacy of such models.

<div> Graph neural networks (GNN), ReDiSC, node classification, joint distribution, structured predictions <br />
<br />Summary:
The article introduces ReDiSC, a novel approach for structured node classification that considers the correlation among node labels in graphs. ReDiSC utilizes a reparameterized masked diffusion model learned through variational expectation-maximization. It outperforms existing models by efficiently estimating joint label distribution and linking to popular GNN and label propagation methods. The proposed model addresses the limitations of traditional GNNs in capturing correlated node labels. ReDiSC's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on graphs of varying sizes, showing superior performance in homophilic and heterophilic settings. The scalability of ReDiSC to large-scale datasets highlights its practical advantage over existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved unprecedented successes in node classification tasks. Although GNNs inherently encode specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation, and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured node classification tasks.

Abstract: We investigate a Federated Reinforcement Learning with Environment Heterogeneity (FRL-EH) framework, where local environments exhibit statistical heterogeneity. Within this framework, agents collaboratively learn a global policy by aggregating their collective experiences while preserving the privacy of their local trajectories. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a robust FRL-EH framework by presenting a novel global objective function. This function is specifically designed to optimize a global policy that ensures robust performance across heterogeneous local environments and their plausible perturbations. We propose a tabular FRL algorithm named FedRQ and theoretically prove its asymptotic convergence to an optimal policy for the global objective function. Furthermore, we extend FedRQ to environments with continuous state space through the use of expectile loss, addressing the key challenge of minimizing a value function over a continuous subset of the state space. This advancement facilitates the seamless integration of the principles of FedRQ with various Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL algorithms. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness and robustness of our FRL algorithms across diverse heterogeneous environments, consistently achieving superior performance over the existing state-of-the-art FRL algorithms.

Abstract: Many critical decision-making tasks are now delegated to machine-learned models, and it is imperative that their decisions are trustworthy and reliable, and their outputs are consistent across similar inputs. We identify a new source of unreliable behaviors-called glitches-which may significantly impair the reliability of AI models having steep decision boundaries. Roughly speaking, glitches are small neighborhoods in the input space where the model's output abruptly oscillates with respect to small changes in the input. We provide a formal definition of glitches, and use well-known models and datasets from the literature to demonstrate that they have widespread existence and argue they usually indicate potential model inconsistencies in the neighborhood of where they are found. We proceed to the algorithmic search of glitches for widely used gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) models. We prove that the problem of detecting glitches is NP-complete for tree ensembles, already for trees of depth 4. Our glitch-search algorithm for GBDT models uses an MILP encoding of the problem, and its effectiveness and computational feasibility are demonstrated on a set of widely used GBDT benchmarks taken from the literature.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation (GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD. Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction} serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data. Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%} on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves \textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

<div> Keywords: Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient, self-supervised representation learning, distance-based objectives, structural fidelity, semantic representation quality<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC) as a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. While most SSL methods use distance-based objectives like mean squared error (MSE), which have limitations in semantic alignment and interpretability, SDSC quantifies structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes. It can be used as a loss function in gradient-based optimization by subtracting it from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function. The study also proposes a hybrid loss formulation combining SDSC with MSE, enhancing stability and preserving amplitude when necessary. Experimental results on forecasting and classification tasks show that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, especially in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. These findings indicate that incorporating structural fidelity in signal representations can enhance semantic representation quality, suggesting structure-aware metrics as effective alternatives to conventional distance-based methods. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of identifying control units in causal inference when randomized experiments are not feasible. It introduces positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework to identify control units from unlabeled data using treated units. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its ability to recover control groups and estimate average treatment effects (ATE) accurately. The study highlights the significance of PU learning in observational studies, especially in fields like earth and agricultural sciences where randomized experiments are challenging. This approach enables the estimation of treatment effects even when control units are not explicitly labeled, making it a valuable tool for quasi-experimental research leveraging available data sources for causal inference purposes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In causal inference, whether through randomized controlled trials or observational studies, access to both treated and control units is essential for estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. When treatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be estimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized settings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and approximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common challenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly labeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To address this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for identifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones, using only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach using both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with diverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various scenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow estimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal sowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show that PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from unlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control group, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value. This work has important implications for observational causal inference, especially in fields where randomized experiments are difficult or costly. In domains such as earth, environmental, and agricultural sciences, it enables a plethora of quasi-experiments by leveraging available earth observation and climate data, particularly when treated units are available but control units are lacking.

<div> maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning, mean-field games, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, infinite-horizon, Lagrangian relaxation

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning for infinite-horizon stationary mean-field games. Unlike previous methods that restrict the reward function to a linear combination of fixed basis functions, this approach models the reward function using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, allowing for rich and potentially nonlinear reward structures to be inferred directly from expert demonstrations. By focusing on infinite-horizon cost structures and utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation, the problem is reformulated as an unconstrained log-likelihood maximization problem, with a solution obtained through gradient ascent. The algorithm's theoretical consistency is demonstrated by establishing the smoothness of the log-likelihood objective and proving the Fr\'echet differentiability of the soft Bellman operators. The effectiveness of the method is showcased through its accurate recovery of expert behavior in a mean-field traffic routing game.

Abstract: We consider the maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning problem for infinite-horizon stationary mean-field games, in which we model the unknown reward function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This allows the inference of rich and potentially nonlinear reward structures directly from expert demonstrations, in contrast to most existing inverse reinforcement learning approaches for mean-field games that typically restrict the reward function to a linear combination of a fixed finite set of basis functions. We also focus on the infinite-horizon cost structure, whereas prior studies primarily rely on finite-horizon formulations. We introduce a Lagrangian relaxation to this maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning problem that enables us to reformulate it as an unconstrained log-likelihood maximization problem, and obtain a solution \lk{via} a gradient ascent algorithm. To illustrate the theoretical consistency of the algorithm, we establish the smoothness of the log-likelihood objective by proving the Fr\'echet differentiability of the related soft Bellman operators with respect to the parameters in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a mean-field traffic routing game, where it accurately recovers expert behavior.

<div> affinity matrix, self-attention, deep learning architectures, pairwise relationships, feature relevance
<br />
Summary:
<br />
The paper discusses the concept of self-attention in deep learning models like Transformers and its connection to the broader principle of using pairwise affinity matrices to control information flow. It traces the origins of self-attention in various domains and highlights Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS) as a foundational approach that generalizes affinity-based weighting. Unlike Transformers' fixed dot-product structure, Inf-FS allows the affinity matrix to be defined through domain knowledge or learning and computes feature relevance using multi-hop propagation. Self-attention can be viewed as a special case of Inf-FS, with a dynamic single-hop affinity computation based on token similarities. The paper argues that both approaches share the same underlying structure of reasoning over pairwise relationships, with differences in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. It offers a unified perspective on affinity-based computation in machine learning models, showcasing a common mathematical foundation across diverse tasks and models.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS) as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for various graph mining tasks, yet existing scalable solutions often struggle to balance execution efficiency with prediction accuracy. These difficulties stem from iterative message-passing techniques, which place significant computational demands and require extensive GPU memory, particularly when dealing with the neighbor explosion issue inherent in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces a scalable, low-cost, flexible, and efficient GNN framework called LPS-GNN, which can perform representation learning on 100 billion graphs with a single GPU in 10 hours and shows a 13.8% improvement in User Acquisition scenarios. We examine existing graph partitioning methods and design a superior graph partition algorithm named LPMetis. In particular, LPMetis outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on various evaluation metrics. In addition, our paper proposes a subgraph augmentation strategy to enhance the model's predictive performance. It exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing the entire framework to accommodate various GNN algorithms. Successfully deployed on the Tencent platform, LPS-GNN has been tested on public and real-world datasets, achieving performance lifts of 8. 24% to 13. 89% over SOTA models in online applications.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in surveillance, logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. Accurate detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs, especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments, reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and 98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.

<div> algorithm, subspace, PCA, median, outliers

Summary:
The article introduces a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm for approximating the $k$-subspace median of a set of points in $\REAL^d$. The $k$-subspace median is a subspace that minimizes the sum of non-squared Euclidean distances over the points, providing a more robust estimate than the classic $k$-PCA mean. This algorithm offers a multiplicative approximation factor of $\sqrt{d}$ and a polynomial running time, making it efficient for practical use. The approach is expected to have applications in various related problems involving different norms of distances, handling outliers, and sparsity. Additionally, the article includes open-source code and presents experimental results on real-world datasets. <div>
arXiv:2507.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $k\geq1$ and a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\REAL^d$, the classic $k$-PCA (Principle Component Analysis) approximates the affine \emph{$k$-subspace mean} of $P$, which is the $k$-dimensional affine linear subspace that minimizes its sum of squared Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,2}$-norm) over the points of $P$, i.e., the mean of these distances. The \emph{$k$-subspace median} is the subspace that minimizes its sum of (non-squared) Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,1}$-mixed norm), i.e., their median. The median subspace is usually more sparse and robust to noise/outliers than the mean, but also much harder to approximate since, unlike the $\ell_{z,z}$ (non-mixed) norms, it is non-convex for $k<d-1$.
  We provide the first polynomial-time deterministic algorithm whose both running time and approximation factor are not exponential in $k$. More precisely, the multiplicative approximation factor is $\sqrt{d}$, and the running time is polynomial in the size of the input. We expect that our technique would be useful for many other related problems, such as $\ell_{2,z}$ norm of distances for $z\not \in \br{1,2}$, e.g., $z=\infty$, and handling outliers/sparsity.
  Open code and experimental results on real-world datasets are also provided.

Summary: 
The paper introduces AD-GCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework for improved anomaly detection in networks with power-law degree distributions. It addresses the issue of neglecting tail anomalies by utilizing a neighbor pruning strategy for noisy edges and anomaly-guided neighbor completion. AD-GCL enhances representation through intra- and inter-view consistency loss, improving the detection of both head and tail anomalies. The framework's performance evaluation on various datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting anomalies across different nodes. The proposed approach shows promise in enhancing anomaly detection algorithms for real-world networks with structural imbalance, providing more robust and secure risk warning systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its application to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems. Unfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall detection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance, which can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law degree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail anomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the security and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore hinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly detection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the above issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It devises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and facilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to forged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to enlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor completion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the original and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance evaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates the comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head anomalies and tail anomalies.

Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled examples.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a significant challenge, due to the extreme class imbalance in real-world data and the often subtle patterns that separate fraud from legitimate activity. Existing research commonly attempts to address this by generating synthetic samples for the minority class using approaches such as GANs, VAEs, or hybrid generative models. However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to minority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor latent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection performance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention Classifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware clustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based attention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN allowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample augmentation. We compared CPAC-augmented models to traditional oversamplers, such as SMOTE, as well as to state-of-the-art generative models, both with and without CPAC-based latent classifiers. Our results show that classifier-guided latent shaping with CPAC delivers superior performance, achieving an F1-score of 93.14\% percent and recall of 90.18\%, along with improved latent cluster separation. Further ablation studies and visualizations provide deeper insight into the benefits and limitations of classifier-driven representation learning for fraud detection. The codebase for this work will be available at final submission.

Summary:<br />
This research focuses on the integration of generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), into real-time multi-model AI applications on heterogeneous SoC architectures such as AMD's Ryzen AI. The study aims to explore the impact of scheduling policies on real-time generative AI workloads. By constructing realistic multi-model scenarios and profiling model performance across different backends, the researchers evaluate five scheduling policies. The results indicate that scheduling decisions have a significant effect on workload performance, with a 41.7% difference in deadline violation rates on average. This highlights the importance of workload-aware and dynamic heterogeneous scheduling strategies to optimize performance for real-time generative AI applications running on edge platforms. Workload dynamics and hardware heterogeneity should be taken into account when designing scheduling strategies for high-performance, on-device real-time generative AI applications. <div>

Abstract: The integration of generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), into real-time multi-model AI applications such as video conferencing and gaming is giving rise to a new class of workloads: real-time generative AI (RTGen). These workloads combine the compute intensity and dynamic execution patterns of generative models with the stringent latency and concurrency constraints of real-time inference. To meet the diverse demands of RTGen workloads, modern edge platforms increasingly adopt heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) architectures that integrate CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. Despite the potential of heterogeneous SoC, the scheduling space complexity and performance implications of RTGen workloads on such platforms remain underexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive characterization of RTGen workloads on AMD's latest heterogeneous SoC, Ryzen AI. We construct realistic multi-model scenarios inspired by industry use cases and profile model performance across all available backends. Using this data, we evaluate five scheduling policies and their impact on both real-time metrics (e.g., deadline violation rate) and LLM performance (e.g., time-to-first-token and tokens-per-second). Our results show that scheduling decisions significantly affect workload performance (e.g., leading to a 41.7% difference in deadline violation rates on average), and highlight the need for scheduling strategies that are aware of workload dynamics and hardware heterogeneity. Our findings underscore the importance of workload-aware, dynamic heterogeneous scheduling in enabling high-performance, on-device RTGen applications.

<br />Summary: 
Automated theorem proving (ATP) using large language models (LLMs) has long been a challenging task in artificial intelligence. While black-box approaches have benefited from LLM advancements, white-box methods have lagged. This paper introduces LeanTree, a white-box tool in Lean 4 that breaks down complex proof states into simpler branches and provides a dataset of these intermediate states. The white-box approach offers advantages such as simplified evaluation, reduced context, richer training data, parallel search across states, efficient state reuse, and error feedback. Preliminary results suggest that white-box methods may outperform black-box approaches in certain scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated theorem proving (ATP) has been a classical problem in artificial intelligence since its inception, yet it remains challenging due to its vast state and action space. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus require interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow one of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize intermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental proof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box approaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods have comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language that factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and (ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling offers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation, reduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel search across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides feedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box approaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.

Summary: GRID is a novel framework for prompt-based continual learning, addressing the challenges of latent forgetting and prompt memory explosion in adapting large language models across task sequences. The framework integrates a task-aware decoding mechanism that enhances backward transfer by using representative inputs and automatic task identification. It also introduces a gradient-based prompt selection strategy to compress less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Experimental results demonstrate that GRID significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80%.

arXiv:2507.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods assume task-aware inference and maintain a growing list of task-specific prompts, which limits scalability and hides latent forgetting. In this work, we introduce GRID, a unified framework that addresses two key limitations: (1) latent forgetting under task-agnostic inference, and (2) prompt memory explosion as task sequences grow. GRID integrates a task-aware decoding mechanism that improves backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Additionally, we propose a gradient-based prompt selection strategy that compresses less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Extensive experiments across short-sequence, long-sequence, and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on T5 and Flan-T5 backbones.

<div> Trainable activation functions, rational activations, reinforcement learning, continual learning, training stability<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Trainable activation functions, specifically rational activations defined as ratios of polynomials, offer increased expressivity in neural networks by optimizing parameters alongside network weights. However, their impact on training stability in reinforcement and continual learning settings poses challenges. While flexible rational activations enhance adaptability, they can introduce instability leading to overestimation in reinforcement learning and feature collapse in longer continual learning scenarios. A trade-off between expressivity and plasticity in rational activations is demonstrated in this work. To mitigate this, a constrained variant is proposed to limit excessive output scaling while preserving adaptability. Experiments across various environments show improved training stability and performance using the constrained approach. The study also reveals how different constraints affect the balance between expressivity and long-term retention in continual learning benchmarks. These findings provide valuable design principles for robust and adaptable trainable activations in dynamic, non-stationary environments. <div>

Specifically, trainable activation functions defined as ratios of polynomials (rational functions) have been proposed to enhance plasticity in reinforcement learning. However, their impact on training stability remains unclear. In this work, we study trainable rational activations in both reinforcement and continual learning settings. We find that while their flexibility enhances adaptability, it can also introduce instability, leading to overestimation in RL and feature collapse in longer continual learning scenarios. Our main result is demonstrating a trade-off between expressivity and plasticity in rational activations. To address this, we propose a constrained variant that structurally limits excessive output scaling while preserving adaptability. Experiments across MetaWorld and DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) environments show that our approach improves training stability and performance. In continual learning benchmarks, including MNIST with reshuffled labels and Split CIFAR-100, we reveal how different constraints affect the balance between expressivity and long-term retention. While preliminary experiments in discrete action domains (e.g., Atari) did not show similar instability, this suggests that the trade-off is particularly relevant for continuous control. Together, our findings provide actionable design principles for robust and adaptable trainable activations in dynamic, non-stationary environments.

<div> inverse Hessian-vector product, Training data attribution, influence functions, EKFAC-preconditioner, Neumann series

Summary:
The article introduces a new algorithm, ASTRA, for Training Data Attribution (TDA) that improves the accuracy of computing inverse Hessian-vector products (iHVP) crucial for understanding model behavior. ASTRA leverages the EKFAC-preconditioner in Neumann series iterations to efficiently approximate iHVPs. Compared to existing methods like influence functions and unrolled differentiation, ASTRA requires fewer iterations and provides more accurate iHVP approximations. By enhancing the precision of iHVP computations, ASTRA enhances TDA performance, shedding light on the crucial training data that shapes a model's learned behavior. The algorithm's effectiveness lies in its ease of tuning, efficiency in computation, and ability to significantly improve TDA insights through better iHVP approximations. Overall, ASTRA presents a promising approach for enhancing TDA methodologies and gaining deeper insights into model behavior. <div>

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) provides insights into which training data is responsible for a learned model behavior. Gradient-based TDA methods such as influence functions and unrolled differentiation both involve a computation that resembles an inverse Hessian-vector product (iHVP), which is difficult to approximate efficiently. We introduce an algorithm (ASTRA) which uses the EKFAC-preconditioner on Neumann series iterations to arrive at an accurate iHVP approximation for TDA. ASTRA is easy to tune, requires fewer iterations than Neumann series iterations, and is more accurate than EKFAC-based approximations. Using ASTRA, we show that improving the accuracy of the iHVP approximation can significantly improve TDA performance.

<title>Beyond the Single-Best Model: Rashomon Partial Dependence Profile for Trustworthy Explanations in AutoML</title>

<div> Keywords: Automated machine learning, Rashomon set, explanation uncertainty, interpretive variability, model interpretations

Summary:
Automated machine learning systems often overlook explanation uncertainty, which is crucial for human-centered explainable AI. A novel framework is proposed that incorporates model multiplicity by aggregating partial dependence profiles (PDP) from a set of near-optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. The Rashomon PDP captures interpretive variability and disagreement among models, providing users with a richer, uncertainty-aware view of feature effects. Quantitative metrics, such as the coverage rate and the mean width of confidence intervals, are introduced to evaluate the consistency between standard PDP and the Rashomon PDP. Experiments on 35 regression datasets show that the Rashomon PDP improves the reliability and trustworthiness of model interpretations by incorporating additional information that single model explanations overlook. This approach is particularly beneficial in high-stakes domains where transparency and confidence are essential.

Abstract: Automated machine learning systems efficiently streamline model selection but often focus on a single best-performing model, overlooking explanation uncertainty, an essential concern in human centered explainable AI. To address this, we propose a novel framework that incorporates model multiplicity into explanation generation by aggregating partial dependence profiles (PDP) from a set of near optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. The resulting Rashomon PDP captures interpretive variability and highlights areas of disagreement, providing users with a richer, uncertainty aware view of feature effects. To evaluate its usefulness, we introduce two quantitative metrics, the coverage rate and the mean width of confidence intervals, to evaluate the consistency between the standard PDP and the proposed Rashomon PDP. Experiments on 35 regression datasets from the OpenML CTR23 benchmark suite show that in most cases, the Rashomon PDP covers less than 70% of the best model's PDP, underscoring the limitations of single model explanations. Our findings suggest that Rashomon PDP improves the reliability and trustworthiness of model interpretations by adding additional information that would otherwise be neglected. This is particularly useful in high stakes domains where transparency and confidence are critical.

<div> Keywords: high-fidelity simulations, Gaussian processes, global sensitivity analysis, optimization, sampling methods <br />
Summary:<br />
High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are costly, limiting their use in engineering analysis. To address this issue, Gaussian processes (GPs) are employed as proxy regression models for uncertainty-aware predictions based on limited observations. This paper introduces two sampling methods for generating posterior samples from GPs: random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning. These samples can be utilized in global sensitivity analysis, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. By applying these sampling methods in various numerical examples, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated. <div>

Abstract: High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are essential for engineering analysis and design. However, their high cost often limits their applications in two critical tasks: global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and optimization. This limitation motivates the common use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as proxy regression models to provide uncertainty-aware predictions based on a limited number of high-quality observations. GPs naturally enable efficient sampling strategies that support informed decision-making under uncertainty by extracting information from a subset of possible functions for the model of interest. Despite their popularity in machine learning and statistics communities, sampling from GPs has received little attention in the community of engineering optimization. In this paper, we present the formulation and detailed implementation of two notable sampling methods -- random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning -- for generating posterior samples from GPs. Alternative approaches are briefly described. Importantly, we detail how the generated samples can be applied in GSA, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. We show successful applications of these sampling methods through a series of numerical examples.

arXiv:2507.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the prevalence of recurrent circuits in biological brains, we investigate the degree to which directionality is a helpful inductive bias for artificial neural networks. Taking directionality as topologically-ordered information flow between neurons, we formalise a perceptron layer with all-to-all connections (mathematically equivalent to a weight-tied recurrent neural network) and demonstrate that directionality, a hallmark of modern feed-forward networks, can be induced rather than hard-wired by applying appropriate pruning techniques. Across different random seeds our pruning schemes successfully induce greater topological ordering in information flow between neurons without compromising performance, suggesting that directionality is not a prerequisite for learning, but may be an advantageous inductive bias discoverable by gradient descent and sparsification.

<title>Skill Learning via Policy Diversity Yields Identifiable Representations for Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised feature learning and pretraining methods in reinforcement learning (RL) often rely on information-theoretic principles, termed mutual information skill learning (MISL). These methods aim to learn a representation of the environment while also incentivizing exploration thereof. However, the role of the representation and mutual information parametrization in MISL is not yet well understood theoretically. Our work investigates MISL through the lens of identifiable representation learning by focusing on the Contrastive Successor Features (CSF) method. We prove that CSF can provably recover the environment's ground-truth features up to a linear transformation due to the inner product parametrization of the features and skill diversity in a discriminative sense. This first identifiability guarantee for representation learning in RL also helps explain the implications of different mutual information objectives and the downsides of entropy regularizers. We empirically validate our claims in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control and show how CSF provably recovers the ground-truth features both from states and pixels.

<title>CXR-TFT: Multi-Modal Temporal Fusion Transformer for Predicting Chest X-ray Trajectories</title>

Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.

<title>Rethinking Memorization Measures and their Implications in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Concerned with privacy threats, memorization in LLMs is often seen as undesirable, specifically for learning. In this paper, we study whether memorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the privacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we re-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely recollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed contextual memorization.
  Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual memorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning ability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its recollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a learned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training. Conceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based memorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization. Theoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization, but imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and information requirements.
  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of different entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on memorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a language cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c) improved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but increases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing reports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat nor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Think, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by 5.2\% over joint training and 9.1\% over model merging. These results highlight the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: The complexity and interconnectivity of entities involved in money laundering demand investigative reasoning over graph-structured data. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines over localized subgraphs extracted from a financial knowledge graph. We propose a lightweight pipeline that retrieves k-hop neighborhoods around entities of interest, serializes them into structured text, and prompts an LLM via few-shot in-context learning to assess suspiciousness and generate justifications. Using synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.

Abstract: Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion. We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant: their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.

<title>Subliminal Learning: Language models transmit behavioral traits via hidden signals in data</title>

Abstract: We study subliminal learning, a surprising phenomenon where language models transmit behavioral traits via semantically unrelated data. In our main experiments, a "teacher" model with some trait T (such as liking owls or being misaligned) generates a dataset consisting solely of number sequences. Remarkably, a "student" model trained on this dataset learns T. This occurs even when the data is filtered to remove references to T. We observe the same effect when training on code or reasoning traces generated by the same teacher model. However, we do not observe the effect when the teacher and student have different base models. To help explain our findings, we prove a theoretical result showing that subliminal learning occurs in all neural networks under certain conditions, and demonstrate subliminal learning in a simple MLP classifier. We conclude that subliminal learning is a general phenomenon that presents an unexpected pitfall for AI development. Distillation could propagate unintended traits, even when developers try to prevent this via data filtering.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful approach for processing electronic health records (EHRs), offering flexibility to handle diverse medical data modalities. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing additional bias. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of effective and trustworthy multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems for real-world clinical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/nliulab/MIMIC-Multimodal.

Abstract: We revisit previous contrastive learning frameworks to investigate the effect of introducing an adaptive margin into the contrastive loss function for time series representation learning. Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with linear probing. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/sfi-norwai/eMargin.

<title>The Invisible Leash: Why RLVR May Not Escape Its Origin</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR. First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step, answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain valuable clinical information for predicting patient outcomes and guiding healthcare decisions. However, effectively modeling Electronic Health Records (EHRs) requires addressing data heterogeneity and complex temporal patterns. Standard approaches often struggle with irregular time intervals between clinical events. We propose TALE-EHR, a Transformer-based framework featuring a novel time-aware attention mechanism that explicitly models continuous temporal gaps to capture fine-grained sequence dynamics. To complement this temporal modeling with robust semantics, TALE-EHR leverages embeddings derived from standardized code descriptions using a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), providing a strong foundation for understanding clinical concepts. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV and PIC dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tasks such as disease progression forecasting. TALE-EHR underscores the benefit of integrating explicit, continuous temporal modeling with strong semantic representations provides a powerful solution for advancing EHR analysis.

Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks. Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate while also improving performance across all the environments.

Abstract: Pattern recognition with concise and flat AND-rules makes the Tsetlin Machine (TM) both interpretable and efficient, while the power of Tsetlin automata enables accuracy comparable to deep learning on an increasing number of datasets. We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat, fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences, grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training 2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new possibilities for TM learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant versatility and performance benefits, but their widespread adoption is often hindered by high model complexity and computational demands. Model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges. However, it remains critical to ensure that application-specific performance characteristics are preserved during compression. In structured pruning, where groups of structurally coherent elements are removed, conventional importance metrics frequently fail to maintain these essential performance attributes. In this work, we propose an enhanced importance metric framework that not only reduces model size but also explicitly accounts for application-specific performance constraints. We employ multiple strategies to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each group, ensuring a balance between compression and task performance. Our approach is evaluated on an autoencoder tasked with reconstructing MNIST images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively preserves task-relevant performance, maintaining the model's usability even after substantial pruning, by satisfying the required application-specific criteria.

Abstract: One of the key obstacles in traditional deep learning is the reduction in model transparency caused by increasingly intricate model functions, which can lead to problems such as overfitting and excessive confidence in predictions. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering possible advances in computational power and latent space complexity, we notice the same opaque behavior. Despite significant research in classical contexts, there has been little advancement in addressing the black-box nature of quantum machine learning. Consequently, we approach this gap by building upon existing work in classical uncertainty quantification and initial explorations in quantum Bayesian modeling to theoretically develop and empirically evaluate techniques to map classical uncertainty quantification methods to the quantum machine learning domain. Our findings emphasize the necessity of leveraging classical insights into uncertainty quantification to include uncertainty awareness in the process of designing new quantum machine learning models.

<title>FedWCM: Unleashing the Potential of Momentum-based Federated Learning in Long-Tailed Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FL faces challenges with non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, especially in long-tailed scenarios with imbalanced class samples. Momentum-based FL methods, often used to accelerate FL convergence, struggle with these distributions, resulting in biased models and making FL hard to converge. To understand this challenge, we conduct extensive investigations into this phenomenon, accompanied by a layer-wise analysis of neural network behavior. Based on these insights, we propose FedWCM, a method that dynamically adjusts momentum using global and per-round data to correct directional biases introduced by long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments show that FedWCM resolves non-convergence issues and outperforms existing methods, enhancing FL's efficiency and effectiveness in handling client heterogeneity and data imbalance.

<title>Clustered Federated Learning for Generalizable FDIA Detection in Smart Grids with Heterogeneous Data</title>

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication (client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

<title>ROBAD: Robust Adversary-aware Local-Global Attended Bad Actor Detection Sequential Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15067</link>

arXiv:2507.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting bad actors is critical to ensure the safety and integrity of internet platforms. Several deep learning-based models have been developed to identify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors, but also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection. However, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness requirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input sequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model understanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the model can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To achieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model, called ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection model), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to detect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder block to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to capture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the transformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post embeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence embedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to enrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked attackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for sequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information (i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors of bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can effectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Flow-matching policies have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generalist robotics. These models are trained to imitate an action chunk, conditioned on sensor observations and textual instructions. Often, training demonstrations are generated by a suboptimal policy, such as a human operator. This work explores training flow-matching policies via reinforcement learning to surpass the original demonstration policy performance. We particularly note minimum-time control as a key application and present a simple scheme for variable-horizon flow-matching planning. We then introduce two families of approaches: a simple Reward-Weighted Flow Matching (RWFM) scheme and a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) approach with a learned reward surrogate. Our policies are trained on an illustrative suite of simulated unicycle dynamics tasks, and we show that both approaches dramatically improve upon the suboptimal demonstrator performance, with the GRPO approach in particular generally incurring between $50\%$ and $85\%$ less cost than a naive Imitation Learning Flow Matching (ILFM) approach.

<title>Isotonic Quantile Regression Averaging for uncertainty quantification of electricity price forecasts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of forecasting models is essential to assess and mitigate the risks associated with data-driven decisions, especially in volatile domains such as electricity markets. Machine learning methods can provide highly accurate electricity price forecasts, critical for informing the decisions of market participants. However, these models often lack uncertainty estimates, which limits the ability of decision makers to avoid unnecessary risks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating probabilistic forecasts from ensembles of point forecasts, called Isotonic Quantile Regression Averaging (iQRA). Building on the established framework of Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA), we introduce stochastic order constraints to improve forecast accuracy, reliability, and computational costs. In an extensive forecasting study of the German day-ahead electricity market, we show that iQRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art postprocessing methods in terms of both reliability and sharpness. It produces well-calibrated prediction intervals across multiple confidence levels, providing superior reliability to all benchmark methods, particularly coverage-based conformal prediction. In addition, isotonic regularization decreases the complexity of the quantile regression problem and offers a hyperparameter-free approach to variable selection.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel extension to robust control theory that explicitly addresses uncertainty in the value function's gradient, a form of uncertainty endemic to applications like reinforcement learning where value functions are approximated. We formulate a zero-sum dynamic game where an adversary perturbs both system dynamics and the value function gradient, leading to a new, highly nonlinear partial differential equation: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs Equation with Gradient Uncertainty (GU-HJBI). We establish its well-posedness by proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform ellipticity condition. Our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) case yields a key insight: we prove that the classical quadratic value function assumption fails for any non-zero gradient uncertainty, fundamentally altering the problem structure. A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial correction to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal control law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge theory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust Actor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing training. This work provides a new direction for robust control, holding significant implications for fields where function approximation is common, including reinforcement learning and computational finance.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in AI/ML offer exciting opportunities to revolutionize analog design automation through data-driven approaches. In particular, researchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative AI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the full potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires access to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the analog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not only confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial semiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely confined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused private datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation and impedes progress across the research community. To address these challenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology discovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or institutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this vision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique challenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development and data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure both flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor manufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset sizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines--while maintaining strict data privacy. Specifically, the generative AI model within AnalogFed achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability in the design of analog circuit topologies.

<title>Distributional Unlearning: Forgetting Distributions, Not Just Samples</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove unwanted information from trained models, initially at the individual-sample level, but increasingly at the level of entire sub-populations. In many deployments, models must delete whole topical domains to satisfy privacy, legal, or quality requirements, e.g., removing several users' posts under GDPR or copyrighted web content. Existing unlearning tools remain largely sample-oriented, and straightforward point deletion often leaves enough residual signal for downstream learners to recover the unwanted domain. We introduce distributional unlearning, a data-centric, model-agnostic framework that asks: Given examples from an unwanted distribution and a retained distribution, what is the smallest set of points whose removal makes the edited dataset far from the unwanted domain yet close to the retained one? Using Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify removal and preservation, we derive the exact Pareto frontier in the Gaussian case and prove that any model retrained on the edited data incurs log-loss shifts bounded by the divergence thresholds. We propose a simple distance-based selection rule satisfying these constraints with a quadratic reduction in deletion budget compared to random removal. Experiments on synthetic Gaussians, Jigsaw Toxic Comments, SMS spam, and CIFAR-10 show 15-72% fewer deletions than random, with negligible impact on retained performance.

<title>Are We Overlooking the Dimensions? Learning Latent Hierarchical Channel Structure for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis. However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, a benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.

Abstract: The research community continues to seek increasingly more advanced synthetic data generators to reliably evaluate the strengths and limitations of machine learning methods. This work aims to increase the availability of datasets encompassing a diverse range of problem complexities by proposing a genetic algorithm that optimizes a set of problem complexity measures for classification and regression tasks towards specific targets. For classification, a set of 10 complexity measures was used, while for regression tasks, 4 measures demonstrating promising optimization capabilities were selected. Experiments confirmed that the proposed genetic algorithm can generate datasets with varying levels of difficulty by transforming synthetically created datasets to achieve target complexity values through linear feature projections. Evaluations involving state-of-the-art classifiers and regressors revealed a correlation between the complexity of the generated data and the recognition quality.

Abstract: We investigate multi-label classification involving large sets of labels, where the output labels may be known to satisfy some logical constraints. We look at an architecture in which classifiers for individual labels are fed into an expressive sequential model, which produces a joint distribution. One of the potential advantages for such an expressive model is its ability to modelling correlations, as can arise from constraints. We empirically demonstrate the ability of the architecture both to exploit constraints in training and to enforce constraints at inference time.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to push into real-time, edge-based and resource-constrained environments, there is an urgent need for novel, hardware-efficient computational models. In this study, we present and validate a neuromorphic computing architecture based on resonant-tunnelling diodes (RTDs), which exhibit the nonlinear characteristics ideal for physical reservoir computing (RC). We theoretically formulate and numerically implement an RTD-based RC system and demonstrate its effectiveness on two image recognition benchmarks: handwritten digit classification and object recognition using the Fruit~360 dataset. Our results show that this circuit-level architecture delivers promising performance while adhering to the principles of next-generation RC -- eliminating random connectivity in favour of a deterministic nonlinear transformation of input signals.

<title>Designing User-Centric Metrics for Evaluation of Counterfactual Explanations</title>

arXiv:2507.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based decision models are increasingly being used to make decisions that significantly impact people's lives, but their opaque nature leaves end users without a clear understanding of why a decision was made. Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) have grown in popularity as a means of offering actionable guidance by identifying the minimum changes in feature values required to flip a model's prediction to something more desirable. Unfortunately, most prior research in CFEs relies on artificial evaluation metrics, such as proximity, which may overlook end-user preferences and constraints, e.g., the user's perception of effort needed to make certain feature changes may differ from that of the model designer. To address this research gap, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, we conduct a pilot study with 20 crowd-workers on Amazon MTurk to experimentally validate the alignment of existing CF evaluation metrics with real-world user preferences. Results show that user-preferred CFEs matched those based on proximity in only 63.81% of cases, highlighting the limited applicability of these metrics in real-world settings. Second, inspired by the need to design a user-informed evaluation metric for CFEs, we conduct a more detailed two-day user study with 41 participants facing realistic credit application scenarios to find experimental support for or against three intuitive hypotheses that may explain how end users evaluate CFEs. Third, based on the findings of this second study, we propose the AWP model, a novel user-centric, two-stage model that describes one possible mechanism by which users evaluate and select CFEs. Our results show that AWP predicts user-preferred CFEs with 84.37% accuracy. Our study provides the first human-centered validation for personalized cost models in CFE generation and highlights the need for adaptive, user-centered evaluation metrics.

<title>Better Models and Algorithms for Learning Ising Models from Dynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning the structure and parameters of the Ising model, a fundamental model of high-dimensional data, when observing the evolution of an associated Markov chain. A recent line of work has studied the natural problem of learning when observing an evolution of the well-known Glauber dynamics [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018, Gaitonde, Mossel STOC 2024], which provides an arguably more realistic generative model than the classical i.i.d. setting. However, this prior work crucially assumes that all site update attempts are observed, \emph{even when this attempt does not change the configuration}: this strong observation model is seemingly essential for these approaches. While perhaps possible in restrictive contexts, this precludes applicability to most realistic settings where we can observe \emph{only} the stochastic evolution itself, a minimal and natural assumption for any process we might hope to learn from. However, designing algorithms that succeed in this more realistic setting has remained an open problem [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018, Gaitonde, Moitra, Mossel, STOC 2025].
  In this work, we give the first algorithms that efficiently learn the Ising model in this much more natural observation model that only observes when the configuration changes. For Ising models with maximum degree $d$, our algorithm recovers the underlying dependency graph in time $\mathsf{poly}(d)\cdot n^2\log n$ and then the actual parameters in additional $\widetilde{O}(2^d n)$ time, which qualitatively matches the state-of-the-art even in the i.i.d. setting in a much weaker observation model. Our analysis holds more generally for a broader class of reversible, single-site Markov chains that also includes the popular Metropolis chain by leveraging more robust properties of reversible Markov chains.

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for managing urban traffic flow and reducing congestion. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/JL-GAT/.

arXiv:2507.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs, along with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset, underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node representations.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a practical and challenging task. This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances, respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.

<title>Exact Reformulation and Optimization for Direct Metric Optimization in Binary Imbalanced Classification</title>

Abstract: For classification with imbalanced class frequencies, i.e., imbalanced classification (IC), standard accuracy is known to be misleading as a performance measure. While most existing methods for IC resort to optimizing balanced accuracy (i.e., the average of class-wise recalls), they fall short in scenarios where the significance of classes varies or certain metrics should reach prescribed levels. In this paper, we study two key classification metrics, precision and recall, under three practical binary IC settings: fix precision optimize recall (FPOR), fix recall optimize precision (FROP), and optimize $F_\beta$-score (OFBS). Unlike existing methods that rely on smooth approximations to deal with the indicator function involved, \textit{we introduce, for the first time, exact constrained reformulations for these direct metric optimization (DMO) problems}, which can be effectively solved by exact penalty methods. Experiment results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the practical superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods for the three DMO problems. We also expect our exact reformulation and optimization (ERO) framework to be applicable to a wide range of DMO problems for binary IC and beyond. Our code is available at https://github.com/sun-umn/DMO.

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.

<title>CHORDS: Diffusion Sampling Accelerator with Multi-core Hierarchical ODE Solvers</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have become dominant generators of high-fidelity images and videos but remain limited by their computationally expensive inference procedures. Existing acceleration techniques either require extensive model retraining or compromise significantly on sample quality. This paper explores a general, training-free, and model-agnostic acceleration strategy via multi-core parallelism. Our framework views multi-core diffusion sampling as an ODE solver pipeline, where slower yet accurate solvers progressively rectify faster solvers through a theoretically justified inter-core communication mechanism. This motivates our multi-core training-free diffusion sampling accelerator, CHORDS, which is compatible with various diffusion samplers, model architectures, and modalities. Through extensive experiments, CHORDS significantly accelerates sampling across diverse large-scale image and video diffusion models, yielding up to 2.1x speedup with four cores, improving by 50% over baselines, and 2.9x speedup with eight cores, all without quality degradation. This advancement enables CHORDS to establish a solid foundation for real-time, high-fidelity diffusion generation.

<title>Temporal Basis Function Models for Closed-Loop Neural Stimulation</title>

Abstract: Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Progress requires us to address a number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two non-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF models for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target patterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid to train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to successfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction accuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model. In our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to control a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.

<title>Machine Unlearning for Streaming Forgetting</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove knowledge of the specific training data in a well-trained model. Currently, machine unlearning methods typically handle all forgetting data in a single batch, removing the corresponding knowledge all at once upon request. However, in practical scenarios, requests for data removal often arise in a streaming manner rather than in a single batch, leading to reduced efficiency and effectiveness in existing methods. Such challenges of streaming forgetting have not been the focus of much research. In this paper, to address the challenges of performance maintenance, efficiency, and data access brought about by streaming unlearning requests, we introduce a streaming unlearning paradigm, formalizing the unlearning as a distribution shift problem. We then estimate the altered distribution and propose a novel streaming unlearning algorithm to achieve efficient streaming forgetting without requiring access to the original training data. Theoretical analyses confirm an $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$ error bound on the streaming unlearning regret, where $V_T$ represents the cumulative total variation in the optimal solution over $T$ learning rounds. This theoretical guarantee is achieved under mild conditions without the strong restriction of convex loss function. Experiments across various models and datasets validate the performance of our proposed method.

<title>Mixture of Autoencoder Experts Guidance using Unlabeled and Incomplete Data for Exploration in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent trends in Reinforcement Learning (RL) highlight the need for agents to learn from reward-free interactions and alternative supervision signals, such as unlabeled or incomplete demonstrations, rather than relying solely on explicit reward maximization. Additionally, developing generalist agents that can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors and accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our approach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and dense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete. This provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal data is unavailable and precise reward control is needed.

<title>Preferential subspace identification (PSID) with forward-backward smoothing</title>

Abstract: System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural and behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one from the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering. Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate time-series.

<title>Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Showdown</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15290</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with \emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems -- has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off: larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source code for all our experiments in https://github.com/SarahLiaw/ctx-bandits-mcmc-showdown.

Abstract: Accurately and comprehensively representing crystal structures is critical for advancing machine learning in large-scale crystal materials simulations, however, effectively capturing and leveraging the intricate geometric and topological characteristics of crystal structures remains a core, long-standing challenge for most existing methods in crystal property prediction. Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.

<title>Beyond Model Base Selection: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design</title>

Abstract: Database systems have recently advocated for embedding machine learning (ML) capabilities, offering declarative model queries over large, managed model repositories, thereby circumventing the huge computational overhead of traditional ML-based algorithms in automated neural network model selection. Pioneering database studies aim to organize existing benchmark repositories as model bases (MB), querying them for the model records with the highest performance estimation metrics for given tasks. However, this static model selection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies between diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in suboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill the model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated model knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by adaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First, we propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an adaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN quickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a graph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties, architecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations. This schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks and drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics tasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with structured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing data records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that M-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited budgets.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL) supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain, decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their own specialized data.

<title>To Label or Not to Label: PALM -- A Predictive Model for Evaluating Sample Efficiency in Active Learning Models</title>

arXiv:2507.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy, coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at: https://github.com/juliamachnio/PALM.

<title>Learning to Gridize: Segment Physical World by Wireless Communication Channel</title>

arXiv:2507.15386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gridization, the process of partitioning space into grids where users share similar channel characteristics, serves as a fundamental prerequisite for efficient large-scale network optimization. However, existing methods like Geographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on unavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal strengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space Gridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and gridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG uses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel Angle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous channel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder (CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse codebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized Statistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training scheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous (PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by systematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm. Evaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and clustering quality on synthetic data. On real-world datasets, it reduces Active Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 30\% and Overall MAE by 65\% on RSRP prediction accuracy compared to salient baselines using the same data, while improving channel consistency, cluster sizes balance, and active ratio, advancing the development of gridization for large-scale network optimization.

arXiv:2507.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful but previously heuristic methods.

<title>The calculus of variations of the Transformer on the hyperspherical tangent bundle</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a theoretical mathematical background to Transformers through Lagrangian optimization across the token space. The Transformer, as a flow map, exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts, we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding, oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the Transformer.

Abstract: This work proposes a training algorithm based on adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) with Metropolis sampling and resampling \cite{kammonen2024adaptiverandomfourierfeatures} for learning drift and diffusion components of stochastic differential equations from snapshot data. Specifically, this study considers It\^{o} diffusion processes and a likelihood-based loss function derived from the Euler-Maruyama integration introduced in \cite{Dietrich2023} and \cite{dridi2021learningstochasticdynamicalsystems}.
  This work evaluates the proposed method against benchmark problems presented in \cite{Dietrich2023}, including polynomial examples, underdamped Langevin dynamics, a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model, and a stochastic wave equation. Across all cases, the ARFF-based approach matches or surpasses the performance of conventional Adam-based optimization in both loss minimization and convergence speed. These results highlight the potential of ARFF as a compelling alternative for data-driven modeling of stochastic dynamics.

Abstract: In-vehicle emotion recognition underpins adaptive driver-assistance systems and, ultimately, occupant safety. However, practical deployment is hindered by (i) modality fragility - poor lighting and occlusions degrade vision-based methods; (ii) physiological variability - heart-rate and skin-conductance patterns differ across individuals; and (iii) privacy risk - centralized training requires transmission of sensitive data. To address these challenges, we present FedMultiEmo, a privacy-preserving framework that fuses two complementary modalities at the decision level: visual features extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network from facial images, and physiological cues (heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) classified by a Random Forest. FedMultiEmo builds on three key elements: (1) a multimodal federated learning pipeline with majority-vote fusion, (2) an end-to-end edge-to-cloud prototype on Raspberry Pi clients and a Flower server, and (3) a personalized Federated Averaging scheme that weights client updates by local data volume. Evaluated on FER2013 and a custom physiological dataset, the federated Convolutional Neural Network attains 77% accuracy, the Random Forest 74%, and their fusion 87%, matching a centralized baseline while keeping all raw data local. The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time of 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB. These results indicate that FedMultiEmo offers a practical approach to real-time, privacy-aware emotion recognition in automotive settings.

<title>Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models, such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/JohannesAck/OffPolicyCorrectedRewardModeling

Abstract: Domain shift is a prominent problem in Deep Learning, causing a model pre-trained on a source dataset to suffer significant performance degradation on test datasets. This research aims to address the issue of audio classification under domain shift caused by background noise using Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), a technique that adapts a pre-trained model during testing using only unlabelled test data before making predictions. We adopt two common TTA methods, TTT and TENT, and a state-of-the-art method CoNMix, and investigate their respective performance on two popular audio classification datasets, AudioMNIST (AM) and SpeechCommands V1 (SC), against different types of background noise and noise severity levels. The experimental results reveal that our proposed modified version of CoNMix produced the highest classification accuracy under domain shift (5.31% error rate under 10 dB exercise bike background noise and 12.75% error rate under 3 dB running tap background noise for AM) compared to TTT and TENT. The literature search provided no evidence of similar works, thereby motivating the work reported here as the first study to leverage TTA techniques for audio classification under domain shift.

Abstract: The success of Machine Learning is increasingly tempered by its significant resource footprint, driving interest in efficient paradigms like TinyML. However, the inherent complexity of designing TinyML systems hampers their broad adoption. To reduce this complexity, we introduce "Data Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search". Unlike conventional Differentiable Neural Architecture Search, our approach expands the search space to include data configuration parameters alongside architectural choices. This enables Data Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search to co-optimize model architecture and input data characteristics, effectively balancing resource usage and system performance for TinyML applications. Initial results on keyword spotting demonstrate that this novel approach to TinyML system design can generate lean but highly accurate systems.

<title>The added value for MRI radiomics and deep-learning for glioblastoma prognostication compared to clinical and molecular information</title>

Abstract: Background: Radiomics shows promise in characterizing glioblastoma, but its added value over clinical and molecular predictors has yet to be proven. This study assessed the added value of conventional radiomics (CR) and deep learning (DL) MRI radiomics for glioblastoma prognosis (<= 6 vs > 6 months survival) on a large multi-center dataset.
  Methods: After patient selection, our curated dataset gathers 1152 glioblastoma (WHO 2016) patients from five Swiss centers and one public source. It included clinical (age, gender), molecular (MGMT, IDH), and baseline MRI data (T1, T1 contrast, FLAIR, T2) with tumor regions. CR and DL models were developed using standard methods and evaluated on internal and external cohorts. Sub-analyses assessed models with different feature sets (imaging-only, clinical/molecular-only, combined-features) and patient subsets (S-1: all patients, S-2: with molecular data, S-3: IDH wildtype).
  Results: The best performance was observed in the full cohort (S-1). In external validation, the combined-feature CR model achieved an AUC of 0.75, slightly, but significantly outperforming clinical-only (0.74) and imaging-only (0.68) models. DL models showed similar trends, though without statistical significance. In S-2 and S-3, combined models did not outperform clinical-only models. Exploratory analysis of CR models for overall survival prediction suggested greater relevance of imaging data: across all subsets, combined-feature models significantly outperformed clinical-only models, though with a modest advantage of 2-4 C-index points.
  Conclusions: While confirming the predictive value of anatomical MRI sequences for glioblastoma prognosis, this multi-center study found standard CR and DL radiomics approaches offer minimal added value over demographic predictors such as age and gender.

Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce PhysGym, a novel benchmark suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific reasoning in interactive physics environments. PhysGym's primary contribution lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. PhysGym provides standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.

<title>Trade-offs between elective surgery rescheduling and length-of-stay prediction accuracy</title>

Abstract: The availability of downstream resources plays a critical role in planning the admission of patients undergoing elective surgery, with inpatient beds being one of the most crucial resources. When planning patient admissions, predictions on their length-of-stay (LOS) made by machine learning (ML) models are used to ensure bed availability. However, the actual LOS for each patient may differ considerably from the predicted value, potentially making the schedule infeasible. To address such infeasibilities, rescheduling strategies that take advantage of operational flexibility can be implemented. For example, adjustments may include postponing admission dates, relocating patients to different wards, or even transferring patients who are already admitted. The common assumption is that more accurate LOS predictions reduce the impact of rescheduling. However, training ML models that can make such accurate predictions can be costly. Building on previous work that proposed simulated \ac{ml} for evaluating data-driven approaches, this paper explores the relationship between LOS prediction accuracy and rescheduling flexibility across various corrective policies. Specifically, we examine the most effective patient rescheduling strategies under LOS prediction errors to prevent bed overflows while optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of satellite constellations in near-Earth orbits presents significant challenges in satellite network management, requiring innovative approaches for efficient, scalable, and resilient operations. This paper explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation of satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland University, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for two crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In the routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the end-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming classical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the scheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using limited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for multiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios, resembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth observation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes with classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the autonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets. The findings of this activity suggest that AI can fundamentally alter the landscape of satellite constellation management by providing more adaptive, robust, and cost-effective solutions.

Abstract: Despite the continuous proposal of new anomaly detection algorithms and extensive benchmarking efforts, progress seems to stagnate, with only minor performance differences between established baselines and new algorithms. In this position paper, we argue that this stagnation is due to limitations in how we evaluate anomaly detection algorithms. Current benchmarking does not, for example, sufficiently reflect the diversity of anomalies in applications ranging from predictive maintenance to scientific discovery. Consequently, we need to rethink benchmarking in anomaly detection. In our opinion, anomaly detection should be studied using scenarios that capture the relevant characteristics of different applications. We identify three key areas for improvement: First, we need to identify anomaly detection scenarios based on a common taxonomy. Second, anomaly detection pipelines should be analyzed end-to-end and by component. Third, evaluating anomaly detection algorithms should be meaningful regarding the scenario's objectives.

Abstract: Current research on decision-making in safety-critical scenarios often relies on inefficient data-driven scenario generation or specific modeling approaches, which fail to capture corner cases in real-world contexts. To address this issue, we propose a Red-Team Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework, where background vehicles with interference capabilities are treated as red-team agents. Through active interference and exploration, red-team vehicles can uncover corner cases outside the data distribution. The framework uses a Constraint Graph Representation Markov Decision Process, ensuring that red-team vehicles comply with safety rules while continuously disrupting the autonomous vehicles (AVs). A policy threat zone model is constructed to quantify the threat posed by red-team vehicles to AVs, inducing more extreme actions to increase the danger level of the scenario. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly impacts AVs decision-making safety and generates various corner cases. This method also offers a novel direction for research in safety-critical scenarios.

<title>Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15601</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.

<title>Accelerating HEC-RAS: A Recurrent Neural Operator for Rapid River Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15614</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based solvers like HEC-RAS provide high-fidelity river forecasts but are too computationally intensive for on-the-fly decision-making during flood events. The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without sacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that treats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a hybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural Operator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river reach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal eight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and boundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67 reaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a year-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong predictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet. Critically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the required wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly 3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach demonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed replacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational feasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting.

<title>Data Mixing Agent: Learning to Re-weight Domains for Continual Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment. Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining. Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior model performance with less source-field data.

Abstract: Shared mobility systems, such as bike-sharing networks, play a crucial role in urban transportation. Identifying anomalies in these systems is essential for optimizing operations, improving service reliability, and enhancing user experience. This paper presents an interpretable anomaly detection framework that integrates multi-source data, including bike-sharing trip records, weather conditions, and public transit availability. The Isolation Forest algorithm is employed for unsupervised anomaly detection, along with the Depth-based Isolation Forest Feature Importance (DIFFI) algorithm providing interpretability. Results show that station-level analysis offers a robust understanding of anomalies, highlighting the influence of external factors such as adverse weather and limited transit availability. Our findings contribute to improving decision-making in shared mobility operations.

Abstract: The fundamental laws of physics are intrinsically geometric, dictating the evolution of systems through principles of symmetry and conservation. While modern machine learning offers powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics from data, common methods often ignore this underlying geometric fabric. Physics-informed neural networks, for instance, can violate fundamental physical principles, leading to predictions that are unstable over long periods, particularly for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Here, we introduce \textit{Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks (GeoHNN)}, a framework that learns dynamics by explicitly encoding the geometric priors inherent to physical laws. Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian geometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural mathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic geometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the preservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate through experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to high-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms existing models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy conservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a theoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and generalizable models of the physical world.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EV) charging stations are one of the critical infrastructures needed to support the transition to renewable-energy-based mobility, but ensuring their reliability and efficiency requires effective anomaly detection to identify irregularities in charging behavior. However, in such a productive scenario, it is also crucial to determine the underlying cause behind the detected anomalies. To achieve this goal, this study investigates unsupervised anomaly detection techniques for EV charging infrastructure, integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to enhance interpretability and uncover root causes of anomalies.
  Using real-world sensors and charging session data, this work applies Isolation Forest to detect anomalies and employs the Depth-based Isolation Forest Feature Importance (DIFFI) method to identify the most important features contributing to such anomalies. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated in a real industrial case.

arXiv:2507.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Vehicular communication systems operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band are highly susceptible to signal blockage from dynamic obstacles such as vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. To address this challenge, we propose a proactive blockage prediction framework that utilizes multi-modal sensing, including camera, GPS, LiDAR, and radar inputs in an infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) setting. This approach uses modality-specific deep learning models to process each sensor stream independently and fuses their outputs using a softmax-weighted ensemble strategy based on validation performance. Our evaluations, for up to 1.5s in advance, show that the camera-only model achieves the best standalone trade-off with an F1-score of 97.1% and an inference time of 89.8ms. A camera+radar configuration further improves accuracy to 97.2% F1 at 95.7ms. Our results display the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal sensing for mmWave blockage prediction and provide a pathway for proactive wireless communication in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches, DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses, including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment, fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.

Abstract: While boundaries between data modalities are vanishing, the usual successful deep models are still challenged by simple ones in the time-series forecasting task. Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones. Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use as the final predictor.

<title>Graph Attention Specialized Expert Fusion Model for Node Classification: Based on Cora and Pubmed Datasets</title>

Abstract: Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks (GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features.
  Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced, human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks. This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning (ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server. Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.

Abstract: To address the limitations of medium- and long-term four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction models, this paper proposes a hybrid CNN-LSTM-attention-adaboost neural network model incorporating a multi-strategy improved snake-herd optimization (SO) algorithm. The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.

<title>Optimizing Canaries for Privacy Auditing with Metagradient Descent</title>

Abstract: In this work we study black-box privacy auditing, where the goal is to lower bound the privacy parameter of a differentially private learning algorithm using only the algorithm's outputs (i.e., final trained model). For DP-SGD (the most successful method for training differentially private deep learning models), the canonical approach auditing uses membership inference-an auditor comes with a small set of special "canary" examples, inserts a random subset of them into the training set, and then tries to discern which of their canaries were included in the training set (typically via a membership inference attack). The auditor's success rate then provides a lower bound on the privacy parameters of the learning algorithm. Our main contribution is a method for optimizing the auditor's canary set to improve privacy auditing, leveraging recent work on metagradient optimization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that by using such optimized canaries, we can improve empirical lower bounds for differentially private image classification models by over 2x in certain instances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is transferable and efficient: canaries optimized for non-private SGD with a small model architecture remain effective when auditing larger models trained with DP-SGD.

<title>FASTGEN: Fast and Cost-Effective Synthetic Tabular Data Generation with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields. However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast, cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script. By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.

<title>GUI-G$^2$: Gaussian Reward Modeling for GUI Grounding</title>

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.

<title>Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique widely used in brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications, yet existing EEG foundation models face limitations in modeling spatio-temporal brain dynamics and lack channel permutation equivariance, preventing robust generalization across diverse electrode configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DIVER-0, a novel EEG foundation model that demonstrates how full spatio-temporal attention-rather than segregated spatial or temporal processing-achieves superior performance when properly designed with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for temporal relationships and binary attention biases for channel differentiation. We also introduce Sliding Temporal Conditional Positional Encoding (STCPE), which improves upon existing conditional positional encoding approaches by maintaining both temporal translation equivariance and channel permutation equivariance, enabling robust adaptation to arbitrary electrode configurations unseen during pretraining. Experimental results demonstrate that DIVER-0 achieves competitive performance with only 10% of pretraining data while maintaining consistent results across all channel permutation conditions, validating its effectiveness for cross-dataset generalization and establishing key design principles for handling the inherent heterogeneity of neural recording setups.

Abstract: Insomnia affects a vast population of the world and can have a wide range of causes. Existing treatments for insomnia have been linked with many side effects like headaches, dizziness, etc. As such, there is a clear need for improved insomnia treatment. Brain modelling has helped with assessing the effects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting clinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc. However, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this project attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals experiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks are derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG channels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the major brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with insomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance. Results indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most suitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification accuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the omission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in model performance than the removal of other channels. These channel electrodes are positioned near brain regions known to exhibit atypical levels of functional connectivity in individuals with insomnia, which can explain such results.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale machine learning models trained on extensive, diverse datasets that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. In the last two years, interest in FMs has also grown for applications in the cardiological field to analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. One of the key properties of FMs is their transferability to a wide range of downstream scenarios. With the spread of wearable and portable devices, keen interest in learning from reduced-channel configurations has arisen. However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream scenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated. In this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that makes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input channels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce Random Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a more robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five reduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly enhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It requires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about 17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time.

<title>Machine learning-enabled river water quality monitoring using lithography-free 3D-printed sensors</title>

Abstract: River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3, zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and ultimately improve public health.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges in diagnosis and monitoring due to its progressive nature and complex symptoms. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively assess PD severity, focusing on the biceps brachii muscle. Initial analysis of sEMG data from five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant neuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional Network-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%. Despite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed experimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate these findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed approach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving patient care in Parkinson's disease management.

<title>The Free Will Equation: Quantum Field Analogies for AGI</title>

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet, human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy diversity compared to baseline methods.

<title>Siamese Neural Network for Label-Efficient Critical Phenomena Prediction in 3D Percolation Models</title>

Abstract: Percolation theory serves as a cornerstone for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena, with broad implications in statistical physics, materials science, and complex networks. However, most machine learning frameworks for percolation analysis have focused on two-dimensional systems, oversimplifying the spatial correlations and morphological complexity of real-world three-dimensional materials. To bridge this gap and improve label efficiency and scalability in 3D systems, we propose a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that leverages features of the largest cluster as discriminative input. Our method achieves high predictive accuracy for both site and bond percolation thresholds and critical exponents in three dimensions, with sub-1% error margins using significantly fewer labeled samples than traditional approaches. This work establishes a robust and data-efficient framework for modeling high-dimensional critical phenomena, with potential applications in materials discovery and complex network analysis.

Abstract: Survival modeling predicts the time until an event occurs and is widely used in risk analysis; for example, it's used in medicine to predict the survival of a patient based on censored data. There is a need for large-scale, realistic, and freely available datasets for benchmarking artificial intelligence (AI) survival models. In this paper, we derive a suite of 16 survival modeling tasks from publicly available transaction data generated by lending of cryptocurrencies in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Each task was constructed using an automated pipeline based on choices of index and outcome events. For example, the model predicts the time from when a user borrows cryptocurrency coins (index event) until their first repayment (outcome event). We formulate a survival benchmark consisting of a suite of 16 survival-time prediction tasks (FinSurvival). We also automatically create 16 corresponding classification problems for each task by thresholding the survival time using the restricted mean survival time. With over 7.5 million records, FinSurvival provides a suite of realistic financial modeling tasks that will spur future AI survival modeling research. Our evaluation indicated that these are challenging tasks that are not well addressed by existing methods. FinSurvival enables the evaluation of AI survival models applicable to traditional finance, industry, medicine, and commerce, which is currently hindered by the lack of large public datasets. Our benchmark demonstrates how AI models could assess opportunities and risks in DeFi. In the future, the FinSurvival benchmark pipeline can be used to create new benchmarks by incorporating more DeFi transactions and protocols as the use of cryptocurrency grows.

Abstract: This study integrates causal inference, graph analysis, temporal complexity measures, and machine learning to examine whether individual symptom trajectories can reveal meaningful diagnostic patterns. Testing on a longitudinal dataset of N=45 individuals affected by General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) derived from Fisher et al. 2017, we propose a novel pipeline for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of psychopathological symptoms. First, we employ the PCMCI+ algorithm with nonparametric independence test to determine the causal network of nonlinear dependencies between symptoms in individuals with different mental disorders. We found that the PCMCI+ effectively highlights the individual peculiarities of each symptom network, which could be leveraged towards personalized therapies. At the same time, aggregating the networks by diagnosis sheds light to disorder-specific causal mechanisms, in agreement with previous psychopathological literature. Then, we enrich the dataset by computing complexity-based measures (e.g. entropy, fractal dimension, recurrence) from the symptom time series, and feed it to a suitably selected machine learning algorithm to aid the diagnosis of each individual. The new dataset yields 91% accuracy in the classification of the symptom dynamics, proving to be an effective diagnostic support tool. Overall, these findings highlight how integrating causal modeling and temporal complexity can enhance diagnostic differentiation, offering a principled, data-driven foundation for both personalized assessment in clinical psychology and structural advances in psychological research.

Abstract: We present UniPhyNet, a novel neural network architecture to classify cognitive load using multimodal physiological data -- specifically EEG, ECG and EDA signals -- without the explicit need for extracting hand-crafted features. UniPhyNet integrates multiscale parallel convolutional blocks and ResNet-type blocks enhanced with channel block attention module to focus on the informative features while a bidirectional gated recurrent unit is used to capture temporal dependencies. This architecture processes and combines signals in both unimodal and multimodal configurations via intermediate fusion of learned feature maps.

Abstract: In the field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), effectively reducing noise in intra-cardiac signals is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. However, traditional noise reduction techniques fall short in addressing the diverse noise patterns from various sources, often non-linear and non-stationary, present in these signals. This work introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, aimed at improving the quality of intra-ventricular monophasic action potential (MAP) signal recordings. By constructing representations of clean signals from a dataset of 5706 time series from 42 patients diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, our approach demonstrates superior denoising performance when compared to conventional filtering methods commonly employed in clinical settings. We assess the effectiveness of our VAE model using various metrics, indicating its superior capability to denoise signals across different noise types, including time-varying non-linear noise frequently found in clinical settings. These results reveal that VAEs can eliminate diverse sources of noise in single beats, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising techniques and potentially improving treatment efficacy in cardiac EP.

Abstract: Preclinical sleep research remains constrained by labor intensive, manual vigilance state classification and inter rater variability, limiting throughput and reproducibility. This study presents an automated framework developed by Team Neural Prognosticators to classify electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of small rodents into three critical vigilance states paradoxical sleep (REM), slow wave sleep (SWS), and wakefulness. The system integrates advanced signal processing with machine learning, leveraging engineered features from both time and frequency domains, including spectral power across canonical EEG bands (delta to gamma), temporal dynamics via Maximum-Minimum Distance, and cross-frequency coupling metrics. These features capture distinct neurophysiological signatures such as high frequency desynchronization during wakefulness, delta oscillations in SWS, and REM specific bursts. Validated during the 2024 Big Data Health Science Case Competition (University of South Carolina Big Data Health Science Center, 2024), our XGBoost model achieved 91.5% overall accuracy, 86.8% precision, 81.2% recall, and an F1 score of 83.5%, outperforming all baseline methods. Our approach represents a critical advancement in automated sleep state classification and a valuable tool for accelerating discoveries in sleep science and the development of targeted interventions for chronic sleep disorders. As a publicly available code (BDHSC) resource is set to contribute significantly to advancements.

Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Human computer interaction has become integral to modern life, driven by advancements in machine learning technologies. Affective computing, in particular, has focused on systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions, often using wearable devices, which provide continuous data streams of physiological signals. Among various physiological signals, the photoplethysmogram (PPG) has gained prominence due to its ease of acquisition from widely available devices. However, the generalization of PPG-based emotion recognition models across individuals remains an unresolved challenge. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to address this issue. The proposed model integrates the strengths of these architectures to improve robustness and generalization. Raw PPG signals are fed into the CNN for feature extraction. These features are processed separately by LSTM and TCN. The outputs from these components are concatenated to generate a final feature representation, which serves as the input for classifying valence and arousal, the primary dimensions of emotion. Experiments using the Photoplethysmogram Dataset for Emotional Analysis (PPGE) demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves better model generalization than standalone CNN and LSTM architectures. Our results show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN architecture, as well as a CNN-LSTM model, in emotion recognition tasks with PPG signals. Using metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1 Score, we highlight the model's effectiveness in handling subject variability.

Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving 73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable and personalized health monitoring.

Abstract: Latent spaces offer an efficient and effective means of summarizing data while implicitly preserving meta-information through relational encoding. We leverage these meta-embeddings to develop a modality-agnostic, unified encoder. Our method employs sensor-latent fusion to analyze and correlate multimodal physiological signals. Using a compressed sensing approach with autoencoder-based latent space fusion, we address the computational challenges of biosignal analysis on resource-constrained devices. Experimental results show that our unified encoder is significantly faster, lighter, and more scalable than modality-specific alternatives, without compromising representational accuracy.

<title>A Disentangled Representation Learning Framework for Low-altitude Network Coverage Prediction</title>

Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors. While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB level.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for pattern prediction and system prognostics centered on Spatiotemporal Permutation Entropy analysis integrated with Boosted Enhanced Quantile Regression Neural Networks (BEQRNNs). We address the challenge of understanding complex dynamical patterns in multidimensional systems through an approach that combines entropy-based complexity measures with advanced neural architectures. The system leverages dual computational stages: first implementing spatiotemporal entropy extraction optimized for multiscale temporal and spatial data streams, followed by an integrated BEQRNN layer that enables probabilistic pattern prediction with uncertainty quantification. This architecture achieves 81.17% accuracy in spatiotemporal pattern classification with prediction horizons up to 200 time steps and maintains robust performance across diverse regimes. Field testing across chaotic attractors, reaction-diffusion systems, and industrial datasets shows a 79% increase in critical transition detection accuracy and 81.22% improvement in long-term prediction reliability. The framework's effectiveness in processing complex, multimodal entropy features demonstrates significant potential for real-time prognostic applications.

Abstract: Radar technology presents untapped potential for continuous, contactless, and passive heart rate monitoring via consumer electronics like mobile phones. However the variety of available radar systems and lack of standardization means that a large new paired dataset collection is required for each radar system. This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems, both increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a continuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW radar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3 receiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz bandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119 participants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained performance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate ranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model, trained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376, avg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach yielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE reduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning between radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate its introduction into existing consumer devices.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Differentiating wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is clinically critical yet challenging due to morphological similarities in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals between life-threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SVT-A). Misdiagnosis carries fatal risks. We propose a computationally efficient deep learning solution to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide model interpretability for clinical deployment.
  Methods: A novel lightweight parallel deep architecture is introduced. Each pipeline processes individual ECG leads using two 1D-CNN blocks to extract local features. Feature maps are concatenated across leads, followed by LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies. Final classification employs fully connected layers. Explainability is achieved via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for local/global interpretation. The model was evaluated on a 35-subject ECG database using standard performance metrics.
  Results: The model achieved $95.63\%$ accuracy ($95\%$ CI: $93.07-98.19\%$), with sensitivity=$95.10\%$, specificity=$96.06\%$, and F1-score=$95.12\%$. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring minimal CNN blocks per pipeline. SHAP analysis demonstrated clinically interpretable feature contributions.
  Conclusions: Our end-to-end framework delivers high-precision WCT classification with minimal computational overhead. The integration of SHAP enhances clinical trust by elucidating decision logic, supporting rapid, informed diagnosis. This approach shows significant promise for real-world ECG analysis tools.

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this, we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%) across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/SMACS.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram~(ECG), a key bioelectrical time-series signal, is crucial for assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various diseases. Given its time-series format, ECG data is often incorporated into pre-training datasets for large-scale time-series model training. However, existing studies often overlook its unique characteristics and specialized downstream applications, which differ significantly from other time-series data, leading to an incomplete understanding of its properties. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of ECG signals and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which includes (1) categorizing its downstream applications into four distinct evaluation tasks, (2) identifying limitations in traditional evaluation metrics for ECG analysis, and introducing a novel metric; (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art time-series models and proposing a new architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is comprehensive and robust. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and model architecture, which establish a solid foundation for advancing research in ECG signal analysis.

<title>Distributed Machine Learning Approach for Low-Latency Localization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>

Abstract: Low-latency localization is critical in cellular networks to support real-time applications requiring precise positioning. In this paper, we propose a distributed machine learning (ML) framework for fingerprint-based localization tailored to cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, an emerging architecture for 6G networks. The proposed framework enables each access point (AP) to independently train a Gaussian process regression model using local angle-of-arrival and received signal strength fingerprints. These models provide probabilistic position estimates for the user equipment (UE), which are then fused by the UE with minimal computational overhead to derive a final location estimate. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for fronthaul communication between the APs and the central processing unit (CPU), thereby reducing latency. Additionally, distributing computational tasks across the APs alleviates the processing burden on the CPU compared to traditional centralized localization schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to centralized methods, despite lacking the benefits of centralized data aggregation. Moreover, it effectively reduces uncertainty of the location estimates, as evidenced by the 95\% covariance ellipse. The results highlight the potential of distributed ML for enabling low-latency, high-accuracy localization in future 6G networks.

<title>Cognitive Castes: Artificial Intelligence, Epistemic Stratification, and the Dissolution of Democratic Discourse</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence functions not as an epistemic leveller, but as an accelerant of cognitive stratification, entrenching and formalising informational castes within liberal-democratic societies. Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation, whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued. Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy as a civic mandate, codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure.

<title>Advanced Space Mapping Technique Integrating a Shared Coarse Model for Multistate Tuning-Driven Multiphysics Optimization of Tunable Filters</title>

Abstract: This article introduces an advanced space mapping (SM) technique that applies a shared electromagnetic (EM)-based coarse model for multistate tuning-driven multiphysics optimization of tunable filters. The SM method combines the computational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of multiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics responses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values. Conversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of multiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter values. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate models, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping neural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM single-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in the multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate transition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each subsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but possesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple subsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each tuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning states, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their respective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts for all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state requirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated concurrently to develop the surrogate model. Compared with existing direct multiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves superior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The automated summarisation of parliamentary debates using large language models (LLMs) offers a promising way to make complex legislative discourse more accessible to the public. However, such summaries must not only be accurate and concise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all speakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from the European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational biases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage summarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity, while enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as speaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and accuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments using both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent positional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically under-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary by model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the greatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for domain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of LLMs for democratic applications.

Abstract: Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.

Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA, DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized (BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to support early bipolar disorder screening.

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between voter trust and their experiences during elections by applying a rule-based data mining technique to the 2022 Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE). Using the Apriori algorithm and setting parameters to capture meaningful associations (support >= 3%, confidence >= 60%, and lift > 1.5), the analysis revealed a strong connection between demographic attributes and voting-related challenges, such as registration hurdles, accessibility issues, and queue times. For instance, respondents who indicated that accessing polling stations was "very easy" and who reported moderate confidence were found to be over six times more likely (lift = 6.12) to trust their county's election outcome and experience no registration issues. A further analysis, which adjusted the support threshold to 2%, specifically examined patterns among minority voters. It revealed that 98.16 percent of Black voters who reported easy access to polling locations also had smooth registration experiences. Additionally, those who had high confidence in the vote-counting process were almost two times as likely to identify as Democratic Party supporters. These findings point to the important role that enhancing voting access and offering targeted support can play in building trust in the electoral system, particularly among marginalized communities.

Abstract: Vision transformer (ViT) models, when coupled with interpretation models, are regarded as secure and challenging to deceive, making them well-suited for security-critical domains such as medical applications, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics. However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76% misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more difficult to detect.

Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69\% test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities are envisioned to play a pivotal role in future wireless networks due to their enhanced flexibility and efficiency. However, jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, multi-user communication, and target sensing under stringent resource constraints and time-critical conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an Age of Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs target sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information freshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI minimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and beamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of providing real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar sensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed for accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to mitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is applied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed framework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and communication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: Most current machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) rely on short-range approximations, without explicit treatment of long-range electrostatics. To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization, and Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force training data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with any short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as MACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct systems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on defective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct electrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large and chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing molecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic systems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its short-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts dipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids. By enabling efficient long-range electrostatics without directly training on electrical properties, LES paves the way for electrostatic foundation MLIPs.

<title>Aligning Large Language Models to Low-Resource Languages through LLM-Based Selective Translation: A Systematic Study</title>

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their potential without compromising self-determination.

<title>Topological Social Choice: Designing a Noise-Robust Polar Distance for Persistence Diagrams</title>

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful framework for extracting robust and interpretable features from noisy high-dimensional data. In the context of Social Choice Theory, where preference profiles and collective decisions are geometrically rich yet sensitive to perturbations, TDA remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a novel conceptual bridge between these domains by proposing a new metric framework for persistence diagrams tailored to noisy preference data.We define a polar coordinate-based distance that captures both the magnitude and orientation of topological features in a smooth and differentiable manner. Our metric addresses key limitations of classical distances, such as bottleneck and Wasserstein, including instability under perturbation, lack of continuity, and incompatibility with gradient-based learning. The resulting formulation offers improved behavior in both theoretical and applied settings.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically apply persistent homology to social choice systems, providing a mathematically grounded method for comparing topological summaries of voting structures and preference dynamics. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments, including robustness tests and supervised learning tasks, and we propose a modular pipeline for building predictive models from online preference data. This work contributes a conceptually novel and computationally effective tool to the emerging interface of topology and decision theory, opening new directions in interpretable machine learning for political and economic systems.

<title>MENO: Hybrid Matrix Exponential-based Neural Operator for Stiff ODEs. Application to Thermochemical Kinetics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14341</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.14341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MENO (''Matrix Exponential-based Neural Operator''), a hybrid surrogate modeling framework for efficiently solving stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that exhibit a sparse nonlinear structure. In such systems, only a few variables contribute nonlinearly to the dynamics, while the majority influence the equations linearly. MENO exploits this property by decomposing the system into two components: the low-dimensional nonlinear part is modeled using conventional neural operators, while the linear time-varying subsystem is integrated using a novel neural matrix exponential formulation. This approach combines the exact solution of linear time-invariant systems with learnable, time-dependent graph-based corrections applied to the linear operators. Unlike black-box or soft-constrained physics-informed (PI) models, MENO embeds the governing equations directly into its architecture, ensuring physical consistency (e.g., steady states), improved robustness, and more efficient training. We validate MENO on three complex thermochemical systems: the POLLU atmospheric chemistry model, an oxygen mixture in thermochemical nonequilibrium, and a collisional-radiative argon plasma in one- and two-dimensional shock-tube simulations. MENO achieves relative errors below 2% in trained zero-dimensional settings and maintains good accuracy in extrapolatory multidimensional regimes. It also delivers substantial computational speedups, achieving up to 4 800$\times$ on GPU and 185$\times$ on CPU compared to standard implicit ODE solvers. Although intrusive by design, MENO's physics-based architecture enables superior generalization and reliability, offering a scalable path for real-time simulation of stiff reactive systems.

Abstract: Schema matching is essential for integrating heterogeneous data sources and enhancing dataset discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive problem. We introduce SCHEMORA, a schema matching framework that combines large language models with hybrid retrieval techniques in a prompt-based approach, enabling efficient identification of candidate matches without relying on labeled training data or exhaustive pairwise comparisons. By enriching schema metadata and leveraging both vector-based and lexical retrieval, SCHEMORA improves matching accuracy and scalability. Evaluated on the MIMIC-OMOP benchmark, it establishes new state-of-the-art performance, with gains of 7.49% in HitRate@5 and 3.75% in HitRate@3 over previous best results. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based schema matching method with an open-source implementation, accompanied by analysis that underscores the critical role of retrieval and provides practical guidance on model selection.

<title>Fail Fast, or Ask: Mitigating the Deficiencies of Reasoning LLMs with Human-in-the-Loop Systems Engineering</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3 235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring 7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask", since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.

Abstract: As a paradigm for sequential decision making in unknown environments, reinforcement learning (RL) has received a flurry of attention in recent years. However, the explosion of model complexity in emerging applications and the presence of nonconvexity exacerbate the challenge of achieving efficient RL in sample-starved situations, where data collection is expensive, time-consuming, or even high-stakes (e.g., in clinical trials, autonomous systems, and online advertising). How to understand and enhance the sample and computational efficacies of RL algorithms is thus of great interest. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce several important algorithmic and theoretical developments in RL, highlighting the connections between new ideas and classical topics. Employing Markov Decision Processes as the central mathematical model, we cover several distinctive RL scenarios (i.e., RL with a simulator, online RL, offline RL, robust RL, and RL with human feedback), and present several mainstream RL approaches (i.e., model-based approach, value-based approach, and policy optimization). Our discussions gravitate around the issues of sample complexity, computational efficiency, as well as algorithm-dependent and information-theoretic lower bounds from a non-asymptotic viewpoint.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel neural network model for learning stochastic Hamiltonian systems (SHSs) from observational data, termed the stochastic generating function neural network (SGFNN). SGFNN preserves symplectic structure of the underlying stochastic Hamiltonian system and produces symplectic predictions. Our model utilizes the autoencoder framework to identify the randomness of the latent system by the encoder network, and detects the stochastic generating function of the system through the decoder network based on the random variables extracted from the encoder. Symplectic predictions can then be generated by the stochastic generating function. Numerical experiments are performed on several stochastic Hamiltonian systems, varying from additive to multiplicative, and from separable to non-separable SHSs with single or multiple noises. Compared with the benchmark stochastic flow map learning (sFML) neural network, our SGFNN model exhibits higher accuracy across various prediction metrics, especially in long-term predictions, with the property of maintaining the symplectic structure of the underlying SHSs.

Abstract: In many applications, one needs to learn a dynamical system from its solutions sampled at a finite number of time points. The learning problem is often formulated
  as an optimization problem over a chosen function class. However, in the optimization procedure, it is necessary to employ a numerical scheme to integrate candidate dynamical systems and assess how their solutions fit the data.
  This paper reveals potentially serious effects of a chosen numerical scheme on the learning outcome. In particular, our analysis demonstrates that a damped oscillatory system may be incorrectly identified as having "anti-damping" and exhibiting a reversed oscillation direction, despite adequately fitting the given data points.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural-Brownian Motion (NBM), a new class of stochastic processes for modeling dynamics under learned uncertainty. The NBM is defined axiomatically by replacing the classical martingale property with respect to linear expectation with one relative to a non-linear Neural Expectation Operator, $\varepsilon^\theta$, generated by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) whose driver $f_\theta$ is parameterized by a neural network. Our main result is a representation theorem for a canonical NBM, which we define as a continuous $\varepsilon^\theta$-martingale with zero drift under the physical measure. We prove that, under a key structural assumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\rm d} M_t = \nu_\theta(t, M_t) {\rm d} W_t$. Crucially, the volatility function $\nu_\theta$ is not postulated a priori but is implicitly defined by the algebraic constraint $g_\theta(t, M_t, \nu_\theta(t, M_t)) = 0$, where $g_\theta$ is a specialization of the BSDE driver. We develop the stochastic calculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic case, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The character of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously determined by the learned parameters $\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation for models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature.

Abstract: Diffusion models, initially developed for image synthesis, demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. In this survey, we firstly introduce the standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. We then provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss current limitations in these approaches and potential future research directions. Overall, this survey details recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a reference for researchers in the field.

Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will be used.

Abstract: This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors. This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space, and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion modeling in artificial intelligence systems.

<title>Towards a Proactive Autoscaling Framework for Data Stream Processing at the Edge using GRU and Transfer Learning</title>

Abstract: Processing data at high speeds is becoming increasingly critical as digital economies generate enormous data. The current paradigms for timely data processing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing places resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing analyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream processing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource provisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas excess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as threshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance degrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime adaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive machine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that minimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge stream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts the upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a transfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online stream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution adaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains. Finally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of operator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource constraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to 1.3\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and Prophet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than the computationally intensive RL models.

Abstract: Neural IR architectures, particularly cross-encoders, are highly effective models whose internal mechanisms are mostly unknown. Most works trying to explain their behavior focused on high-level processes (e.g., what in the input influences the prediction, does the model adhere to known IR axioms) but fall short of describing the matching process. Instead of Mechanistic Interpretability approaches which specifically aim at explaining the hidden mechanisms of neural models, we demonstrate that more straightforward methods can already provide valuable insights. In this paper, we first focus on the attention process and extract causal insights highlighting the crucial roles of some attention heads in this process. Second, we provide an interpretation of the mechanism underlying matching detection.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing, medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer. Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW. The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%, respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for practical facial expression recognition applications.

Abstract: The development of satellite-augmented low-altitude economy and terrestrial networks (SLAETNs) demands intelligent and autonomous systems that can operate reliably across heterogeneous, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. To address these challenges, this survey focuses on enabling agentic artificial intelligence (AI), that is, artificial agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting, through generative AI (GAI) and large language models (LLMs). We begin by introducing the architecture and characteristics of SLAETNs, and analyzing the challenges that arise in integrating satellite, aerial, and terrestrial components. Then, we present a model-driven foundation by systematically reviewing five major categories of generative models: variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), generative diffusion models (GDMs), transformer-based models (TBMs), and LLMs. Moreover, we provide a comparative analysis to highlight their generative mechanisms, capabilities, and deployment trade-offs within SLAETNs. Building on this foundation, we examine how these models empower agentic functions across three domains: communication enhancement, security and privacy protection, and intelligent satellite tasks. Finally, we outline key future directions for building scalable, adaptive, and trustworthy generative agents in SLAETNs. This survey aims to provide a unified understanding and actionable reference for advancing agentic AI in next-generation integrated networks.

Abstract: Kinetic parameters such as the turnover number ($k_{cat}$) and Michaelis constant ($K_{\mathrm{M}}$) are essential for modelling enzymatic activity but experimental data remains limited in scale and diversity. Previous methods for predicting enzyme kinetics typically use mean-pooled residue embeddings from a single protein language model to represent the protein. We present KinForm, a machine learning framework designed to improve predictive accuracy and generalisation for kinetic parameters by optimising protein feature representations. KinForm combines several residue-level embeddings (Evolutionary Scale Modeling Cambrian, Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2, and ProtT5-XL-UniRef50), taken from empirically selected intermediate transformer layers and applies weighted pooling based on per-residue binding-site probability. To counter the resulting high dimensionality, we apply dimensionality reduction using principal--component analysis (PCA) on concatenated protein features, and rebalance the training data via a similarity-based oversampling strategy. KinForm outperforms baseline methods on two benchmark datasets. Improvements are most pronounced in low sequence similarity bins. We observe improvements from binding-site probability pooling, intermediate-layer selection, PCA, and oversampling of low-identity proteins. We also find that removing sequence overlap between folds provides a more realistic evaluation of generalisation and should be the standard over random splitting when benchmarking kinetic prediction models.

It introduces copula-based activation functions (Clayton, Gumbel, and their combinations) to model the nonlinear dependencies inherent in such data. Through simulation studies and analysis of real breast cancer data, our proposed CNN-LSTM with copula-based activation functions for multivariate multi-types of survival responses enhances prediction accuracy by explicitly addressing right-censored data and capturing complex patterns. The model's performance is evaluated using Shewhart control charts, focusing on the average run length (ARL).

Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful and accurate method to sample from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. However, HMC techniques are computationally demanding for Bayesian neural networks due to the high dimensionality of the network's parameter space and the non-convexity of their posterior distributions. Therefore, various approximation techniques, such as variational inference (VI) or stochastic gradient MCMC, are often employed to infer the posterior distribution of the network parameters. Such approximations introduce inaccuracies in the inferred distributions, resulting in unreliable uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines inexpensive VI and accurate HMC methods to efficiently and accurately quantify uncertainties in neural networks and neural operators. The proposed approach leverages an initial VI training on the full network. We examine the influence of individual parameters on the prediction uncertainty, which shows that a large proportion of the parameters do not contribute substantially to uncertainty in the network predictions. This information is then used to significantly reduce the dimension of the parameter space, and HMC is performed only for the subset of network parameters that strongly influence prediction uncertainties. This yields a framework for accelerating the full batch HMC for posterior inference in neural networks. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework on deep neural networks and operator networks, showing that inference can be performed for large networks with tens to hundreds of thousands of parameters. We show that this method can effectively learn surrogates for complex physical systems by modeling the operator that maps from upstream conditions to wall-pressure data on a cone in hypersonic flow.

Abstract: Popular methods in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with partially observable environments typically allow agents to act independently during execution, which may limit the coordinated effect of the trained policies. However, by sharing information such as known or suspected ongoing threats, effective communication can lead to improved decision-making in the cyber battle space. We propose a game design where defender agents learn to communicate and defend against imminent cyber threats by playing training games in the Cyber Operations Research Gym, using the Differentiable Inter Agent Learning algorithm adapted to the cyber operational environment. The tactical policies learned by these autonomous agents are akin to those of human experts during incident responses to avert cyber threats. In addition, the agents simultaneously learn minimal cost communication messages while learning their defence tactical policies.

<title>When few labeled target data suffice: a theory of semi-supervised domain adaptation via fine-tuning from multiple adaptive starts</title>

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims to achieve high predictive performance in the target domain with limited labeled target data by exploiting abundant source and unlabeled target data. Despite its significance in numerous applications, theory on the effectiveness of SSDA remains largely unexplored, particularly in scenarios involving various types of source-target distributional shifts. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on structural causal models (SCMs) which allows us to analyze and quantify the performance of SSDA methods when labeled target data is limited. Within this framework, we introduce three SSDA methods, each having a fine-tuning strategy tailored to a distinct assumption about the source and target relationship. Under each assumption, we demonstrate how extending an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method to SSDA can achieve minimax-optimal target performance with limited target labels. When the relationship between source and target data is only vaguely known -- a common practical concern -- we propose the Multi Adaptive-Start Fine-Tuning (MASFT) algorithm, which fine-tunes UDA models from multiple starting points and selects the best-performing one based on a small hold-out target validation dataset. Combined with model selection guarantees, MASFT achieves near-optimal target predictive performance across a broad range of types of distributional shifts while significantly reducing the need for labeled target data. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through simulations.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset development.

<title>Rethinking Suicidal Ideation Detection: A Trustworthy Annotation Framework and Cross-Lingual Model Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP) while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model reliability.

Abstract: Faculty hiring shapes the flow of ideas, resources, and opportunities in academia, influencing not only individual career trajectories but also broader patterns of institutional prestige and scientific progress. While traditional studies have found strong correlations between faculty hiring and attributes such as doctoral department prestige and publication record, they rarely assess whether these associations generalize to individual hiring outcomes, particularly for future candidates outside the original sample. Here, we consider faculty placement as an individual-level prediction task. Our data consist of temporal co-authorship networks with conventional attributes such as doctoral department prestige and bibliometric features. We observe that using the co-authorship network significantly improves predictive accuracy by up to 10% over traditional indicators alone, with the largest gains observed for placements at the most elite (top-10) departments. Our results underscore the role that social networks, professional endorsements, and implicit advocacy play in faculty hiring beyond traditional measures of scholarly productivity and institutional prestige. By introducing a predictive framing of faculty placement and establishing the benefit of considering co-authorship networks, this work provides a new lens for understanding structural biases in academia that could inform targeted interventions aimed at increasing transparency, fairness, and equity in academic hiring practices.

<title>QUTCC: Quantile Uncertainty Training and Conformal Calibration for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models often hallucinate, producing realistic artifacts that are not truly present in the sample. This can have dire consequences for scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising, where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability. However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding, QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage.

Abstract: Causality helps people reason about and understand complex systems, particularly through what-if analyses that explore how interventions might alter outcomes. Although existing methods embrace causal reasoning using interventions and counterfactual analysis, they primarily focus on effects at the population level. These approaches often fall short in systems characterized by significant heterogeneity, where the impact of an intervention can vary widely across subgroups. To address this challenge, we present XplainAct, a visual analytics framework that supports simulating, explaining, and reasoning interventions at the individual level within subpopulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of XplainAct through two case studies: investigating opioid-related deaths in epidemiology and analyzing voting inclinations in the presidential election.

Abstract: Motivated by federated learning (FL), secure aggregation (SA) aims to securely compute, as efficiently as possible, the sum of a set of inputs distributed across many users. To understand the impact of network topology, hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) investigated the communication and secret key generation efficiency in a 3-layer relay network, where clusters of users are connected to the aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Due to the pre-aggregation of the messages at the relays, HSA reduces the communication burden on the relay-to-server links and is able to support a large number of users. However, as the number of users increases, a practical challenge arises from heterogeneous security requirements--for example, users in different clusters may require varying levels of input protection. Motivated by this, we study weakly-secure HSA (WS-HSA) with collusion resilience, where instead of protecting all the inputs from any set of colluding users, only the inputs belonging to a predefined collection of user groups (referred to as security input sets) need to be protected against another predefined collection of user groups (referred to as collusion sets). Since the security input sets and collusion sets can be arbitrarily defined, our formulation offers a flexible framework for addressing heterogeneous security requirements in HSA. We characterize the optimal total key rate, i.e., the total number of independent key symbols required to ensure both server and relay security, for a broad range of parameter configurations. For the remaining cases, we establish lower and upper bounds on the optimal key rate, providing constant-factor gap optimality guarantees.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) surrogate models are increasingly used in engineering analysis and design to replace computationally expensive simulation models, significantly reducing computational cost and accelerating decision-making processes. However, ML predictions contain inherent errors, often estimated as model uncertainty, which is coupled with variability in model inputs. Accurately quantifying and propagating these combined uncertainties is essential for generating reliable engineering predictions. This paper presents a robust framework based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) to handle joint input and model uncertainty propagation. While the approach applies broadly to general ML surrogates, we focus on Gaussian Process regression models, which provide explicit predictive distributions for model uncertainty. By transforming all random inputs into a unified standard space, a PCE surrogate model is constructed, allowing efficient and accurate calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the output. The proposed methodology also offers a mechanism for global sensitivity analysis, enabling the accurate quantification of the individual contributions of input variables and ML model uncertainty to the overall output variability. This approach provides a computationally efficient and interpretable framework for comprehensive uncertainty quantification, supporting trustworthy ML predictions in downstream engineering applications.

Abstract: Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have emerged as a prominent subclass of real-world assets (RWAs), offering cryptographically enforced, yield-bearing instruments collateralized by sovereign debt and deployed across multiple blockchain networks. While the market has expanded rapidly, empirical analyses of transaction-level behaviour remain limited. This paper conducts a quantitative, function-level dissection of U.S. Treasury-backed RWA tokens including BUIDL, BENJI, and USDY, across multi-chain: mostly Ethereum and Layer-2s. We analyze decoded contract calls to isolate core functional primitives such as issuance, redemption, transfer, and bridge activity, revealing segmentation in behaviour between institutional actors and retail users. To model address-level economic roles, we introduce a curvature-aware representation learning framework using Poincar\'e embeddings and liquidity-based graph features. Our method outperforms baseline models on our RWA Treasury dataset in role inference and generalizes to downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and wallet classification in broader blockchain transaction networks. These findings provide a structured understanding of functional heterogeneity and participant roles in tokenized Treasury in a transaction-level perspective, contributing new empirical evidence to the study of on-chain financialization.

Abstract: We study the problem of releasing a differentially private (DP) synthetic graph $G'$ that well approximates the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts of any given graph $G$, where a motif in general refers to a frequently occurring subgraph within complex networks. Non-private versions of such graphs have found applications in diverse fields such as graph clustering, graph sparsification, and social network analysis. Specifically, we present the first $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP mechanism that, given an input graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and local sensitivity of triangles $\ell_{3}(G)$, generates a synthetic graph $G'$ in polynomial time, approximating the triangle-motif sizes of all cuts $(S,V\setminus S)$ of the input graph $G$ up to an additive error of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m\ell_{3}(G)}n/\varepsilon^{3/2})$. Additionally, we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{mn}\ell_{3}(G)/\varepsilon)$ on the additive error for any DP algorithm that answers the triangle-motif size queries of all $(S,T)$-cut of $G$. Finally, our algorithm generalizes to weighted graphs, and our lower bound extends to any $K_h$-motif cut for any constant $h\geq 2$.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost. Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting, three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach for privacy-sensitive domains. Despite its potential, FL faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of communication overhead and data privacy. Privacy-preserving Techniques (PPTs) such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) have been used to mitigate these concerns. However, these techniques introduce substantial computational and communication costs, limiting their practical deployment. In this work, we explore how Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE), a cryptographic protocol that combines symmetric encryption with HE, can be effectively integrated with FL to address both communication and privacy challenges, paving the way for scalable and secure decentralized learning system.

Abstract: Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.

Abstract: This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms, showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.

Abstract: Patent examiners and inventors face significant pressure to verify the originality and non-obviousness of inventions, and the intricate nature of patent data intensifies the challenges of patent retrieval. Therefore, there is a pressing need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably achieve the desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent retrieval approach that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while maintaining the reliability of relevance matching and maximising recall. It leverages IPC-guided knowledge to generate informative phrases, which are processed to extract key information in the form of noun phrases characterising the query patent under observation. From these, the top k keyphrases are selected to construct a query for retrieving a focused subset of the dataset. This initial retrieval step achieves complete recall, successfully capturing all relevant documents. To further refine the results, a ranking scheme is applied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining 100% recall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for balancing precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with baseline studies, namely HRR2 [1] and ReQ-ReC [2]. The proposed approach yielded superior results, achieving 100% recall in all five test cases. However, HRR2[1] recall values across the five test cases were 10%, 25%, 33.3%, 0%, and 14.29%, while ReQ-ReC [2] showed 50% for the first test case, 25% for the second test case, and 0% for the third, fourth, and fifth test cases. The 100% recall ensures that no relevant prior art is overlooked, thereby strengthening the patent pre-filing and examination processes, hence reducing potential legal risks.

Abstract: The detection of outliers within cryptocurrency limit order books (LOBs) is of paramount importance for comprehending market dynamics, particularly in highly volatile and nascent regulatory environments. This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of robust statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques for real-time anomaly identification in cryptocurrency LOBs. Within a unified testing environment, named AITA Order Book Signal (AITA-OBS), we evaluate the efficacy of thirteen diverse models to identify which approaches are most suitable for detecting potentially manipulative trading behaviours. An empirical evaluation, conducted via backtesting on a dataset of 26,204 records from a major exchange, demonstrates that the top-performing model, Empirical Covariance (EC), achieves a 6.70% gain, significantly outperforming a standard Buy-and-Hold benchmark. These findings underscore the effectiveness of outlier-driven strategies and provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity, trade frequency, and performance. This study contributes to the growing corpus of research on cryptocurrency market microstructure by furnishing a rigorous benchmark of anomaly detection models and highlighting their potential for augmenting algorithmic trading and risk management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.} AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages: (1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals, while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on shallow refusal patterns.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts (e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual context in multimodal regression tasks.

<title>The Rise of AI Teammates in Software Engineering (SE) 3.0: How Autonomous Coding Agents Are Reshaping Software Engineering</title>

Abstract: The future of software engineering--SE 3.0--is unfolding with the rise of AI teammates: autonomous, goal-driven systems collaborating with human developers. Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across 61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development.
  Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics).
  We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/SAILResearch/AI_Teammates_in_SE3.

<title>Integrating Newton's Laws with deep learning for enhanced physics-informed compound flood modelling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15021</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coastal communities increasingly face compound floods, where multiple drivers like storm surge, high tide, heavy rainfall, and river discharge occur together or in sequence to produce impacts far greater than any single driver alone. Traditional hydrodynamic models can provide accurate physics-based simulations but require substantial computational resources for real-time applications or risk assessments, while machine learning alternatives often sacrifice physical consistency for speed, producing unrealistic predictions during extreme events. This study addresses these challenges by developing ALPINE (All-in-one Physics Informed Neural Emulator), a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework to enforce complete shallow water dynamics in compound flood modeling. Unlike previous approaches that implement partial constraints, our framework simultaneously enforces mass conservation and both momentum equations, ensuring full adherence to Newton's laws throughout the prediction process. The model integrates a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with ConvLSTM temporal processing, trained using a composite loss function that balances data fidelity with physics-based residuals. Using six historical storm events (four for training, one for validation, and one held-out for unseen testing), we observe substantial improvements over baseline neural networks. ALPINE reduces domain-averaged prediction errors and improves model skill metrics for water surface elevation and velocity components. Physics-informed constraints prove most valuable during peak storm intensity, when multiple flood drivers interact and reliable predictions matter most. This approach yields a physically consistent emulator capable of supporting compound-flood forecasting and large-scale risk analyses while preserving physical realism essential for coastal emergency management.

<title>The hunt for new pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources: a clustering approach</title>

Abstract: The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography (USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes 8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance, scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities. Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance. The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention. Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution. The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts. Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.

Abstract: Handheld grippers are increasingly used to collect human demonstrations due to their ease of deployment and versatility. However, most existing designs lack tactile sensing, despite the critical role of tactile feedback in precise manipulation. We present a portable, lightweight gripper with integrated tactile sensors that enables synchronized collection of visual and tactile data in diverse, real-world, and in-the-wild settings. Building on this hardware, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework that integrates visual and tactile signals while preserving their distinct characteristics. The learning procedure allows the emergence of interpretable representations that consistently focus on contacting regions relevant for physical interactions. When used for downstream manipulation tasks, these representations enable more efficient and effective policy learning, supporting precise robotic manipulation based on multimodal feedback. We validate our approach on fine-grained tasks such as test tube insertion and pipette-based fluid transfer, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under external disturbances.

Abstract: This paper explores the applications of quantum annealing (QA) and classical simulated annealing (SA) to a suite of combinatorial optimization problems in machine learning, namely feature selection, instance selection, and clustering. We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing (QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even within the constraints of current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Machine learning allows unfolding high-dimensional spaces without binning at the LHC. The new SPINUP method extracts the unfolded distribution based on a neural network encoding the forward mapping, making it independent of the prior from the simulated training data. It is made efficient through neural importance sampling, and ensembling can be used to estimate the effect of information loss in the forward process. We showcase SPINUP for unfolding detector effects on jet substructure observables and for unfolding to parton level of associated Higgs and single-top production.

<title>Learning under Latent Group Sparsity via Diffusion on Networks</title>

arXiv:2507.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group or cluster structure on explanatory variables in machine learning problems is a very general phenomenon, which has attracted broad interest from practitioners and theoreticians alike. In this work we contribute an approach to sparse learning under such group structure, that does not require prior information on the group identities. Our paradigm is motivated by the Laplacian geometry of an underlying network with a related community structure, and proceeds by directly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively computed via a heat-flow-based local network dynamics. The proposed penalty interpolates between the lasso and the group lasso penalties, the runtime of the heat-flow dynamics being the interpolating parameter. As such it can automatically default to lasso when the group structure reflected in the Laplacian is weak. In fact, we demonstrate a data-driven procedure to construct such a network based on the available data. Notably, we dispense with computationally intensive pre-processing involving clustering of variables, spectral or otherwise. Our technique is underpinned by rigorous theorems that guarantee its effective performance and provide bounds on its sample complexity. In particular, in a wide range of settings, it provably suffices to run the diffusion for time that is only logarithmic in the problem dimensions. We explore in detail the interfaces of our approach with key statistical physics models in network science, such as the Gaussian Free Field and the Stochastic Block Model. Our work raises the possibility of applying similar diffusion-based techniques to classical learning tasks, exploiting the interplay between geometric, dynamical and stochastic structures underlying the data.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors, LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/RovisLab/LoopNet. Additinally, we introduce a new loop closure benchmarking dataset, coined LoopDB, which is available at https://github.com/RovisLab/LoopDB.

Abstract: Goal: Epilepsy remains under-diagnosed in low-income countries due to scarce neurologists and costly diagnostic tools. We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools.

Abstract: This paper proposes a communication-efficient, event-triggered inference framework for cooperative edge AI systems comprising multiple user devices and edge servers. Building upon dual-threshold early-exit strategies for rare-event detection, the proposed approach extends classical single-device inference to a distributed, multi-device setting while incorporating proportional fairness constraints across users. A joint optimization framework is formulated to maximize classification utility under communication, energy, and fairness constraints. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we exploit the monotonicity of the utility function with respect to the confidence thresholds and apply alternating optimization with Benders decomposition. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances system-wide performance and fairness in resource allocation compared to single-device baselines.

Abstract: The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support, and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini) across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes, and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts) to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information. We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

Abstract: Multidimensional item response theory is a statistical test theory used to estimate the latent skills of learners and the difficulty levels of problems based on test results. Both compensatory and non-compensatory models have been proposed in the literature. Previous studies have revealed the substantial underestimation of higher skills when the non-compensatory model is misspecified as the compensatory model. However, the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated. It remains unclear whether overestimation also occurs and whether issues arise regarding the variance of the estimated parameters. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of both underestimation and overestimation through a theoretical approach. In addition to the previously identified underestimation of the skills, we newly discover that the overestimation of skills occurs around the origin. Furthermore, we investigate the extent to which the asymptotic variance of the estimated parameters differs when considering model misspecification compared to when it is not taken into account.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel, interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies. Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.

Abstract: Recent advances have sparked significant interest in the development of privacy-preserving Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, many existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as assuming sub-Gaussian data or being vulnerable to data contamination. Additionally, some methods are computationally expensive or depend on unknown model parameters that must be estimated, limiting their accessibility for data analysts seeking privacy-preserving PCA. In this paper, we propose a differentially private PCA method applicable to heavy-tailed and potentially contaminated data. Our approach leverages the property that the covariance matrix of properly rescaled data preserves eigenvectors and their order under elliptical distributions, which include Gaussian and heavy-tailed distributions. By applying a bounded transformation, we enable straightforward computation of principal components in a differentially private manner. Additionally, boundedness guarantees robustness against data contamination. We conduct both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of the proposed method, focusing on its ability to recover the subspace spanned by the leading principal components. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of statistical utility, particularly in non-Gaussian or contaminated data settings.

Abstract: The Design of Experiments (DOEs) is a fundamental scientific methodology that provides researchers with systematic principles and techniques to enhance the validity, reliability, and efficiency of experimental outcomes. In this study, we explore optimal experimental design within a Bayesian framework, utilizing Bayes' theorem to reformulate the utility expectation--originally expressed as a nested double integral--into an independent double integral form, significantly improving numerical efficiency. To further accelerate the computation of the proposed utility expectation, conditional density estimation is employed to approximate the ratio of two Gaussian random fields, while covariance serves as a selection criterion to identify informative datasets during model fitting and integral evaluation. In scenarios characterized by low simulation efficiency and high costs of raw data acquisition, key challenges such as surrogate modeling, failure probability estimation, and parameter inference are systematically restructured within the Bayesian experimental design framework. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated through both theoretical analysis and practical applications, demonstrating its potential for enhancing experimental efficiency and decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples, unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks (entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements. These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts. Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published at https://github.com/Naeem-Paeedeh/CPLSR.

<title>Disentangling Homophily and Heterophily in Multimodal Graph Clustering</title>

Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap. Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2) heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy, enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion. Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Uncnbb/DMGC.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular care, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and conduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals, diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable, multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.

Abstract: This letter develops a novel physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations-based framework to emulate the proprietary dynamics of the inverters -- essential for improved accuracy in grid dynamic simulations. In current industry practice, the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) often do not disclose the exact internal controls and parameters of the inverters, posing significant challenges in performing accurate dynamic simulations and other relevant studies, such as gain tunings for stability analysis and controls. To address this, we propose a Physics-Informed Latent Neural ODE Model (PI-LNM) that integrates system physics with neural learning layers to capture the unmodeled behaviors of proprietary units. The proposed method is validated using a grid-forming inverter (GFM) case study, demonstrating improved dynamic simulation accuracy over approaches that rely solely on data-driven learning without physics-based guidance.

Abstract: We study a nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem defined over nonconvex constraints, where the feasible set is given by the intersection of the closure of an open set and a smooth manifold. By endowing the open set with a Riemannian metric induced by a barrier function, we obtain a Riemannian subgradient flow formulated as a differential inclusion, which remains strictly within the interior of the feasible set. This continuous dynamical system unifies two classes of iterative optimization methods, namely the Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme, by revealing that these methods can be interpreted as discrete approximations of the continuous flow. We explore the long-term behavior of the trajectories generated by this dynamical system and show that the existing deficient convergence properties of the Hessian barrier and mirror descent scheme can be unifily and more insightfully interpreted through these of the continuous trajectory. For instance, the notorious spurious stationary points \cite{chen2024spurious} observed in Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme are interpreted as stable equilibria of the dynamical system that do not correspond to real stationary points of the original optimization problem. We provide two sufficient condition such that these spurious stationary points can be avoided if the strict complementarity conditions holds. In the absence of these regularity condition, we propose a random perturbation strategy that ensures the trajectory converges (subsequentially) to an approximate stationary point. Building on these insights, we introduce two iterative Riemannian subgradient methods, form of interior point methods, that generalizes the existing Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems.

<title>Language Generation in the Limit: Noise, Loss, and Feedback</title>

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed a formal framework called language generation in the limit and showed that given a sequence of example strings from an unknown target language drawn from any countable collection, an algorithm can correctly generate unseen strings from the target language within finite time. This notion was further refined by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024), who defined stricter categories of non-uniform and uniform generation. They showed that a finite union of uniformly generatable collections is generatable in the limit, and asked if the same is true for non-uniform generation.
  We begin by resolving the question in the negative: we give a uniformly generatable collection and a non-uniformly generatable collection whose union is not generatable in the limit. We then use facets of this construction to further our understanding of several variants of language generation. The first two, generation with noise and without samples, were introduced by Raman and Raman (2025) and Li, Raman, and Tewari (2024) respectively. We show the equivalence of these models for uniform and non-uniform generation, and provide a characterization of non-uniform noisy generation. The former paper asked if there is any separation between noisy and non-noisy generation in the limit -- we show that such a separation exists even with a single noisy string. Finally, we study the framework of generation with feedback, introduced by Charikar and Pabbaraju (2025), where the algorithm is strengthened by allowing it to ask membership queries. We show finite queries add no power, but infinite queries yield a strictly more powerful model.
  In summary, the results in this paper resolve the union-closedness of language generation in the limit, and leverage those techniques (and others) to give precise characterizations for natural variants that incorporate noise, loss, and feedback.

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2 outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks, including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training data to support future work on LLM safety.

<title>Efficient Visual Appearance Optimization by Learning from Prior Preferences</title>

Abstract: Adjusting visual parameters such as brightness and contrast is common in our everyday experiences. Finding the optimal parameter setting is challenging due to the large search space and the lack of an explicit objective function, leaving users to rely solely on their implicit preferences. Prior work has explored Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) to address this challenge, involving users to iteratively select preferred designs from candidate sets. However, PBO often requires many rounds of preference comparisons, making it more suitable for designers than everyday end-users. We propose Meta-PO, a novel method that integrates PBO with meta-learning to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, Meta-PO infers prior users' preferences and stores them as models, which are leveraged to intelligently suggest design candidates for the new users, enabling faster convergence and more personalized results. An experimental evaluation of our method for appearance design tasks on 2D and 3D content showed that participants achieved satisfactory appearance in 5.86 iterations using Meta-PO when participants shared similar goals with a population (e.g., tuning for a ``warm'' look) and in 8 iterations even generalizes across divergent goals (e.g., from ``vintage'', ``warm'', to ``holiday''). Meta-PO makes personalized visual optimization more applicable to end-users through a generalizable, more efficient optimization conditioned on preferences, with the potential to scale interface personalization more broadly.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However, wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data. Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was 76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection, dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1% with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG recordings.

Abstract: Object-centric predictive process monitoring explores and utilizes object-centric event logs to enhance process predictions. The main challenge lies in extracting relevant information and building effective models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model that predicts future process behavior, focusing on two tasks: next activity prediction and next event time. The proposed model employs a graph attention network to encode activities and their relationships, combined with an LSTM network to handle temporal dependencies. Evaluated on one reallife and three synthetic event logs, the model demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Multimodal News Recommendation through Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Personalized News Recommendation systems (PNR) have emerged as a solution to information overload by predicting and suggesting news items tailored to individual user interests. However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and rule-compliant behavior of autonomous agents in uncertain environments remains a fundamental challenge in modern robotics. Our work shows how neuro-symbolic systems, which integrate probabilistic, symbolic white-box reasoning models with deep learning methods, offer a powerful solution to this challenge. This enables the simultaneous consideration of explicit rules and neural models trained on noisy data, combining the strength of structured reasoning with flexible representations. To this end, we introduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep probabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in shared traffic spaces. Furthermore, we propose the concept of self-doubt, implemented as a probability density conditioned on doubt features such as travel velocity, employed sensors, or health factors. In a real-world aerial mobility study, we demonstrate CoCo's advantages for intelligent autonomous systems to learn appropriate doubts and navigate complex and uncertain environments safely and compliantly.

Abstract: Line search is a fundamental part of iterative optimization methods for unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization problems to determine suitable step lengths that provide sufficient improvement in each iteration. Traditional line search methods are based on iterative interval refinement, where valuable information about function value and gradient is discarded in each iteration. We propose a line search method via Bayesian optimization, preserving and utilizing otherwise discarded information to improve step-length choices. Our approach is guaranteed to converge and shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods based on empirical tests on the challenging unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization problems from the CUTEst test set.

Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and navigation. We propose a novel LiDAR-Visual odometry framework that integrates LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively, ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities. Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.

To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine. Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification, yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes. Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

Abstract: Large language models for code (Code LLM) are increasingly utilized in programming environments. Despite their utility, the training datasets for top LLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations. Some models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and licenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive and only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we propose an application of the "Chinese Wall" technique, inspired by the reverse engineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to generate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but ethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that, otherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation, we've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in CanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20% compared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical application of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of models trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions.

Abstract: Handling missing values is a common challenge in biostatistical analyses, typically addressed by imputation methods. We propose a novel, fast, and easy-to-use imputation method called missing value imputation with adversarial random forests (MissARF), based on generative machine learning, that provides both single and multiple imputation. MissARF employs adversarial random forest (ARF) for density estimation and data synthesis. To impute a missing value of an observation, we condition on the non-missing values and sample from the estimated conditional distribution generated by ARF. Our experiments demonstrate that MissARF performs comparably to state-of-the-art single and multiple imputation methods in terms of imputation quality and fast runtime with no additional costs for multiple imputation.

<title>CoLD: Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing for Process Reward Models</title>

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps, even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation, improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for uncertainty quantification in regression models defined in metric spaces. Leveraging a newly defined notion of homoscedasticity, we develop a conformal prediction algorithm that offers finite-sample coverage guarantees and fast convergence rates of the oracle estimator. In heteroscedastic settings, we forgo these non-asymptotic guarantees to gain statistical efficiency, proposing a local $k$--nearest--neighbor method without conformal calibration that is adaptive to the geometry of each particular nonlinear space. Both procedures work with any regression algorithm and are scalable to large data sets, allowing practitioners to plug in their preferred models and incorporate domain expertise. We prove consistency for the proposed estimators under minimal conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach in personalized--medicine applications involving random response objects such as probability distributions and graph Laplacians.

<title>Towards physician-centered oversight of conversational diagnostic AI</title>

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision. This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across 60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions. PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for enhancing real-world care.

Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis, we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models while using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.

Abstract: Parr et al., 2025 examines how auto-regressive and deep temporal models differ in their treatment of non-Markovian sequence modelling. Building on this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference. We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily bound to their underlying model architectures.

Abstract: In recent decades, hypergraphs and their analysis through Topological Data Analysis (TDA) have emerged as powerful tools for understanding complex data structures. Various methods have been developed to construct hypergraphs -- referred to as simplicial complexes in the TDA framework -- over datasets, enabling the formation of edges between more than two vertices. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing hypergraphs from collections of multivariate time series. While prior work has focused on the case of a single multivariate time series, we extend this framework to handle collections of such time series. Our approach generalizes the method proposed in Chretien and al. by leveraging the properties of signature transforms to introduce controlled randomness, thereby enhancing the robustness of the construction process. We validate our method on synthetic datasets and present promising results.

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Abstract: We present the LLM Economist, a novel framework that uses agent-based modeling to design and assess economic policies in strategic environments with hierarchical decision-making. At the lower level, bounded rational worker agents -- instantiated as persona-conditioned prompts sampled from U.S. Census-calibrated income and demographic statistics -- choose labor supply to maximize text-based utility functions learned in-context. At the upper level, a planner agent employs in-context reinforcement learning to propose piecewise-linear marginal tax schedules anchored to the current U.S. federal brackets. This construction endows economic simulacra with three capabilities requisite for credible fiscal experimentation: (i) optimization of heterogeneous utilities, (ii) principled generation of large, demographically realistic agent populations, and (iii) mechanism design -- the ultimate nudging problem -- expressed entirely in natural language. Experiments with populations of up to one hundred interacting agents show that the planner converges near Stackelberg equilibria that improve aggregate social welfare relative to Saez solutions, while a periodic, persona-level voting procedure furthers these gains under decentralized governance. These results demonstrate that large language model-based agents can jointly model, simulate, and govern complex economic systems, providing a tractable test bed for policy evaluation at the societal scale to help build better civilizations.

Abstract: This paper presents adaptive conformal selection (ACS), an interactive framework for model-free selection with guaranteed error control. Building on conformal selection (Jin and Cand\`es, 2023b), ACS generalizes the approach to support human-in-the-loop adaptive data analysis. Under the ACS framework, we can partially reuse the data to boost the selection power, make decisions on the fly while exploring the data, and incorporate new information or preferences as they arise. The key to ACS is a carefully designed principle that controls the information available for decision making, allowing the data analyst to explore the data adaptively while maintaining rigorous control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Based on the ACS framework, we provide concrete selection algorithms for various goals, including model update/selection, diversified selection, and incorporating newly available labeled data. The effectiveness of ACS is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations and real-data applications in large language model (LLM) deployment and drug discovery.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces offer a compelling approach for music recommendation, enabling users to express complex preferences conversationally. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in this direction, their scalability in recommender systems is limited by high costs and latency. Retrieval-based approaches using smaller language models mitigate these issues but often rely on single-modal item representations, overlook long-term user preferences, and require full model retraining, posing challenges for real-world deployment. In this paper, we present JAM (Just Ask for Music), a lightweight and intuitive framework for natural language music recommendation. JAM models user-query-item interactions as vector translations in a shared latent space, inspired by knowledge graph embedding methods like TransE. To capture the complexity of music and user intent, JAM aggregates multimodal item features via cross-attention and sparse mixture-of-experts. We also introduce JAMSessions, a new dataset of over 100k user-query-item triples with anonymized user/item embeddings, uniquely combining conversational queries and user long-term preferences. Our results show that JAM provides accurate recommendations, produces intuitive representations suitable for practical use cases, and can be easily integrated with existing music recommendation stacks.

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to 6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression can flexibly represent the posterior distribution of an interest parameter given sufficient information on the likelihood. However, in some cases, we have little knowledge regarding the probability model. For example, when investing in a financial instrument, the probability model of cash flow is generally unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the likelihood-free Gaussian process (LFGP), which allows representation of the posterior distributions of interest parameters for scalable problems without directly setting their likelihood functions. The LFGP establishes clusters in which the value of the interest parameter can be considered approximately identical, and it approximates the likelihood of the interest parameter in each cluster to a Gaussian using the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. We expect that the proposed framework will contribute significantly to likelihood-free modeling, particularly by reducing the assumptions for the probability model and the computational costs for scalable problems.

The main results are based on a novel characterization of $\epsilon$-approximate local minimum for nonsmooth functions, and recent developments on perturbed gradient methods for escaping saddle points for smooth problems. Specifically, we show that under standard assumptions, the perturbed proximal point, perturbed proximal gradient and perturbed proximal linear algorithms find $\epsilon$-approximate local minimum for nonsmooth weakly convex functions in $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log(d)^4)$ iterations, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem.

Abstract: In today's day and age, a mobile phone has become a basic requirement needed for anyone to thrive. With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.

In this paper, we extend this, ostensibly surprising, message to batch multiclass learning, online boolean learning, and online multiclass learning. For our online learning results, we first consider an adaptive adversary variant of the classical model of Dawid and Tewari (2022). Then, we introduce the first (to the best of our knowledge) model of online learning with quantum examples.

Abstract: In data-driven optimization, the sample performance of the obtained decision typically incurs an optimistic bias against the true performance, a phenomenon commonly known as the Optimizer's Curse and intimately related to overfitting in machine learning. Common techniques to correct this bias, such as cross-validation, require repeatedly solving additional optimization problems and are therefore computationally expensive. We develop a general bias correction approach, building on what we call Optimizer's Information Criterion (OIC), that directly approximates the first-order bias and does not require solving any additional optimization problems. Our OIC generalizes the celebrated Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate the objective performance in data-driven optimization, which crucially involves not only model fitting but also its interplay with the downstream optimization. As such it can be used for decision selection instead of only model selection. We apply our approach to a range of data-driven optimization formulations comprising empirical and parametric models, their regularized counterparts, and furthermore contextual optimization. Finally, we provide numerical validation on the superior performance of our approach under synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that presents supervisory signals to real-world problems, bypassing the extensive cost of manual labeling. Consequently, self-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) has seen a recent surge of interest, since SSL is especially attractive for unsupervised tasks. However, recent works have reported that the choice of a data augmentation function has significant impact on the accuracy of SSAD, posing augmentation search as an essential but nontrivial problem due to lack of labeled validation data. In this paper, we introduce ST-SSAD, the first unsupervised approach to end-to-end augmentation tuning for SSAD. To this end, our work presents two key contributions. The first is a new unsupervised validation loss that quantifies the alignment between augmented training data and unlabeled validation data. The second is new differentiable augmentation functions, allowing data augmentation hyperparameter(s) to be tuned in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two testbeds with semantic class anomalies and subtle industrial defects show that ST-SSAD gives significant performance gains over existing works. All our code and testbeds are available at https://github.com/jaeminyoo/ST-SSAD.

Abstract: Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis poses a key challenge in biopharmaceuticals, aiding chemists in finding appropriate reactant molecules for given product molecules. With reactants and products represented as 2D graphs, retrosynthesis constitutes a conditional graph-to-graph (G2G) generative task. Inspired by advancements in discrete diffusion models for graph generation, we aim to design a diffusion-based method to address this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based G2G framework while retaining essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our key innovation involves a multi-stage diffusion process. We decompose the retrosynthesis procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products, then generate external bonds to connect products and generated groups. Interestingly, this generation process mirrors the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template retrosynthesis workflow, \emph{i.e.} from reaction center identification to synthon completion. Based on these designs, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel diffusion-based method for the retrosynthesis task. Experimental results demonstrate that RetroDiff surpasses all semi-template methods in accuracy, and outperforms template-based and template-free methods in large-scale scenarios and molecular validity, respectively.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from large models to small models and has recently achieved remarkable success. However, the reliability of existing KD methods in real-world applications, especially under distribution shift, remains underexplored. Distribution shift refers to the data distribution drifts between the training and testing phases, and this can adversely affect the efficacy of KD. In this paper, we propose a unified and systematic framework \textsc{ShiftKD} to benchmark KD against two general distributional shifts: diversity and correlation shift. The evaluation benchmark covers more than 30 methods from algorithmic, data-driven, and optimization perspectives for five benchmark datasets. Our development of \textsc{ShiftKD} conducts extensive experiments and reveals strengths and limitations of current SOTA KD methods. More importantly, we thoroughly analyze key factors in student model training process, including data augmentation, pruning methods, optimizers, and evaluation metrics. We believe \textsc{ShiftKD} could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing KD in real-world scenarios, thus driving the development of more robust KD methods in response to evolving demands. The code will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: This paper addresses intervention-based causal representation learning (CRL) under a general nonparametric latent causal model and an unknown transformation that maps the latent variables to the observed variables. Linear and general transformations are investigated. The paper addresses both the identifiability and achievability aspects. Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure the recovery of the true latent causal variables and the underlying latent causal graph. Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees. By drawing novel connections between score functions (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a score-based class of algorithms that ensures both identifiability and achievability. First, the paper focuses on linear transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability. It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to mixing with parents for general causal models and perfect recovery of the latent graph for sufficiently nonlinear causal models. Secondly, it focuses on general transformations and demonstrates that two stochastic hard interventions per node are sufficient for identifiability. This is achieved by defining a differentiable loss function whose global optima ensure identifiability for general CRL. Notably, one does not need to know which pair of interventional environments has the same node intervened. Finally, the theoretical results are empirically validated via experiments on structured synthetic data and image data.

Abstract: Attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a variety of disciplines including natural languages. To deepen our understanding of their sequential modeling capabilities, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study them. A key finding is that when trained on first-order Markov chains, transformers with two or more layers consistently develop an induction head mechanism to estimate the in-context bigram conditional distribution. In contrast, single-layer transformers, unable to form an induction head, directly learn the Markov kernel but often face a surprising challenge: they become trapped in local minima representing the unigram distribution, whereas deeper models reliably converge to the ground-truth bigram. While single-layer transformers can theoretically model first-order Markov chains, their empirical failure to learn this simple kernel in practice remains a curious phenomenon. To explain this contrasting behavior of single-layer models, in this paper we introduce a new framework for a principled analysis of transformers via Markov chains. Leveraging our framework, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima (bigram) and bad local minima (unigram) contingent on data properties and model architecture. We precisely delineate the regimes under which these local optima occur. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena. Code is available at https://github.com/Bond1995/Markov .

Abstract: The Indian summer monsoon is a highly complex and critical weather system that directly affects the livelihoods of over a billion people across the Indian subcontinent. Accurate short-term forecasting remains a major scientific challenge due to the monsoon's intrinsic nonlinearity and its sensitivity to multi-scale drivers, including local land-atmosphere interactions and large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena. In this study, we address the problem of forecasting daily rainfall across India during the summer months, focusing on both one-day and three-day lead times. We use Autoformers - deep learning transformer-based architectures designed for time series forecasting. These are trained on historical gridded precipitation data from the Indian Meteorological Department (1901--2023) at spatial resolutions of $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$, as well as $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$. The models also incorporate auxiliary meteorological variables from ECMWFs reanalysis datasets, namely, cloud cover, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, vorticity, and wind speed. Forecasts at $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$ are benchmarked against ECMWFs High-Resolution Ensemble System (HRES), widely regarded as the most accurate numerical weather predictor, and at $1^\circ \times 1^\circ $ with those from National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). We conduct both nationwide evaluations and localized analyses for major Indian cities. Our results indicate that transformer-based deep learning models consistently outperform both HRES and NCEP, as well as other climatological baselines. Specifically, compared to our model, forecasts from HRES and NCEP model have about 22\% and 43\% higher error, respectively, for a single day prediction, and over 27\% and 66\% higher error respectively, for a three day prediction.

<title>Understanding the training of infinitely deep and wide ResNets with Conditional Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient flow for the training of deep neural networks. If Residual Neural Networks are a popular example of very deep architectures, their training constitutes a challenging optimization problem due notably to the non-convexity and the non-coercivity of the objective. Yet, in applications, those tasks are successfully solved by simple optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. To better understand this phenomenon, we focus here on a ``mean-field'' model of infinitely deep and arbitrarily wide ResNet, parameterized by probability measures over the product set of layers and parameters and with constant marginal on the set of layers. Indeed, in the case of shallow neural networks, mean field models have proven to benefit from simplified loss-landscapes and good theoretical guarantees when trained with gradient flow for the Wasserstein metric on the set of probability measures. Motivated by this approach, we propose to train our model with gradient flow w.r.t. the conditional Optimal Transport distance: a restriction of the classical Wasserstein distance which enforces our marginal condition. Relying on the theory of gradient flows in metric spaces we first show the well-posedness of the gradient flow equation and its consistency with the training of ResNets at finite width. Performing a local Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz analysis, we then show convergence of the gradient flow for well-chosen initializations: if the number of features is finite but sufficiently large and the risk is sufficiently small at initialization, the gradient flow converges towards a global minimizer. This is the first result of this type for infinitely deep and arbitrarily wide ResNets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a structure-guided Gauss-Newton (SgGN) method for solving least squares problems using a shallow ReLU neural network. The method effectively takes advantage of both the least squares structure and the neural network structure of the objective function. By categorizing the weights and biases of the hidden and output layers of the network as nonlinear and linear parameters, respectively, the method iterates back and forth between the nonlinear and linear parameters. The nonlinear parameters are updated by a damped Gauss-Newton method and the linear ones are updated by a linear solver. Moreover, at the Gauss-Newton step, a special form of the Gauss-Newton matrix is derived for the shallow ReLU neural network and is used for efficient iterations. It is shown that the corresponding mass and Gauss-Newton matrices in the respective linear and nonlinear steps are symmetric and positive definite under reasonable assumptions. Thus, the SgGN method naturally produces an effective search direction without the need of additional techniques like shifting in the Levenberg-Marquardt method to achieve invertibility of the Gauss-Newton matrix. The convergence and accuracy of the method are demonstrated numerically for several challenging function approximation problems, especially those with discontinuities or sharp transition layers that pose significant challenges for commonly used training algorithms in machine learning.

Abstract: We study the generalized linear contextual bandit problem within the constraints of limited adaptivity. In this paper, we present two algorithms, $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$ and $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$, that address, respectively, two prevalent limited adaptivity settings. Given a budget $M$ on the number of policy updates, in the first setting, the algorithm needs to decide upfront $M$ rounds at which it will update its policy, while in the second setting it can adaptively perform $M$ policy updates during its course. For the first setting, we design an algorithm $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$, that incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when $M = \Omega( \log{\log T} )$ and the arm feature vectors are generated stochastically. For the second setting, we design an algorithm $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$ that updates its policy $\tilde{O}(\log^2 T)$ times and achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ even when the arm feature vectors are adversarially generated. Notably, in these bounds, we manage to eliminate the dependence on a key instance dependent parameter $\kappa$, that captures non-linearity of the underlying reward model. Our novel approach for removing this dependence for generalized linear contextual bandits might be of independent interest.

<title>Oversmoothing Alleviation in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey and Unified View</title>

Abstract: Oversmoothing is a common challenge in learning graph neural networks (GNN), where, as layers increase, embedding features learned from GNNs quickly become similar or indistinguishable, making them incapable of differentiating network proximity. A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial for harnessing deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare the difference between different approaches in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first propose a taxonomy for GNN oversmoothing alleviation which includes three themes to tackle oversmoothing. After that, we separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to ATNPA, and discussion of their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws an in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field but also shows a clear road map for future study.

Machine learning methods like genetic algorithms have shown promise in this domain, but are hindered by significant computational time and the complexity of their derived solutions. This paper introduces SSDE (Symbolic Solver for Differential Equations), a novel reinforcement learning-based approach that derives symbolic closed-form solutions for various differential equations. Evaluations across a diverse set of ordinary and partial differential equations demonstrate that SSDE outperforms existing machine learning methods, delivering superior accuracy and efficiency in obtaining analytical solutions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) with experience replay, experiences stored in a replay buffer influence the RL agent's performance. Information about how these experiences influence the agent's performance is valuable for various purposes, such as identifying experiences that negatively influence underperforming agents. One method for estimating the influence of experiences is the leave-one-out (LOO) method. However, this method is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we present Policy Iteration with Turn-over Dropout (PIToD), which efficiently estimates the influence of experiences. We evaluate how correctly PIToD estimates the influence of experiences and its efficiency compared to LOO. We then apply PIToD to amend underperforming RL agents, i.e., we use PIToD to estimate negatively influential experiences for the RL agents and to delete the influence of these experiences. We show that RL agents' performance is significantly improved via amendments with PIToD.

Abstract: Convergence rate analysis for general state-space Markov chains is fundamentally important in areas such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and algorithmic analysis (for computing explicit convergence bounds). This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in Qu, Blanchet and Glynn (2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.

Abstract: Deep learning models benefit from rich (e.g., multi-modal) input features. However, multimodal models might be challenging to deploy, because some inputs may be missing at inference. Current popular solutions include marginalization, imputation, and training multiple models. Marginalization achieves calibrated predictions, but it is computationally expensive and only feasible for low dimensional inputs. Imputation may result in inaccurate predictions, particularly when high-dimensional data, such as images, are missing. Training multiple models, where each model is designed to handle different subsets of inputs, can work well but requires prior knowledge of missing input patterns. Furthermore, training and retaining multiple models can be costly. We propose an efficient method to learn both the conditional distribution using full inputs and the marginal distributions. Our method, Knockout, randomly replaces input features with appropriate placeholder values during training. We provide a theoretical justification for Knockout and show that it can be interpreted as an implicit marginalization strategy. We evaluate Knockout across a wide range of simulations and real-world datasets and show that it offers strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require machine-learning models to be able to deal with non-stationary data distributions and thus learn autonomously over an extended period of time, often in an online setting. One of the main challenges in this scenario is the so-called catastrophic forgetting (CF) for which the learning model tends to focus on the most recent tasks while experiencing predictive degradation on older ones. In the online setting, the most effective solutions employ a fixed-size memory buffer to store old samples used for replay when training on new tasks. Many approaches have been presented to tackle this problem. However, it is not clear how predictive uncertainty information for memory management can be leveraged in the most effective manner and conflicting strategies are proposed to populate the memory. Are the easiest-to-forget or the easiest-to-remember samples more effective in combating CF? Starting from the intuition that predictive uncertainty provides an idea of the samples' location in the decision space, this work presents an in-depth analysis of different uncertainty estimates and strategies for populating the memory. The investigation provides a better understanding of the characteristics data points should have for alleviating CF. Then, we propose an alternative method for estimating predictive uncertainty via the generalised variance induced by the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of predictive uncertainty measures helps in reducing CF in different settings.

Abstract: The field of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) systems is growing rapidly. Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, a unifying framework is needed to organize common NeSy modeling patterns and develop general learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative NeSy modeling. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we introduce a suite of four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we ground the NeSy-EBM framework with Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating the real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.

Abstract: Data assimilation has become a key technique for combining physical models with observational data to estimate state variables. However, classical assimilation algorithms often struggle with the high nonlinearity present in both physical and observational models. To address this challenge, a novel generative model, termed the State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is proposed for data-driven assimilation. The marginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to match the true posterior distribution under mild assumptions, suggesting its theoretical advantages over previous score-based approaches. Experimental results also indicate that SOAD may offer improved performance compared to existing data-driven methods.

Abstract: High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve the meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experiences into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well fitted to meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds, and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search costs against baselines.

Abstract: This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.

Abstract: On-device computing, or edge computing, is becoming increasingly important for remote sensing, particularly in applications like deep network-based perception on on-orbit satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these scenarios, two brain-like capabilities are crucial for remote sensing models: (1) high energy efficiency, allowing the model to operate on edge devices with limited computing resources, and (2) online adaptation, enabling the model to quickly adapt to environmental variations, weather changes, and sensor drift. This work addresses these needs by proposing an online adaptation framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for remote sensing. Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning. Besides, we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps. Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches under varying weather conditions. The proposed method enables energy-efficient and fast online adaptation on edge devices, and has much potential in applications such as remote perception on on-orbit satellites and UAV.

Despite this reduction, the massive number of experts in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. In this paper, we study how to address this, by pruning MoEs. Among pruning methodologies, unstructured pruning has been known to achieve the highest performance for a given pruning ratio, compared to structured pruning, since the latter imposes constraints on the sparsification structure. This is intuitive, as the solution space of unstructured pruning subsumes that of structured pruning. However, our counterintuitive finding reveals that expert pruning, a form of structured pruning, can actually precede unstructured pruning to outperform unstructured-only pruning. As existing expert pruning, requiring $O(\frac{k^n}{\sqrt{n}})$ forward passes for $n$ experts, cannot scale for recent MoEs, we propose a scalable alternative with $O(1)$ complexity, yet outperforming the more expensive methods. The key idea is leveraging a latent structure between experts, based on behavior similarity, such that the greedy decision of whether to prune closely captures the joint pruning effect. Ours is highly effective -- for Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art unstructured pruning fails to. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We analyze a distributed algorithm to compute a low-rank matrix factorization on $N$ clients, each holding a local dataset $\mathbf{S}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d}$, mathematically, we seek to solve $min_{\mathbf{U}^i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i\times r}, \mathbf{V}\in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} } \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathbf{S}^i - \mathbf{U}^i \mathbf{V}^\top\|^2_{\text{F}}$. Considering a power initialization of $\mathbf{V}$, we rewrite the previous smooth non-convex problem into a smooth strongly-convex problem that we solve using a parallel Nesterov gradient descent potentially requiring a single step of communication at the initialization step. For any client $i$ in $\{1, \dots, N\}$, we obtain a global $\mathbf{V}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ common to all clients and a local variable $\mathbf{U}^i$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n_i \times r}$. We provide a linear rate of convergence of the excess loss which depends on $\sigma_{\max} / \sigma_{r}$, where $\sigma_{r}$ is the $r^{\mathrm{th}}$ singular value of the concatenation $\mathbf{S}$ of the matrices $(\mathbf{S}^i)_{i=1}^N$. This result improves the rates of convergence given in the literature, which depend on $\sigma_{\max}^2 / \sigma_{\min}^2$. We provide an upper bound on the Frobenius-norm error of reconstruction under the power initialization strategy. We complete our analysis with experiments on both synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models (DMs) have garnered widespread attention for their impressive advancements in image generation. However, their growing popularity has raised ethical and social concerns related to key non-functional properties of trustworthiness, such as robustness, fairness, security, privacy, factuality, and explainability, similar to those in traditional deep learning (DL) tasks. Conventional approaches for studying trustworthiness in DL tasks often fall short due to the unique characteristics of T2I DMs, e.g., the multi-modal nature. Given the challenge, recent efforts have been made to develop new methods for investigating trustworthiness in T2I DMs via various means, including falsification, enhancement, verification \& validation and assessment. However, there is a notable lack of in-depth analysis concerning those non-functional properties and means. In this survey, we provide a timely and focused review of the literature on trustworthy T2I DMs, covering a concise-structured taxonomy from the perspectives of property, means, benchmarks and applications. Our review begins with an introduction to essential preliminaries of T2I DMs, and then we summarise key definitions/metrics specific to T2I tasks and analyses the means proposed in recent literature based on these definitions/metrics. Additionally, we review benchmarks and domain applications of T2I DMs. Finally, we highlight the gaps in current research, discuss the limitations of existing methods, and propose future research directions to advance the development of trustworthy T2I DMs. Furthermore, we keep up-to-date updates in this field to track the latest developments and maintain our GitHub repository at: https://github.com/wellzline/Trustworthy_T2I_DMs

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions is crucial for their utility, honesty, and safety. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it faces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability. Recent methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) have proposed offline alternatives to RLHF, simplifying the process by reparameterizing the reward function. However, DPO depends on a potentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed target reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings. In this work, we propose $\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization algorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward margin. Specifically, $\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution, balancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized reward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\alpha$-DPO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its ability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control. Empirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\alpha$-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings, establishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves significant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Continual learning requires to overcome catastrophic forgetting when training a single model on a sequence of tasks. Recent top-performing approaches are prompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts) to encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the fixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task. However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task loss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate adaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task. Previous efforts have tried to address this by directly generating prompts from input queries instead of selecting from a set of candidates. However, these prompts are continuous, which lack sufficient abstraction for task knowledge representation, making them less effective for continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method that incorporates Vector Quantization (VQ) into end-to-end training of a set of discrete prompts. In this way, VQ-Prompt can optimize the prompt selection process with task loss and meanwhile achieve effective abstraction of task knowledge for continual learning. Extensive experiments show that VQ-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods across a variety of benchmarks under the challenging class-incremental setting. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/jiaolifengmi/VQ-Prompt}{this https URL}.

<title>Constrained Optimal Fuel Consumption of HEVs under Observational Noise</title>

Abstract: In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint, assuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world scenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference speeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these imperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly incorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a robust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and employ a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using both the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC constraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel consumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly encountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC) applications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.

Abstract: When explaining black-box machine learning models, it's often important for explanations to have certain desirable properties. Most existing methods `encourage' desirable properties in their construction of explanations. In this work, we demonstrate that these forms of encouragement do not consistently create explanations with the properties that are supposedly being targeted. Moreover, they do not allow for any control over which properties are prioritized when different properties are at odds with each other. We propose to directly optimize explanations for desired properties. Our direct approach not only produces explanations with optimal properties more consistently but also empowers users to control trade-offs between different properties, allowing them to create explanations with exactly what is needed for a particular task.

Our model is used to reconstruct high-resolution tsunami wavefields from extremely sparse observations, including cases where the tsunami epicenters are not represented in the training set. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the Linear Interpolation with Huygens-Fresnel Principle in generating dense observation networks, achieving markedly improved accuracy.

Abstract: Ordinal Classification (OC) addresses those classification tasks where the labels exhibit a natural order. Unlike nominal classification, which treats all classes as mutually exclusive and unordered, OC takes the ordinal relationship into account, producing more accurate and relevant results. This is particularly critical in applications where the magnitude of classification errors has significant consequences. Despite this, OC problems are often tackled using nominal methods, leading to suboptimal solutions. Although decision trees are among the most popular classification approaches, ordinal tree-based approaches have received less attention when compared to other classifiers. This work provides a comprehensive survey of ordinal splitting criteria, standardising the notations used in the literature to enhance clarity and consistency. Three ordinal splitting criteria, Ordinal Gini (OGini), Weighted Information Gain (WIG), and Ranking Impurity (RI), are compared to the nominal counterparts of the first two (Gini and information gain), by incorporating them into a decision tree classifier. An extensive repository considering $45$ publicly available OC datasets is presented, supporting the first experimental comparison of ordinal and nominal splitting criteria using well-known OC evaluation metrics. The results have been statistically analysed, highlighting that OGini stands out as the best ordinal splitting criterion to date, reducing the mean absolute error achieved by Gini by more than 3.02%. To promote reproducibility, all source code developed, a detailed guide for reproducing the results, the 45 OC datasets, and the individual results for all the evaluated methodologies are provided.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, yet they still face significant challenges in reasoning and arithmetic. Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area. Our dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/duyguislakoglu/chronosense.

Abstract: Handling incomplete and heterogeneous data remains a central challenge in real-world machine learning, where missing values may follow complex mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and features can be of mixed types (numerical and categorical). Existing methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or privacy risks, or fail to jointly address data heterogeneity and structured missingness. We propose the \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{P}robability \textbf{M}ass \textbf{K}ernel (\textbf{HI-PMK}), a novel data-dependent representation learning approach that eliminates the need for imputation. HI-PMK introduces two key innovations: (1) a probability mass-based dissimilarity measure that adapts to local data distributions across heterogeneous features (numerical, ordinal, nominal), and (2) a missingness-aware uncertainty strategy (MaxU) that conservatively handles all three missingness mechanisms by assigning maximal plausible dissimilarity to unobserved entries. Our approach is privacy-preserving, scalable, and readily applicable to downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. Extensive experiments on over 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HI-PMK consistently outperforms traditional imputation-based pipelines and kernel methods across a wide range of missing data settings.

Abstract: Building mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture for Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is emerging as a potential direction in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for its modular design and remarkable performance. However, simply stacking the number of experts cannot guarantee significant improvement. In this work, we first conduct qualitative analysis to indicate that experts collapse to similar representations in vanilla MoE, limiting the capacity of modular design and computational efficiency. Ulteriorly, Our analysis reveals that the performance of previous MoE variants maybe limited by a lack of diversity among experts. Motivated by these findings, we propose Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE), a resource-efficient MoE variant that trains experts in an orthogonal manner to promote diversity. In OMoE, a Gram-Schmidt process is leveraged to enforce that the experts' representations lie within the Stiefel manifold. By applying orthogonal constraints directly to the architecture, OMoE keeps the learning objective unchanged, without compromising optimality. Our method is simple and alleviates memory bottlenecks, as it incurs minimal experts compared to vanilla MoE models. Experiments on diverse commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that OMoE can consistently achieve stable and efficient performance improvement when compared with the state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of required experts.

Abstract: Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.

Abstract: Character diversity in competitive games, while enriching gameplay, often introduces balance challenges that can negatively impact player experience and strategic depth. Traditional balance assessments rely on aggregate metrics like win rates and pick rates, which offer limited insight into the intricate dynamics of team-based games and nuanced character roles. This paper proposes a novel clustering-based methodology to analyze character balance, leveraging in-game data from Valorant to account for team composition influences and reveal latent character roles. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering with Jensen-Shannon Divergence to professional match data from the Valorant Champions Tour 2022, our approach identifies distinct clusters of agents exhibiting similar co-occurrence patterns within team compositions. This method not only complements existing quantitative metrics but also provides a more holistic and interpretable perspective on character synergies and potential imbalances, offering game developers a valuable tool for informed and context-aware balance adjustments.

Abstract: The problem of learning single index and multi index models has gained significant interest as a fundamental task in high-dimensional statistics. Many recent works have analysed gradient-based methods, particularly in the setting of isotropic data distributions, often in the context of neural network training. Such studies have uncovered precise characterisations of algorithmic sample complexity in terms of certain analytic properties of the target function, such as the leap, information, and generative exponents. These properties establish a quantitative separation between low and high complexity learning tasks. In this work, we show that high complexity cases are rare. Specifically, we prove that introducing a small random perturbation to the data distribution--via a random shift in the first moment--renders any Gaussian single index model as easy to learn as a linear function. We further extend this result to a class of multi index models, namely sparse Boolean functions, also known as Juntas.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized densities presents a fundamental challenge with wide-ranging applications, from posterior inference to molecular dynamics simulations. Continuous flow-based neural samplers offer a promising approach, learning a velocity field that satisfies key principles of marginal density evolution (e.g., the continuity equation) to generate samples. However, this learning procedure requires accurate estimation of intractable terms linked to the computationally challenging partition function, for which existing estimators often suffer from high variance or low accuracy. To overcome this, we introduce an improved estimator for these challenging quantities, employing a velocity-driven Sequential Monte Carlo method enhanced with control variates. Furthermore, we introduce a shortcut consistency model to boost the runtime efficiency of the flow-based neural sampler by minimizing its required sampling steps. Our proposed Neural Flow Shortcut Sampler empirically outperforms existing flow-based neural samplers on both synthetic datasets and complex n-body system targets.

Abstract: In the past decade, motivated by the putative failure of naive self-play deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in adversarial imperfect-information games, researchers have developed numerous DRL algorithms based on fictitious play (FP), double oracle (DO), and counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). In light of recent results of the magnetic mirror descent algorithm, we hypothesize that simpler generic policy gradient methods like PPO are competitive with or superior to these FP-, DO-, and CFR-based DRL approaches. To facilitate the resolution of this hypothesis, we implement and release the first broadly accessible exact exploitability computations for four large games. Using these games, we conduct the largest-ever exploitability comparison of DRL algorithms for imperfect-information games. Over 5600 training runs, we find that FP-, DO-, and CFR-based approaches fail to outperform generic policy gradient methods.

Abstract: System identification is normally involved in augmenting time series data by time shifting and nonlinearisation (e.g., polynomial basis), both of which introduce redundancy in features and samples. Many research works focus on reducing redundancy feature-wise, while less attention is paid to sample-wise redundancy. This paper proposes a novel data pruning method, called mini-batch FastCan, to reduce sample-wise redundancy based on dictionary learning. Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets. The R-squared between the coefficients of models trained on the full datasets and the coefficients of models trained on pruned datasets is adopted to evaluate the performance of data pruning methods. It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the random pruning method.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to learning fair machine learning models often require rebuilding models from scratch, typically without considering potentially existing models. In a context where models need to be retrained frequently, this can lead to inconsistent model updates, as well as redundant and costly validation testing. To address this limitation, we introduce the notion of controlled model debiasing, a novel supervised learning task relying on two desiderata: that the differences between the new fair model and the existing one should be (i) minimal and (ii) interpretable. After providing theoretical guarantees to this new problem, we introduce a novel algorithm for algorithmic fairness, COMMOD, that is both model-agnostic and does not require the sensitive attribute at test time. In addition, our algorithm is explicitly designed to enforce minimal and interpretable changes between biased and debiased predictions in a binary classification task, a property that, while highly desirable in high-stakes applications, is rarely prioritized as an explicit objective in fairness literature. Our approach combines a concept-based architecture and adversarial learning and we demonstrate through empirical results that it achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art debiasing methods while performing minimal and interpretable prediction changes.

Abstract: Brain foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in computational neuroscience, offering a revolutionary framework for processing diverse neural signals across different brain-related tasks. These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications.

Abstract: Can transformers learn to perform algorithmic tasks reliably across previously unseen input/output domains? While pre-trained language models show solid accuracy on benchmarks incorporating algorithmic reasoning, assessing the reliability of these results necessitates an ability to distinguish genuine algorithmic understanding from memorization. In this paper, we propose AttentionSpan, an algorithmic benchmark comprising five tasks of infinite input domains where we can disentangle and trace the correct, robust algorithm necessary for the task. This allows us to assess (i) models' ability to extrapolate to unseen types of inputs, including new lengths, value ranges or input domains, but also (ii)to assess the robustness of their learned mechanisms. By analyzing attention maps and performing targeted interventions, we show that attention mechanism directly causes failures in extrapolation. We make the implementation of all our tasks and interpretability methods publicly available at https://github.com/michalspiegel/AttentionSpan .

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.

Abstract: This paper describes the development of the Four Model Tree Ensemble (FMTE). The FMTE is a composite of machine learning models trained on experimental binding energies from the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME) 2012. The FMTE predicts binding energy values for all nuclei with N > 7 and Z > 7 from AME 2020 with a standard deviation of 76 keV and a mean average deviation of 34 keV. The FMTE model was developed by combining three new models with one prior model. The new models presented here have been trained on binding energy residuals from mass models using four machine learning approaches. The models presented in this work leverage shape parameters along with other physical features. We have determined the preferred machine learning approach for binding energy residuals is the least-squares boosted ensemble of trees. This approach appears to have a superior ability to both interpolate and extrapolate binding energy residuals. A comparison with the masses of isotopes that were not measured previously and a discussion of extrapolations approaching the neutron drip line have been included.

Abstract: We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images, from which we extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Diffusion-RLHF/RPO.

Abstract: A vast amount of instruction tuning data is crucial for the impressive performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but the associated computational costs and data collection demands during supervised fine-tuning make it impractical for most researchers. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to leverage all distributed data and training resources to reduce the overhead of joint training. However, most existing methods assume a fixed number of tasks, while in real-world scenarios, clients continuously encounter new knowledge and often struggle to retain old tasks due to memory constraints. In this work, we introduce the Federated Continual Instruction Tuning (FCIT) benchmark to model this real-world challenge. Our benchmark includes two realistic scenarios, encompassing four different settings and twelve carefully curated instruction tuning datasets. To address the challenges posed by FCIT, we propose dynamic knowledge organization to effectively integrate updates from different tasks during training and subspace selective activation to allocate task-specific output during inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances model performance across varying levels of data heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting. Code and dataset are released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/FCIT.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling decisions from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI-driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in stochastic optimal control. It extends the continuous-space, continuous-time Path Integral Diffusion sampling technique of [Behjoo, Chertkov 2025] to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network (GFN) framework of [Bengio, et al 2021]. In its most basic form an explicit formulation that does not require Neural Networks (NNs), DF leverages the linear solvability of the underlying MDP [Todorov, 2007] to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse-time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model -- compare DF to Metropolis-Hastings to quantify its efficiency, discuss potential NN-based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.

Abstract: Path loss modeling is a widely used technique for estimating point-to-point losses along a communications link from transmitter (Tx) to receiver (Rx). Accurate path loss predictions can optimize use of the radio frequency spectrum and minimize unwanted interference. Modern path loss modeling often leverages data-driven approaches, using machine learning to train models on drive test measurement datasets. Drive tests primarily represent downlink scenarios, where the Tx is located on a building and the Rx is located on a moving vehicle. Consequently, trained models are frequently reserved for downlink coverage estimation, lacking representation of uplink scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that data augmentation can be used to train a path loss model that is generalized to uplink, downlink, and backhaul scenarios, training using only downlink drive test measurements. By adding a small number of synthetic samples representing uplink scenarios to the training set, root mean squared error is reduced by > 8 dB on uplink examples in the test set.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by structuring predictions around human-understandable concepts. However, unintended information leakage, where predictive signals bypass the concept bottleneck, compromises their transparency. This paper introduces an information-theoretic measure to quantify leakage in CBMs, capturing the extent to which concept embeddings encode additional, unintended information beyond the specified concepts. We validate the measure through controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting leakage trends across various configurations. Our findings highlight that feature and concept dimensionality significantly influence leakage, and that classifier choice impacts measurement stability, with XGBoost emerging as the most reliable estimator. Additionally, preliminary investigations indicate that the measure exhibits the anticipated behavior when applied to soft joint CBMs, suggesting its reliability in leakage quantification beyond fully synthetic settings. While this study rigorously evaluates the measure in controlled synthetic experiments, future work can extend its application to real-world datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver outstanding performance, but their complexity often prohibits deployment in resource-constrained settings. Comprehensive structured pruning frameworks based on parameter dependency analysis reduce model size with specific regard to computational performance. When applying them to Multi-Component Neural Architectures (MCNAs), they risk network integrity by removing large parameter groups. We introduce a component-aware pruning strategy, extending dependency graphs to isolate individual components and inter-component flows. This creates smaller, targeted pruning groups that conserve functional integrity. Demonstrated effectively on a control task, our approach achieves greater sparsity and reduced performance degradation, opening a path for optimizing complex, multi-component DNNs efficiently.

Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient methods for the training of mean-field single-hidden-layer neural networks with square loss. For this high-dimensional and non-convex optimization problem, most known convergence results are either qualitative or rely on a neural tangent kernel analysis where nonlinear representations of the data are fixed. Using that this problem belongs to the class of separable nonlinear least squares problems, we consider here a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the learning problem to the training of nonlinear features. In a teacher-student scenario, we show such a strategy enables provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution. Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted ultra-fast diffusion equation. Recent results on the asymptotic behavior of such PDEs then give quantitative guarantees for the convergence of the learned feature distribution.

Abstract: When optimising for conditional value at risk (CVaR) using policy gradients (PG), current methods rely on discarding a large proportion of trajectories, resulting in poor sample efficiency. We propose a reformulation of the CVaR optimisation problem by capping the total return of trajectories used in training, rather than simply discarding them, and show that this is equivalent to the original problem if the cap is set appropriately. We show, with empirical results in an number of environments, that this reformulation of the problem results in consistently improved performance compared to baselines. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/cvar-return-capping.

<title>Conditional Front-door Adjustment for Heterogeneous Treatment Assignment Effect Estimation Under Non-adherence</title>

Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-adherence.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.

Abstract: Digital textbooks are widely used in various educational contexts, such as university courses and online lectures. Such textbooks yield learning log data that have been used in numerous educational data mining (EDM) studies for student behavior analysis and performance prediction. However, these studies have faced challenges in integrating confidential data, such as academic records and learning logs, across schools due to privacy concerns. Consequently, analyses are often conducted with data limited to a single school, which makes developing high-performing and generalizable models difficult. This study proposes a method that combines federated learning and differential features to address these issues. Federated learning enables model training without centralizing data, thereby preserving student privacy. Differential features, which utilize relative values instead of absolute values, enhance model performance and generalizability. To evaluate the proposed method, a model for predicting at-risk students was trained using data from 1,136 students across 12 courses conducted over 4 years, and validated on hold-out test data from 5 other courses. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method addresses privacy concerns while achieving performance comparable to that of models trained via centralized learning in terms of Top-n precision, nDCG, and PR-AUC. Furthermore, using differential features improved prediction performance across all evaluation datasets compared to non-differential approaches. The trained models were also applicable for early prediction, achieving high performance in detecting at-risk students in earlier stages of the semester within the validation datasets.

Abstract: It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses, focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies. We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem sizes up to $40{,}000$.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close performance gaps without retraining.

Abstract: Graph representation learning is effective for obtaining a meaningful latent space utilizing the structure of graph data and is widely applied, including biological networks. In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision. SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification (node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.

Our result also implies an improved high-probability regret bound for the bandit linear optimization, a special case with no perturbation. We also give a lower bound on the expected regret.

Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/MultiCrystalSpectrumSet.

Abstract: The identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) is critical for drug discovery and repositioning, as it reveals potential therapeutic uses of existing drugs, accelerating development and reducing costs. However, most existing models focus only on direct similarity in homogeneous graphs, failing to exploit the rich similarity in heterogeneous graphs. To address this gap, inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven Graph Learning (ADGL) module, learning global similarity through an affinity-enhanced drug-target graph, and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL) module, capturing higher-order similarity by amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors using an even-polynomial graph filter based on balance theory. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively capture similarity information across multiple interaction scales within affinity and association matrices. To address the issue of imbalance in DTI datasets, we propose an adjustable imbalance loss function that adjusts the weight of negative samples by the parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SOC-DGL consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Moreover, SOC-DGL successfully predicts the top 9 drugs known to bind ABL1, and further analyzed the 10th drug, which has not been experimentally confirmed to interact with ABL1, providing supporting evidence for its potential binding.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e., superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities, providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit communication scenarios.

<title>Frequency-Aligned Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Spatiotemporal Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics, and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD), which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler). However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset. The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at https://github.com/itsnotacie/SDKD

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and human-aligned reward models.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance. While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy, yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

<title>Greedy Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Learning with Convergence Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees. GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Sampling-based path planning algorithms play an important role in autonomous robotics. However, a common problem among these algorithms is that the initial path generated is not optimal, and the convergence is too slow for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel image-based learning algorithm using a Convolutional Block Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CBAGAN-RRT) with a combination of spatial and channel attention and a novel loss function to design the heuristics, find a better optimal path, and improve the convergence of the algorithm, both concerning time and speed. The probability distribution of the paths generated from our GAN model is used to guide the sampling process for the RRT algorithm. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using both the image quality generation metrics, like IOU Score, Dice Score, FID score, and path planning metrics like time cost and the number of nodes. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of various components in our network architecture. The advantage of our approach is that we can avoid the complicated preprocessing in the state space, our model can be generalized to complex environments like those containing turns and narrow passages without loss of accuracy, and our model can be easily integrated with other sampling-based path planning algorithms.

Abstract: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common cancer subtype, with an increasing incidence and a significant impact on cancer-related mortality. SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) within the context of discrete-time stationary Mean-Field Games (MFGs) characterized by finite state spaces and an infinite-horizon, discounted-reward setting. Although the resulting optimization problem is non-convex with respect to policies, we reformulate it as a convex optimization problem in terms of state-action occupation measures by leveraging the linear programming framework of Markov Decision Processes. Based on this convex reformulation, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm with a guaranteed convergence rate to efficiently compute the optimal solution. Moreover, we develop a new method that conceptualizes the MFG problem as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), enabling effective computation of the mean-field equilibrium for forward reinforcement learning (RL) problems and marking an advancement in MFG solution techniques. We further illustrate the practical applicability of our GNEP approach by employing this algorithm to generate data for numerical MFG examples.

Abstract: Conventional vehicle dynamics estimation methods suffer from the drawback of employing independent, separately calibrated filtering modules for each variable. To address this limitation, a recent proposal introduces a unified Twin-in-the-Loop (TiL) Observer architecture. This architecture replaces the simplified control-oriented vehicle model with a full-fledged vehicle simulator (digital twin), and employs a real-time correction mechanism using a linear time-invariant output error law. Bayesian Optimization is utilized to tune the observer due to the simulator's black-box nature, leading to a high-dimensional optimization problem. This paper focuses on developing a procedure to reduce the observer's complexity by exploring both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. The effectiveness of these strategies is validated for longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics using real-world data.

Abstract: Transfer entropy (TE) is an information theoretic measure that reveals the directional flow of information between processes, providing valuable insights for a wide range of real-world applications. This work proposes Transfer Entropy Estimation via Transformers (TREET), a novel attention-based approach for estimating TE for stationary processes. The proposed approach employs Donsker-Varadhan representation to TE and leverages the attention mechanism for the task of neural estimation. We propose a detailed theoretical and empirical study of the TREET, comparing it to existing methods on a dedicated estimation benchmark. To increase its applicability, we design an estimated TE optimization scheme that is motivated by the functional representation lemma, and use it to estimate the capacity of communication channels with memory, which is a canonical optimization problem in information theory. We further demonstrate how an optimized TREET can be used to estimate underlying densities, providing experimental results. Finally, we apply TREET to feature analysis of patients with Apnea, demonstrating its applicability to real-world physiological data. Our work, applied with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, opens a new door for communication problems which are yet to be solved.

Abstract: Despite extensive diagnostics and debugging by developers, AI systems sometimes exhibit harmful unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is so large -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may elicit harmful behaviors. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to improve robustness, however, they empirically struggle to fix failure modes that differ from the attacks used during training. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without leveraging knowledge of what they are or using inputs that elicit them. LAT makes use of the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. Here, we use it to defend against failure modes without examples that elicit them. Specifically, we use LAT to remove backdoors and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness to novel attacks and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

Abstract: We develop a general framework for estimating function-valued parameters under equality or inequality constraints in infinite-dimensional statistical models. Such constrained learning problems are common across many areas of statistics and machine learning, where estimated parameters must satisfy structural requirements such as moment restrictions, policy benchmarks, calibration criteria, or fairness considerations. To address these problems, we characterize the solution as the minimizer of a penalized population risk using a Lagrange-type formulation, and analyze it through a statistical functional lens. Central to our approach is a constraint-specific path through the unconstrained parameter space that defines the constrained solutions. For a broad class of constraint-risk pairs, this path admits closed-form expressions and reveals how constraints shape optimal adjustments. When closed forms are unavailable, we derive recursive representations that support tractable estimation. Our results also suggest natural estimators of the constrained parameter, constructed by combining estimates of unconstrained components of the data-generating distribution. Thus, our procedure can be integrated with any statistical learning approach and implemented using standard software. We provide general conditions under which the resulting estimators achieve optimal risk and constraint satisfaction, and we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method through various examples, simulations, and real-data applications.

Abstract: Mobile device control agents can largely enhance user interactions and productivity by automating daily tasks. However, despite growing interest in developing practical agents, the absence of a commonly adopted benchmark in this area makes it challenging to quantify scientific progress. In this work, we introduce B-MoCA: a novel benchmark with interactive environments for evaluating and developing mobile device control agents. To create a realistic benchmark, we develop B-MoCA based on the Android operating system and define 131 common daily tasks. Importantly, we incorporate a randomization feature that changes the configurations of mobile devices, including user interface layouts and language settings, to assess generalization performance. We benchmark diverse agents, including agents employing large language models (LLMs) or multi-modal LLMs as well as agents trained with imitation learning using human expert demonstrations. While these agents demonstrate proficiency in executing straightforward tasks, their poor performance on complex tasks highlights significant opportunities for future research to improve effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple yet effective strategy for exercise classification and muscle group activation prediction (MGAP). These tasks have significant implications for personal fitness, facilitating more affordable, accessible, safer, and simpler exercise routines. This is particularly relevant for novices and individuals with disabilities. Previous research in the field is mostly dominated by the reliance on mounted sensors and a limited scope of exercises, reducing practicality for everyday use. Furthermore, existing MGAP methodologies suffer from a similar dependency on sensors and a restricted range of muscle groups, often excluding strength training exercises, which are pivotal for a comprehensive fitness regimen. Addressing these limitations, our research employs a video-based deep learning framework that encompasses a broad spectrum of exercises and muscle groups, including those vital for strength training. Utilizing the "Workout/Exercises Video" dataset, our approach integrates the X3D and SlowFast video activity recognition models in an effective way to enhance exercise classification and MGAP performance. Our findings demonstrate that this hybrid method, obtained via weighted ensemble, outperforms existing baseline models in accuracy. Pretrained models play a crucial role in enhancing overall performance, with optimal channel reduction values for the SlowFast model identified near 10. Through an ablation study that explores fine-tuning, we further elucidate the interrelation between the two tasks. Our composite model, a weighted-average ensemble of X3D and SlowFast, sets a new benchmark in both exercise classification and MGAP across all evaluated categories, offering a robust solution to the limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: The popular frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech representations have largely focused on frame-level masked prediction of speech regions. While this has shown promising downstream task performance for speech recognition and related tasks, this has largely ignored factors of speech that are encoded at coarser level, like characteristics of the speaker or channel that remain consistent through-out a speech utterance. In this work, we propose a framework for Learning Disentangled Self Supervised (termed as Learn2Diss) representations of speech, which consists of frame-level and an utterance-level encoder modules. The two encoders are initially learned independently, where the frame-level model is largely inspired by existing self supervision techniques, thereby learning pseudo-phonemic representations, while the utterance-level encoder is inspired by constrastive learning of pooled embeddings, thereby learning pseudo-speaker representations. The joint learning of these two modules consists of disentangling the two encoders using a mutual information based criterion. With several downstream evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed Learn2Diss achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, with the frame-level encoder representations improving semantic tasks, while the utterance-level representations improve non-semantic tasks.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformers have been widely used in deep learning. Recent efforts have been devoted to incorporating transformer blocks into different neural architectures, including those with convolutions, leading to various visual transformers for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel and compact transformer block, Transformer with Learnable Token Merging (LTM), or LTM-Transformer. LTM-Transformer performs token merging in a learnable scheme. LTM-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact transformer networks, and it reduces the FLOPs and the inference time of the visual transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in popular visual transformers, including MobileViT, EfficientViT, ViT, and Swin, with LTM-Transformer blocks, leading to LTM-Transformer networks with different backbones. The LTM-Transformer is motivated by reduction of Information Bottleneck, and a novel and separable variational upper bound for the IB loss is derived. The architecture of the mask module in our LTM blocks, which generates the token merging mask, is designed to reduce the derived upper bound for the IB loss. Extensive results on computer vision tasks evidence that LTM-Transformer renders compact and efficient visual transformers with comparable or much better prediction accuracy than the original visual transformers. The code of the LTM-Transformer is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/LTM}

arXiv:2407.19707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.

arXiv:2409.03034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for representing neural fields on triangle meshes that is multi-resolution across both spatial and frequency domains. Inspired by the Neural Fourier Filter Bank (NFFB), our architecture decomposes the spatial and frequency domains by associating finer spatial resolution levels with higher frequency bands, while coarser resolutions are mapped to lower frequencies. To achieve geometry-aware spatial decomposition we leverage multiple DiffusionNet components, each associated with a different spatial resolution level. Subsequently, we apply a Fourier feature mapping to encourage finer resolution levels to be associated with higher frequencies. The final signal is composed in a wavelet-inspired manner using a sine-activated MLP, aggregating higher-frequency signals on top of lower-frequency ones. Our architecture attains high accuracy in learning complex neural fields and is robust to discontinuities, exponential scale variations of the target field, and mesh modification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through its application to diverse neural fields, such as synthetic RGB functions, UV texture coordinates, and vertex normals, illustrating different challenges. To validate our method, we compare its performance against two alternatives, showcasing the advantages of our multi-resolution architecture.

<title>Sortformer: A Novel Approach for Permutation-Resolved Speaker Supervision in Speech-to-Text Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2409.06656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sortformer is an encoder-based speaker diarization model designed for supervising speaker tagging in speech-to-text models. Instead of relying solely on permutation invariant loss (PIL), Sortformer introduces Sort Loss to resolve the permutation problem, either independently or in tandem with PIL. In addition, we propose a streamlined multi-speaker speech-to-text architecture that leverages Sortformer for speaker supervision, embedding speaker labels into the encoder using sinusoidal kernel functions. This design addresses the speaker permutation problem through sorted objectives, effectively bridging timestamps and tokens to supervise speaker labels in the output transcriptions. Experiments demonstrate that Sort Loss can boost speaker diarization performance, and incorporating the speaker supervision from Sortformer improves multi-speaker transcription accuracy. We anticipate that the proposed Sortformer and multi-speaker architecture will enable the seamless integration of speaker tagging capabilities into foundational speech-to-text systems and multimodal large language models (LLMs), offering an easily adoptable and user-friendly mechanism to enhance their versatility and performance in speaker-aware tasks. The code and trained models are made publicly available through the NVIDIA NeMo Framework.

<title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Abstraction of Listwise Recommendation</title>

arXiv:2409.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern listwise recommendation systems need to consider both long-term user perceptions and short-term interest shifts. Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency. Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation. Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem. We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively. To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment. Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines. Data and codes have been made public.

arXiv:2409.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown.

<title>Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability</title>

arXiv:2410.04489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of grokking -- delayed generalization accompanied by non-monotonic test loss behavior -- in a simple binary logistic classification task, for which "memorizing" and "generalizing" solutions can be strictly defined. Surprisingly, we find that grokking arises naturally even in this minimal model when the parameters of the problem are close to a critical point, and provide both empirical and analytical insights into its mechanism. Concretely, by appealing to the implicit bias of gradient descent, we show that logistic regression can exhibit grokking when the training dataset is nearly linearly separable from the origin and there is strong noise in the perpendicular directions. The underlying reason is that near the critical point, "flat" directions in the loss landscape with nearly zero gradient cause training dynamics to linger for arbitrarily long times near quasi-stable solutions before eventually reaching the global minimum. Finally, we highlight similarities between our findings and the recent literature, strengthening the conjecture that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.

arXiv:2410.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method that allows efficient and safe approximation of model predictive controllers using kernel interpolation. Since the computational complexity of the approximating function scales linearly with the number of data points, we propose to use a scoring function which chooses the most promising data. To further reduce the complexity of the approximation, we restrict our considerations to the set of closed-loop reachable states. That is, the approximating function only has to be accurate within this set. This makes our method especially suited for systems, where the set of initial conditions is small. In order to guarantee safety and high performance of the designed approximated controller, we use reachability analysis based on Monte Carlo methods.

Abstract: The challenging deployment of compute- and memory-intensive methods from Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based Continual Learning (CL) underscores the critical need for a paradigm shift towards more efficient approaches. Neuromorphic Continual Learning (NCL) appears as an emerging solution, by leveraging the principles of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which enable efficient CL algorithms executed in dynamically-changed environments with resource-constrained computing systems. Motivated by the need for a holistic study of NCL, in this survey, we first provide a detailed background on CL, encompassing the desiderata, settings, metrics, scenario taxonomy, Online Continual Learning (OCL) paradigm, recent DNN-based methods to address catastrophic forgetting (CF). Then, we analyze these methods considering CL desiderata, computational and memory costs, as well as network complexity, hence emphasizing the need for energy-efficient CL. Afterward, we provide background of low-power neuromorphic systems including encoding techniques, neuronal dynamics, network architectures, learning rules, hardware processors, software and hardware frameworks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Then, this survey comprehensively reviews and analyzes state-of-the-art in NCL. The key ideas, implementation frameworks, and performance assessments are also provided. This survey covers several hybrid approaches that combine supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. It also covers optimization techniques including SNN operations reduction, weight quantization, and knowledge distillation. Then, this survey discusses the progress of real-world NCL applications. Finally, this paper provides a future perspective on the open research challenges for NCL, since the purpose of this study is to be useful for the wider neuromorphic AI research community and to inspire future research in bio-plausible OCL.

Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics. The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on. Our model, code and weights are available at https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun.

Abstract: Recently, generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have been redefining what is possible for AI agents that take information flows as input and produce intelligent behavior. As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers.
  Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods. A curated collection of relevant research papers is maintained on our GitHub repository, serving as a resource for ongoing research and development in this field: https://github.com/clmoro/Robotics-RL-FMs-Integration.

Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.

Abstract: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches typically evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or through exact matches with predefined closed knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods are limited due to their reliance on evaluation metrics originally designed for other purposes and constraints from closed knowledge sources. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\textcolor{skyblue}{Ev\textsuperscript{2}}\textcolor{orangebrown}{R}} which combines the strengths of reference-based evaluation and verdict-level proxy scoring. Ev\textsuperscript{2}R jointly assesses how well the evidence aligns with the gold references and how reliably it supports the verdict, addressing the shortcomings of prior methods. We evaluate Ev\textsuperscript{2}R against three types of evidence evaluation approaches: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less baselines. Assessments against human ratings and adversarial tests demonstrate that Ev\textsuperscript{2}R consistently outperforms existing scoring approaches in accuracy and robustness. It achieves stronger correlation with human judgments and greater robustness to adversarial perturbations, establishing it as a reliable metric for evidence evaluation in AFC.\footnote{Code is available at \href{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}.}

arXiv:2411.15265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based methods are a prototypical family of explainability techniques, especially for image-based models. Nonetheless, they have several shortcomings in that they (1) require white-box access to models, (2) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and (3) produce attributions that lie off the image manifold, leading to explanations that are not actually faithful to the model and do not align well with human perception. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Derivative-Free Diffusion Manifold-Constrainted Gradients (FreeMCG), a novel method that serves as an improved basis for explainability of a given neural network than the traditional gradient. Specifically, by leveraging ensemble Kalman filters and diffusion models, we derive a derivative-free approximation of the model's gradient projected onto the data manifold, requiring access only to the model's outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FreeMCG by applying it to both counterfactual generation and feature attribution, which have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on both tasks, counterfactual explanation and feature attribution, we show that our method yields state-of-the-art results while preserving the essential properties expected of XAI tools.

Abstract: Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method and finite volume method, adress partial differential equations (PDEs) by discretizing them into algebraic equations and solving these iteratively. However, this process is often computationally expensive and time-consuming. An alternative approach involves transforming PDEs into integral equations and solving them using Green's functions, which provide analytical solutions. Nevertheless, deriving Green's functions analytically is a challenging and non-trivial task, particularly for complex systems. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, termed GreensONet, which is constructed based on the strucutre of deep operator networks (DeepONet) to learn embedded Green's functions and solve PDEs via Green's integral formulation. Specifically, the Trunk Net within GreensONet is designed to approximate the unknown Green's functions of the system, while the Branch Net are utilized to approximate the auxiliary gradients of the Green's function. These outputs are subsequently employed to perform surface integrals and volume integrals, incorporating user-defined boundary conditions and source terms, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on three types of PDEs in bounded domains: 3D heat conduction equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Stokes equations. Comparative results in these cases demonstrate that GreenONet's accuracy and generalization ability surpass those of existing methods, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), DeepONet, Physics-Informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet), and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO).

Abstract: While transformers demonstrate outstanding performance across various audio tasks, their application to neural vocoders remains challenging. Neural vocoders require the generation of long audio signals at the sample level, which demands high temporal resolution. This results in significant computational costs for attention map generation and limits their ability to efficiently process both global and local information. Additionally, the sequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties for real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers impractical. To address these challenges, we propose RingFormer, a neural vocoder that incorporates the ring attention mechanism into a lightweight transformer variant, the convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer). Ring attention effectively captures local details while integrating global information, making it well-suited for processing long sequences and enabling real-time audio generation. RingFormer is trained using adversarial training with two discriminators. The proposed model is applied to the decoder of the text-to-speech model VITS and compared with state-of-the-art vocoders such as HiFi-GAN, iSTFT-Net, and BigVGAN under identical conditions using various objective and subjective metrics. Experimental results show that RingFormer achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models, particularly excelling in real-time audio generation. Our code and audio samples are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Local Polynomial Regression (LPR) is a widely used nonparametric method for modeling complex relationships due to its flexibility and simplicity. It estimates a regression function by fitting low-degree polynomials to localized subsets of the data, weighted by proximity. However, traditional LPR is sensitive to outliers and high-leverage points, which can significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper revisits the kernel function used to compute regression weights and proposes a novel framework that incorporates both predictor and response variables in the weighting mechanism. The focus of this work is a conditional density kernel that robustly estimates weights by mitigating the influence of outliers through localized density estimation. A related joint density kernel is also discussed in an appendix. The proposed method is implemented in Python and is publicly available at https://github.com/yaniv-shulman/rsklpr, demonstrating competitive performance in synthetic benchmark experiments. Compared to standard LPR, the proposed approach consistently improves robustness and accuracy, especially in heteroscedastic and noisy environments, without requiring multiple iterations. This advancement provides a promising extension to traditional LPR, opening new possibilities for robust regression applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces HEPPO-GAE, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to optimize the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) stage in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike previous approaches that focused on trajectory collection and actor-critic updates, HEPPO-GAE addresses GAE's computational demands with a parallel, pipelined architecture implemented on a single System-on-Chip (SoC). This design allows for the adaptation of various hardware accelerators tailored for different PPO phases. A key innovation is our strategic standardization technique, which combines dynamic reward standardization and block standardization for values, followed by 8-bit uniform quantization. This method stabilizes learning, enhances performance, and manages memory bottlenecks, achieving a 4x reduction in memory usage and a 1.5x increase in cumulative rewards. We propose a solution on a single SoC device with programmable logic and embedded processors, delivering throughput orders of magnitude higher than traditional CPU-GPU systems. Our single-chip solution minimizes communication latency and throughput bottlenecks, significantly boosting PPO training efficiency. Experimental results show a 30% increase in PPO speed and a substantial reduction in memory access time, underscoring HEPPO-GAE's potential for broad applicability in hardware-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in visually interpreting medical time-series data. However, their general-purpose design can limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models poses challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.

<title>The Elicitation Game: Evaluating Capability Elicitation Techniques</title>

Abstract: Capability evaluations are required to understand and regulate AI systems that may be deployed or further developed. Therefore, it is important that evaluations provide an accurate estimation of an AI system's capabilities. However, in numerous cases, previously latent capabilities have been elicited from models, sometimes long after initial release. Accordingly, substantial efforts have been made to develop methods for eliciting latent capabilities from models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of capability elicitation techniques by intentionally training model organisms -- language models with hidden capabilities that are revealed by a password. We introduce a novel method for training model organisms, based on circuit-breaking, which is more robust to elicitation techniques than standard password-locked models. We focus on elicitation techniques based on prompting and activation steering, and compare these to fine-tuning methods. Prompting techniques can elicit the actual capability of both password-locked and circuit-broken model organisms in the MCQA setting, while steering fails to do so. For a code-generation task, only fine-tuning can elicit the hidden capabilities of our novel model organism. Additionally, our results suggest that combining techniques improves elicitation. Still, if possible, fine-tuning should be the method of choice to improve the trustworthiness of capability evaluations.

<title>Optimal Task Order for Continual Learning of Multiple Tasks</title>

Abstract: Continual learning of multiple tasks remains a major challenge for neural networks. Here, we investigate how task order influences continual learning and propose a strategy for optimizing it. Leveraging a linear teacher-student model with latent factors, we derive an analytical expression relating task similarity and ordering to learning performance. Our analysis reveals two principles that hold under a wide parameter range: (1) tasks should be arranged from the least representative to the most typical, and (2) adjacent tasks should be dissimilar. We validate these rules on both synthetic data and real-world image classification datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), demonstrating consistent performance improvements in both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Our work thus presents a generalizable framework for task-order optimization in task-incremental continual learning.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.

Abstract: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) encode interwoven scientific knowledge, using chemical elements and LLaMA-series models as a case study. We identify a 3D spiral structure in the hidden states that aligns with the conceptual structure of the periodic table, suggesting that LLMs can reflect the geometric organization of scientific concepts learned from text. Linear probing reveals that middle layers encode continuous, overlapping attributes that enable indirect recall, while deeper layers sharpen categorical distinctions and incorporate linguistic context. These findings suggest that LLMs represent symbolic knowledge not as isolated facts, but as structured geometric manifolds that intertwine semantic information across layers. We hope this work inspires further exploration of how LLMs represent and reason about scientific knowledge, particularly in domains such as materials science.

<title>Steering into New Embedding Spaces: Analyzing Cross-Lingual Alignment Induced by Model Interventions in Multilingual Language Models</title>

Abstract: Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in customer support is constrained by hallucination (generating false information) and the high cost of proprietary models. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline and explore how to balance human input and automation. Using a dataset of questions about a Samsung Smart TV user manual, we demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs outperforms crowdsourced data in reducing hallucination in finetuned models. We also compare self-training (fine-tuning models on their own outputs) and knowledge distillation (fine-tuning on stronger models' outputs, e.g., GPT-4o), and find that self-training achieves comparable hallucination reduction. We conjecture that this surprising finding can be attributed to increased exposure bias issues in the knowledge distillation case and support this conjecture with post hoc analysis. We also improve robustness to unanswerable questions and retrieval failures with contextualized "I don't know" responses. These findings show that scalable, cost-efficient QA systems can be built using synthetic data and self-training with open-source models, reducing reliance on proprietary tools or costly human annotations.

<title>Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.05641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown notable potential in code generation for optimization algorithms, unlocking exciting new opportunities. This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.

<title>A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. STAR supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR exhibits superior effectiveness (10.5%-19.9% improvements) and efficiency (2.4-7.0 times speedup). In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact.

Abstract: Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for communication and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and action. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-task question answering, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Speaking with Intent over direct generation without explicit intent. Further analysis corroborates the generalizability of SWI under different experimental settings. Moreover, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. The promising results in enhancing LLMs with explicit intents pave a new avenue for boosting LLMs' generation and reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.

Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains underdiagnosed in clinical settings, presenting opportunities for automated detection to identify patients. This study evaluates natural language processing approaches for detecting PTSD from clinical interview transcripts. We compared general and mental health-specific transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa), embedding-based methods (SentenceBERT/LLaMA), and large language model prompting strategies (zero-shot/few-shot/chain-of-thought) using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Domain-specific end-to-end models significantly outperformed general models (Mental-RoBERTa AUPRC=0.675+/-0.084 vs. RoBERTa-base 0.599+/-0.145). SentenceBERT embeddings with neural networks achieved the highest overall performance (AUPRC=0.758+/-0.128). Few-shot prompting using DSM-5 criteria yielded competitive results with two examples (AUPRC=0.737). Performance varied significantly across symptom severity and comorbidity status with depression, with higher accuracy for severe PTSD cases and patients with comorbid depression. Our findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted embeddings and LLMs for scalable screening while underscoring the need for improved detection of nuanced presentations and offering insights for developing clinically viable AI tools for PTSD assessment.

Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

Abstract: Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from reinforcement learning (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for mathematical reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to automatically constructing abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced mathematics problems by developing EFAGen, which operationalizes the task of automatically inferring an EFA for a given seed problem and solution as a program synthesis task. We first formalize the properties of any valid EFA as executable unit tests. Using execution feedback from the unit tests, we search over candidate programs sampled from a LLM to find EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. We then apply the tests as a reward signal, training LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We show that EFAs inferred by EFAGen are faithful to the seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show uses of model-written EFAs e.g., finding harder/easier problem variants, as well as data generation.

arXiv:2504.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient, enabling stability under small input variations. Additionally, we refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d, lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work could explore adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios

Abstract: We present SemiOccam, an image recognition network that leverages semi-supervised learning in a highly efficient manner. Existing works often rely on complex training techniques and architectures, requiring hundreds of GPU hours for training, while their generalization ability with extremely limited labeled data remains to be improved. To address these limitations, we construct a hierarchical mixture density classification mechanism by optimizing mutual information between feature representations and target classes, compressing redundant information while retaining crucial discriminative components. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three commonly used datasets, with accuracy exceeding 95% on two of them using only 4 labeled samples per class, and its simple architecture keeps training time at the minute level. Notably, this paper reveals a long-overlooked data leakage issue in the STL-10 dataset for semi-supervised learning and removes duplicates to ensure reliable experimental results. We release the deduplicated CleanSTL-10 dataset to facilitate fair and reproducible research. Code available at https://github.com/Shu1L0n9/SemiOccam.

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification. Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal component analysis (PCA) using Oja's algorithm, enabling the construction of confidence intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most existing works on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error guarantees. Recently, there has been some interest in uncertainty quantification for the sin-squared error. However, uncertainty quantification or sharp error guarantees for entries of the estimated eigenvector in the streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive a sharp Bernstein-type concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector matching the optimal error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central Limit Theorem for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent subsampling algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically achieving similar accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being significantly more computationally efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in providing reliable uncertainty estimates with a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have led to remarkable interest in using systems that rely on large language models (LLMs) for practical applications. However, meaningful evaluation of these systems in real-world scenarios comes with a distinct set of challenges, which are not well-addressed by synthetic benchmarks and de-facto metrics that are often seen in the literature. We present a practical evaluation framework which outlines how to proactively curate representative datasets, select meaningful evaluation metrics, and employ meaningful evaluation methodologies that integrate well with practical development and deployment of LLM-reliant systems that must adhere to real-world requirements and meet user-facing needs.

<title>The Perception of Phase Intercept Distortion and its Application in Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.

<title>Faster Low-Rank Approximation and Kernel Ridge Regression via the Block-Nystr\"om Method</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17556</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.17556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method, thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.

Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.

<title>Automated Classification of Volcanic Earthquakes Using Transformer Encoders: Insights into Data Quality and Model Interpretability</title>

arXiv:2507.01260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However, traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method. To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed, revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.

<title>Interaction-Merged Motion Planning: Effectively Leveraging Diverse Motion Datasets for Robust Planning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.

<title>Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.05470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a principled framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals for non-stationary time series. TCP integrates a machine learning-based quantile forecaster with an online conformal calibration layer. This layer's thresholds are updated via a modified Robbins-Monro scheme, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to volatility clustering and regime shifts without rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across diverse financial assets. Our empirical results reveal a critical flaw in static methods: while sharp, Quantile Regression is poorly calibrated, systematically over-covering the nominal 95% target. In contrast, TCP's adaptive mechanism actively works to achieve the correct coverage level, successfully navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff. Visualizations during the 2020 market crash confirm TCP's superior adaptive response, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates the framework's robustness to hyperparameter choices. Overall, TCP offers a practical and theoretically-grounded solution to the central challenge of calibrated uncertainty quantification for time series under distribution shift, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning.

<title>Improving AEBS Validation Through Objective Intervention Classification Leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle</title>

arXiv:2507.07872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP) system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) - is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues. Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths, limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

<title>Lizard: An Efficient Linearization Framework for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.09025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have advanced computer vision and medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning, aiding CADD with limited data. However, their deployment faces two key challenges. \textit{distribution shift} where pre-training and post-training data distributions differ (e.g., due to inter-center image acquisition) and \textit{confidence misalignment}, which leads to overconfident errors. These issues surface differently, vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) suffer from 2D embedding shift (image-text misalignment), while medical models (e.g., SAM) encounter 3D domain shifts (e.g., scanner variation) and voxel-wise calibration need. Existing solutions are domain-specific. We propose \textbf{StaRFM}, a fusion of Fisher information penalty (FIP) and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) tackling both challenges. It applies FIP, extended to 3D via patch-wise regularization, to reduce embedding shift, and CMP, reformulated for voxel-level predictions, to calibrate segmentation uncertainty. We derive PAC-Bayes bounds. FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, and CMP reduces calibration error via Brier score minimization. StaRFM surpasses baselines by \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19 vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), achieves +4.2\% DSC over SAM-FT and 4.8mm HD95 on medical benchmarks (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and reduces cross-domain gaps by up to 20\%. The framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes. Code and models are available at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/StaRFM-C0CD/}{\textcolor{blue}{\underline{StaRFM}}}

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom (PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively. Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets, 2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2 scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM, and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where applicable. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/zwxu064/DAAStar.git.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging. These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

arXiv:2507.09795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information. Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. The code is available at https://github.com/ah-ansari/NegRefine.

arXiv:2507.10524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the challenges in generating samples with user-specified properties using diffusion models and proposes a solution called Feynman-Kac (FK) steering. FK steering is an inference-time framework that involves sampling multiple interacting diffusion processes, or particles, and resampling them based on rewards defined by potential functions. These potentials guide the particles towards high-reward samples. The study evaluates FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models, showing that it outperforms fine-tuned models in terms of prompt fidelity and sample quality. FK steering allows for faster sampling, controllability of attributes like toxicity, and generates more linguistically acceptable outputs. The results highlight the effectiveness of inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, in improving sample quality and controllability. The code for FK steering is available for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

Summary:
The article discusses the transformer architecture introduced in 2017 for natural language processing, highlighting its reliance on an attention mechanism to establish global dependencies. The authors argue that a gap exists in the theoretical understanding of the transformer's working principles from a physical perspective. They propose constructing physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of tokens to represent large language models as open quantum systems. These physical models serve as the foundation for understanding and implementing the transformer architecture in large language models. <div>

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017}) marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture for large language models.

The article proposes a new approach to text-to-image (T2I) models to account for diverse human experiences, aiming for pluralistic alignment with conflicting values. The authors introduce a novel dataset, DIVE, for diverse intersectional visual evaluation, allowing for deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives through demographic intersectional human raters' feedback. They show that demographics are crucial proxies for diverse viewpoints and reveal context-dependent differences in harm perception.

This research provides foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I systems.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication, capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain, revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that diverge from conventional evaluations.

<div> normalization, machine learning, copula theory, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, HCR interpretation

Summary:
Data normalization plays a crucial role in machine learning, traditionally achieved through mean subtraction and standard deviation division or by rescaling to a fixed range. In copula theory, normalization to approximate quantiles using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) transforms data to a nearly uniform distribution in [0,1] for simpler representations and reduced overfitting. This approach is relatively unknown in machine learning but shows promise in enhancing predictions, as demonstrated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). By switching from rescaling to CDF normalization, KANs can yield improved results. Moreover, in the HCR interpretation, the weights of neurons with CDF normalization represent mixed moments, allowing for local joint distribution modeling and the propagation of probability distributions, potentially altering the direction of propagation. <div>

Abstract: Data normalization is crucial in machine learning, usually performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, or by rescaling to a fixed range. In copula theory, popular in finance, there is used normalization to approximately quantiles by transforming x to CDF(x) with estimated CDF (cumulative distribution function) to nearly uniform distribution in [0,1], allowing for simpler representations which are less likely to overfit. It seems nearly unknown in machine learning, therefore, we would like to present some its advantages on example of recently popular Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), improving predictions from Legendre-KAN by just switching rescaling to CDF normalization. Additionally, in HCR interpretation, weights of such neurons are mixed moments providing local joint distribution models, allow to propagate also probability distributions, and change propagation direction.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to automatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on manual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data. Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method consistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning architectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness and adaptability are critical.

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains; especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under uncertainty.

Summary:
Soft-ECM is a new algorithm proposed in this paper to address the clustering of complex data types such as mixed data and time series. Unlike existing algorithms that rely on Euclidean spaces for data representation, Soft-ECM uses a semi-metric to position centroids of imprecise clusters in a consistent manner. Experimental results show that Soft-ECM performs comparably to traditional fuzzy clustering methods on numerical data and excels in handling mixed data and combining fuzzy clustering with semi-metrics like DTW for time series analysis. This approach fills a gap in the existing clustering algorithms, providing a solution for clustering complex data types that were previously challenging to analyze. <div>
arXiv:2507.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general, not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.

Summary: 
This research introduces a new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining method to enhance human activity recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors. The study aims to detect abnormal movements in patients with movement disorders for remote health monitoring. The approach utilizes large-scale unlabeled IMU-video data to learn representations, improving generalizability across different environments and populations. Results show superior performance in HAR tasks on out-of-distribution IMU datasets, including those from Parkinson's disease patients. The cross-modal pretraining approach surpasses existing IMU-video and IMU-only pretraining methods under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations. This study suggests that cross-modal pretraining is beneficial for learning generalizable data representations in dynamic data modalities like IMU signals. The software implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration and application.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders, the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets, including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease. Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations. Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities, such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn generalizable data representations.

Summary:
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has been crucial for training agents in decision-making under uncertainty. However, using deep neural networks in model-free RL can lead to issues such as sample inefficiency and limited interpretability. This work introduces model-based agents as an alternative for policy approximation, utilizing adaptable models of system dynamics. Model-based agents can incorporate prior system knowledge to improve decision-making. The interplay between model-based agents and model-free RL remains underexplored but shows potential for sample-efficient learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents. This approach, exemplified by model predictive control, offers benefits in safe policy learning and decision-making. Learning approaches like Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies play a role in this method. Overall, combining model-based agents with model-free RL shows promise in improving decision-making processes in autonomous systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions, while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents -- exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies, along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored, motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors delve into the mechanisms behind in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). They introduce a unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations in LLMs converge both over context and across layers. This process leads to an implicit bias towards smooth representations, which is proven analytically and verified empirically. The theory explains why learned representations exhibit globally structured but locally distorted geometry and why their total energy decays without vanishing. It also predicts that ICL has inherent robustness towards high-frequency noise, a prediction which is empirically confirmed. This study provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL and offers a theoretical foundation for further exploration in different data distributions and settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data distributions and settings.

Summary: 
The study introduces the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction objectively. It addresses the limitations of traditional parameters like ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain by leveraging Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and neural networks to capture spatiotemporal dynamics from echocardiographic sequences. The model incorporates clinical metadata to provide a continuous risk score from 0 to 1. In a cohort of 736 patients, the Acoustic Index demonstrated high accuracy with an AUC of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation confirmed its robustness, showing sensitivity and specificity exceeding 0.8 on independent data. Threshold-based analysis revealed stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, indicating optimal discrimination near the threshold. The Acoustic Index offers a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of cardiac function, with potential applications in triage and disease-specific classifiers.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning, resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to disease-specific classifiers.

Summary:
This paper introduces two metrics, the spectral predictability score and the Lyapunov exponent, to assess the forecastability of time series data before model development. The spectral predictability score evaluates the frequency components' strength and regularity in the time series, while the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the data-generating system. The study evaluates these metrics on synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset and finds a strong correlation between the metrics and actual forecast performance. Understanding the forecastability of time series prior to model training can help practitioners focus on more forecastable products and supply chain levels, while adjusting expectations or exploring alternative strategies for less forecastable products.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data. We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative strategies for products with limited forecastability.

<div> self-Transformer, expressive power, input-adaptive alignment, encoder architectures, iterative reasoning
Summary:
The article introduces the SELF-Transformer, an encoder layer that refines its own attention weights iteratively to a fixed point. Unlike traditional Transformers, the SELF-Transformer does not rely on token-level autoregression, instead adapting its alignment matrix internally based on input difficulty. This adaptivity leads to improved accuracy on encoder-style benchmarks without increasing parameter count, highlighting the benefits of input-adaptive alignment at test time. By incorporating iterative reasoning without the need for token-level autoregression, the SELF-Transformer significantly boosts the expressive power of encoder architectures. Overall, the self-Transformer offers a simpler yet more effective approach to achieving chain-of-thought reasoning in Transformers. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and, more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning, biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget. Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

<div> Keywords: large language model, reinforcement learning, user preferences, personalized responses, text-based summarization

Summary:
The study introduces a novel framework called PLUS, which utilizes text-based summarization to personalize responses from large language models (LLMs) based on individual user preferences. By learning summaries of each user's characteristics and conversations, PLUS enables personalized predictions for different users, improving the overall user experience. The framework is trained using reinforcement learning, updating the reward model to create a personalized user experience. The method is robust across varied user datasets and conversation topics, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Furthermore, the user summaries generated by PLUS can be easily transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger AI models like GPT-4. This approach not only enhances transparency and user control in LLM alignment but also provides concise and portable user summaries for easier interpretation and modification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

<div> Estimators; Matching markets; Off-policy evaluation; Recommendation systems; Job-matching platform <br />
<br />Summary: 
Matching users with mutual preferences is crucial for services like job search and dating apps. A/B tests are costly for evaluating new policies in recommender systems, making Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) important for assessing recommendation policies using logged data. However, in matching platforms, user interactions' bidirectional nature and large scale introduce variance and reward sparsity issues, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address this, novel OPE estimators DiPS and DPR are proposed for matching markets, combining elements of different estimators and incorporating intermediate labels for better bias-variance control. The bias and variance of these estimators are theoretically derived, showing advantages over conventional methods. These estimators can also be extended for offline policy learning to improve recommendation policies. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data and real job-matching platform logs demonstrates the superiority of the proposed methods for off-policy evaluation and learning tasks across various configurations. <div>

Abstract: Matching users based on mutual preferences is a fundamental aspect of services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search and dating applications. Although A/B tests remain the gold standard for evaluating new policies in recommender systems for matching markets, it is costly and impractical for frequent policy updates. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays a crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only offline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike conventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature of user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and exacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address these challenges and facilitate effective offline evaluation, we propose novel OPE estimators, \textit{DiPS} and \textit{DPR}, specifically designed for matching markets. Our methods combine elements of the Direct Method (DM), Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators while incorporating intermediate labels, such as initial engagement signals, to achieve better bias-variance control in matching markets. Theoretically, we derive the bias and variance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their advantages over conventional methods. Furthermore, we show that these estimators can be seamlessly extended to offline policy learning methods for improving recommendation policies for making more matches. We empirically evaluate our methods through experiments on both synthetic data and A/B testing logs from a real job-matching platform. The empirical results highlight the superiority of our approach over existing methods in off-policy evaluation and learning tasks for a variety of configurations.

Tri-GFN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with accuracy improvements of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14% on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58% on the USPS dataset.

Abstract: In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.

<div> client-skipping algorithm, federated learning, digital twins, bandwidth-constrained, resource-aware

Summary:<br /><br /> 
The article introduces FedSkipTwin, a client-skipping algorithm for federated learning that leverages server-side digital twins to reduce communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained environments. The digital twins, implemented as simple LSTMs, forecast client update magnitudes and uncertainties based on historical gradient norms. The server uses these predictions to determine when to request communication from clients, leading to a 12-15.5% reduction in total communication across 20 rounds. Additionally, final model accuracy is improved by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the standard FedAvg algorithm. The experiments conducted on UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients under a non-IID data distribution validate the effectiveness of FedSkipTwin in optimizing communication in federated learning settings. <div>
arXiv:2507.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning (FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins. Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions, requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold; otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth. Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

Summary: 
This study introduces two novel architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which combine Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with GRU and LSTM networks to enhance the predictive capability of loan default models more than three months in advance. The proposed models outperform existing baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUC, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months in advance and over 88% eight months in advance. This addresses the challenge of early identification of default events in time series anomaly detection, enabling financial institutions to implement preventive measures before risk events materialize. Existing methods lack accuracy in early predictions and depend on training and testing within specific time frames, limiting their practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in improving the early detection of loan defaults. <div>

Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in time series anomaly detection: enhancing the predictive capability of loan default models more than three months in advance to enable early identification of default events, helping financial institutions implement preventive measures before risk events materialize. Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months in advance and over 88% eight months in advance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

arXiv:2507.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.

Summary: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) was compared to scalarized alternatives using a simple Pareto-based strategy (EHVI) against a fixed-weight scalarized baseline (EI) in molecular design tasks. Results showed EHVI outperformed in Pareto front coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. Even strong deterministic instantiations of scalarization underperformed in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) -- against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement (EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization, especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.

<div> Efficient representation, Deformable bodies, Graph Neural Networks, Adaptive Spatial Tokenization, Large-scale simulations. 
Summary: 
The article introduces an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST) method for efficient representation of physical states in simulating interactions between deformable bodies. The method divides the simulation space into a grid of cells to map unstructured meshes onto a structured grid, grouping adjacent mesh nodes. A cross-attention module is then applied to map sparse cells into a fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the physical state. Self-attention modules predict the next state over these tokens in latent space, improving accuracy and scalability of simulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, particularly on large-scale simulations with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes. Additionally, a novel large-scale dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions is introduced to support future research in the field.

arXiv:2507.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST) method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact, fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state. Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support future research in this area.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component failures in autonomous cargo ships (ACS) and the uncertainties in emergency decision-making, this paper proposes a novel hybrid feature fusion framework for constructing a graph-structured dataset of failure modes. By employing an improved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to the NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature fusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode subsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes, and 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks. Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are highly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based Meteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high prediction accuracy. This paper not only provides a solid foundation for failure analysis in autonomous cargo ships but also offers reliable support for fault diagnosis, risk assessment, and intelligent decision-making systems.

Summary:<br />
This study investigates the impact of adversarial training on improving both generalization performance and adversarial robustness in audio classification tasks. Two different adversarial training strategies, output-space attacks and embedding-space attacks, are examined using two model architectures, ConvNeXt and AudioProtoPNet, on a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. The research focuses on addressing distribution shifts between training and test data, a common real-world challenge in audio classification. The results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space attacks, enhances clean test data performance and strengthens the models' robustness against adversarial attacks. The study also assesses the stability of learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks for the AudioProtoPNet model. These findings suggest that adversarial training has the potential to improve robustness in challenging audio classification scenarios involving significant distribution shifts and adversarial threats.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under substantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different adversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and adversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model architectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an inherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach is evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This benchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training and test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a common real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial training strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the classification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks designed to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses the stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks. Results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space attacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative and simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These findings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial training holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance. SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a 15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately 70%.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph clustering is crucial for unraveling intricate data structures, yet it presents significant challenges due to its unsupervised nature. Recently, goal-directed clustering techniques have yielded impressive results, with contrastive learning methods leveraging pseudo-label garnering considerable attention. Nonetheless, pseudo-label as a supervision signal is unreliable and existing goal-directed approaches utilize only features to construct a single-target distribution for single-center optimization, which lead to incomplete and less dependable guidance. In our work, we propose a novel Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) approach based on neighbor distribution properties, which includes representation learning with neighbor distribution and dual-center optimization. Specifically, we utilize neighbor distribution as a supervision signal to mine hard negative samples in contrastive learning, which is reliable and enhances the effectiveness of representation learning. Furthermore, neighbor distribution center is introduced alongside feature center to jointly construct a dual-target distribution for dual-center optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate superior performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

Summary:<br /> 
- The creation of interatomic machine learning force fields is a challenging task due to computational complexity.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models on large databases can reduce the amount of training data required for accuracy.
- On-the-fly learning automates the creation of a training dataset by using model uncertainty during simulations.

- An on-the-fly workflow is implemented to automatically fine-tune the model while maintaining accuracy and detecting rare events such as transition states. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors focus on a variant of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem where the reward function is submodular, representing diminishing returns. They propose a pruned submodularity graph-based approach to find an optimal policy that maximizes this submodular reward function efficiently. The approach is analyzed for time and space requirements, as well as performance guarantees. Experimental results on a benchmark agent-environment setup show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, obtaining higher rewards. The study highlights the importance of considering submodular reward functions in RL problems and provides a practical solution for optimizing such functions in a feasible computation time. This research contributes to the broader understanding of RL in real-world problems with complex reward structures. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control, etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

Three self-supervised methods were tested on multiple gene expression datasets to assess their effectiveness in capturing complex information and improving phenotype prediction accuracy. The results show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform traditional supervised models and reduce the reliance on annotated data. The study provides a detailed analysis of each method's performance, highlighting strengths and limitations, and offers recommendations for their use based on the research scenario. Additionally, future research directions to enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene expression data analysis are outlined. This is the first study to focus on bulk RNA-Seq data in conjunction with self-supervised learning. <div>
arXiv:2507.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

<div> Keywords: Causality, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, Causal Process, Transformer Networks 

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Causal Process for dynamic causal structure representation in neural networks. It proposes the Causal Process Model to implement this framework and incorporates it into deep reinforcement learning settings. The focus is on inferring interpretable causal processes from visual data by formulating causal inference as an RL task nested within the original problem. Using RL agents, causal graph hypotheses are constructed by establishing links between units similar to the Transformer attention mechanism. The approach demonstrates superior performance in causal representation learning and agent performance in an RL environment, effectively recovering graphs of dynamic causal processes. This novel framework bridges the gap between causal concepts and modern deep learning techniques, addressing the limitations of existing static causal graph models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore, we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover graphs of dynamic causal processes.

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.

Summary:<br />
Anomaly detection in complex domains is challenging due to the lack of labeled data and imbalanced samples. Graph-based models integrating attribute and relational data show promise, but sparse anomalous data complicates learning. This study proposes incorporating average controllability of nodes to enhance anomaly detection performance. Two novel approaches are introduced: using average controllability as edge weight and encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Evaluation on real and synthetic networks with six baselines shows improved anomaly identification. The integration of average controllability enhances graph machine learning models' effectiveness in sparse and imbalanced datasets, indicating the significance of controllability measures in anomaly detection. <div>

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2) encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies, highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.

<br /><br />Summary:
This paper presents a study on the training and evaluation of machine learning techniques for classifying cuneiform signs, noting the significant variability in these signs based on origin, purpose, authorship, and digitization method. The research explores how these differences impact ML model performance, aiming to influence future data acquisition standards in this field. The model, based on ResNet50, was trained and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian texts from three Mesopotamian cities, achieving a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for signs with at least 20 instances. These results mark the first automatic classification of Old Babylonian texts, providing a foundation for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities (Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.

<div> Keywords: neuroimaging, structural connectome, harmonization, deep learning, multi-site studies<br />
Summary:<br />
Small sample sizes in neuroimaging, especially in structural connectome (SC) studies, limit the development of reliable biomarkers for disorders like Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. Large-scale multi-site studies have biases due to scanner heterogeneity. Existing SC harmonization methods rely on metadata or traveling subjects and overlook graph topology. A new site-conditioned deep harmonization framework is proposed to harmonize SCs across diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or traveling subjects. Three deep architectures are tested against a linear regression baseline, with the graph convolutional autoencoder demonstrating superior preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality. While the linear regression baseline achieves high numerical performance, it lacks applicability to real-world multi-site studies due to unavailable metadata. The study highlights the importance of model architecture in SC harmonization and shows that graph-based approaches are well-suited for domain-generalizable SC harmonization in large-scale multi-site studies. <div>

Abstract: Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome (SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods - such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in large-scale multi-site SC studies.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for time series forecasting, combining the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. It challenges the traditional equal weighting of long-term and short-term dependencies, proposing a dynamic weighting mechanism called ParallelTime Weighter. This mechanism calculates interdependent weights for each token based on input and model knowledge. The newly proposed ParallelTime architecture integrates the ParallelTime Weighter to achieve state-of-the-art performance, scalability to longer horizons, and outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs and parameter requirements. The research shows promising advancements in parallel Attention-Mamba for time series forecasting. The implementation is readily available on GitHub for further exploration and development.

arXiv:2507.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting.

<div> Dual formulation, dynamic programming, CVaR-optimal policies, Markov Decision Processes, risk-assignment consistency constraints<br />
Summary:<br />
This article explores the challenges in evaluating static CVaR of policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The authors reveal that the evaluation process involves solving two distinct minimization problems and highlight the importance of satisfying "risk-assignment consistency constraints" for accurate evaluation. The study uncovers that evaluation errors arise when these constraints' intersection is empty, causing a CVaR evaluation gap. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that the issues in optimizing via dual-based CVaR DP stem from returning policies with non-zero evaluation gaps. Furthermore, the article establishes the fundamental limitation in finding a single universally optimal policy using the dual CVaR decomposition approach, exemplified by an MDP where no single policy can be optimal for all initial risk levels. <div>
arXiv:2507.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods for finding static CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can fail when based on the dual formulation, yet the root cause for the failure has remained unclear. We expand on these findings by shifting focus from policy optimization to the seemingly simpler task of policy evaluation. We show that evaluating the static CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization problems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency constraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of the constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation errors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then demonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR DP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap. We then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the search for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR decomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single policy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.

<div> Gaussian process regression, Byzantine-resilient, federated online learning, cloud, agents<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper presents a study on Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). A new algorithm is developed to enable collaboration between a cloud and a group of agents in learning a latent function and improving performance even in the presence of Byzantine failures. The algorithm involves agents sending potentially compromised local predictions to the cloud, which then computes a global model using a Byzantine-resilient aggregation rule. The global model is broadcasted back to all agents, who refine their local predictions by fusing the global model with their own. The accuracy improvements of this fused approach over local GPR are quantified. Experimental results on toy examples and real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR. Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

Summary: 
Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are crucial for studying nanoscale structural properties of materials. However, real-time analysis can be challenging due to artifacts and computational demands. A new physics-aware neural network, DONUT, has been introduced to automate the analysis of nanobeam diffraction data in scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy. DONUT incorporates a diffraction model into its architecture to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation without labeled datasets or pre-training. Experimental results show that DONUT efficiently extracts features from data over 200 times faster than conventional methods. This advancement in automated analysis will greatly benefit researchers in the field of X-ray science.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are critical for investigating the fundamental structural properties of materials at the nanoscale. While advancements have made these experiments more accessible, real-time analysis remains a significant bottleneck, often hindered by artifacts and computational demands. In scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy, which is widely used to spatially resolve structural heterogeneities, this challenge is compounded by the convolution of the divergent beam with the sample's local structure. To address this, we introduce DONUT (Diffraction with Optics for Nanobeam by Unsupervised Training), a physics-aware neural network designed for the rapid and automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data. By incorporating a differentiable geometric diffraction model directly into its architecture, DONUT learns to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation in real-time. Crucially, this is achieved without reliance on labeled datasets or pre-training, overcoming a fundamental limitation for supervised machine learning in X-ray science. We demonstrate experimentally that DONUT accurately extracts all features within the data over 200 times more efficiently than conventional fitting methods.

<div> Keywords: continual learning, stability gap, plasticity, retention, gain modulation

Summary:
This study investigates the stability gap observed in continual learning, where a drop in performance on mastered tasks occurs when learning new ones. The research examines this gap within an ideal joint training context to isolate its causes. The imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries is identified as a key factor contributing to the stability gap. Inspired by biological mechanisms, the study introduces uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics to address this issue by approximating a two-timescale optimizer. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks show that this mechanism effectively reduces the stability gap and enhances performance in continual learning tasks. The analysis also highlights how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering insights into mechanisms to improve learning retention and mitigate forgetting in artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

<div> Keywords: Multi-objective reinforcement learning, Preferences, Pareto frontier, Policy optimization, Real-world applications

Summary:<br />
Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach that optimizes tasks with multiple objectives but can be challenging due to pre-defined reward functions. This paper introduces Preference-based MORL (Pb-MORL), which integrates preferences into the MORL framework, providing a more flexible and intuitive decision-making process. The method constructs a multi-objective reward model aligning with preferences, eliminating the need for complicated reward design. The theoretical proof shows that optimizing this reward model is equivalent to training a Pareto optimal policy. Experiments in benchmark tasks and real-world scenarios demonstrate the method's competitiveness, even outperforming the oracle method using ground truth reward functions. This suggests the potential of Pb-MORL for practical applications in complex systems.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL (Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task, and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications in complex real-world systems.

Abstract: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM) module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

<title>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) for Imbalanced Data -- An Empirical Perspective</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However, conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains. Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs. These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning, optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations.

Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the case of growing rank.

Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network (NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset (in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy, respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to 6003x lower training times compared to SVM and NN-models, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for hardware design automation, particularly through Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. In this work, we examine the current literature on RTL generation using LLMs and identify key requirements for training and fine-tuning datasets. We construct a robust Verilog dataset through an automated three-pronged process involving database (DB) creation and management with PostgreSQL, data collection from code hosting sites like OpenCores and GitHub, and data preprocessing to verify the codes' syntax, run logic synthesis, and extract relevant module metadata. We implement a scalable and efficient DB infrastructure to support analysis and detail our preprocessing pipeline to enforce high-quality data before DB insertion. The resulting dataset comprises 20,392 Verilog samples, 751 MB of Verilog code data, which is the largest high-quality Verilog dataset for LLM fine-tuning to our knowledge. We further evaluate the dataset, address associated challenges, and explore potential applications for future research and development in LLM-based hardware generation.

Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning. Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and structural health management in composite aerostructures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for bridging structured data and language models.

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19 related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD) algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established norms.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data. A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery (SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work, we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible generative models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a 2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English, constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a robust baseline for India-centric applications.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion (MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose, in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature, and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400 minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be available upon request to the corresponding author.

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs, with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question pairs in crowded scenes.

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising. First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest (confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation, and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or machine learning knowledge.

<title>Graph Neural Network Surrogates for Contacting Deformable Bodies with Necessary and Sufficient Contact Detection</title>

Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.

Abstract: Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness, energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale. We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in the same network.

Abstract: Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic, thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data has proven effective for agricultural tasks due to its rich spectral and temporal nature. In this study, we tackle the task of stress detection in sugar-beet fields using a fully unsupervised approach. We propose a 3D convolutional autoencoder model to extract meaningful features from Sentinel-2 image sequences, combined with acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing client data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains. While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving large datasets and strict compliance requirements.
  We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to 95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and efficiency at scale.

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial fine-tuning attacks.

Abstract: In this work we extend the low-cost GELLO teleoperation system, initially designed for joint position control, with additional force information. Our first extension is to implement force feedback, allowing users to feel resistance when interacting with the environment. Our second extension is to add force information into the data collection process and training of imitation learning models. We validate our additions by implementing these on a GELLO system with a Franka Panda arm as the follower robot, performing a user study, and comparing the performance of policies trained with and without force information on a range of simulated and real dexterous manipulation tasks. Qualitatively, users with robotics experience preferred our controller, and the addition of force inputs improved task success on the majority of tasks.

Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and a mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements combine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a framework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential equations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the biophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead to emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this framework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal state transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural representations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that these cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational dynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism unifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and oscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we show that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative tasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for performing complex cognitive tasks. Our findings position SSMs as a compelling framework that connects single-neuron dynamics to cognitive phenomena, offering a unifying and computationally tractable theoretical ground for temporal learning in the brain.

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual kernel bandits with stochastic contexts, where the underlying reward function belongs to a known Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We study this problem under an additional constraint of Differential Privacy, where the agent needs to ensure that the sequence of query points is differentially private with respect to both the sequence of contexts and rewards. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves the state-of-the-art cumulative regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T\sqrt{T}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$ over a time horizon of $T$ in the joint and local models of differential privacy, respectively, where $\gamma_T$ is the effective dimension of the kernel and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}} > 0$ is the privacy parameter. The key ingredient of the proposed algorithm is a novel private kernel-ridge regression estimator which is based on a combination of private covariance estimation and private random projections. It offers a significantly reduced sensitivity compared to its classical counterpart while maintaining a high prediction accuracy, allowing our algorithm to achieve the state-of-the-art performance guarantees.

<title>When Person Re-Identification Meets Event Camera: A Benchmark Dataset and An Attribute-guided Re-Identification Framework</title>

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework. The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID

<title>HeCoFuse: Cross-Modal Complementary V2X Cooperative Perception with Heterogeneous Sensors</title>

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras (C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22% 3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust performance across diverse sensor deployments.

<title>Tight Bounds for Answering Adaptively Chosen Concentrated Queries</title>

Abstract: Most work on adaptive data analysis assumes that samples in the dataset are independent. When correlations are allowed, even the non-adaptive setting can become intractable, unless some structural constraints are imposed. To address this, Bassily and Freund [2016] introduced the elegant framework of concentrated queries, which requires the analyst to restrict itself to queries that are concentrated around their expected value. While this assumption makes the problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it remains quite challenging. In fact, all known algorithms in this framework support significantly fewer queries than in the independent case: At most $O(n)$ queries for a sample of size $n$, compared to $O(n^2)$ in the independent setting.
  In this work, we prove that this utility gap is inherent under the current formulation of the concentrated queries framework, assuming some natural conditions on the algorithm. Additionally, we present a simplified version of the best-known algorithms that match our impossibility result.

<title>CogniQ-H: A Soft Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Paradigm for Automated Data Preparation</title>

Abstract: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior, generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive, evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to 13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.

Abstract: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy (Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.3$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency through selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\% of total exploration steps).

<title>Tackling fake images in cybersecurity -- Interpretation of a StyleGAN and lifting its black-box</title>

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework, enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context of digital deception and cybercrime.

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made available.

<title>Feature Engineering is Not Dead: Reviving Classical Machine Learning with Entropy, HOG, and LBP Feature Fusion for Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image classification and computer vision.

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research, scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Abstract: The amount of quality data in many machine learning tasks is limited to what is available locally to data owners. The set of quality data can be expanded through trading or sharing with external data agents. However, data buyers need quality guarantees before purchasing, as external data may be contaminated or irrelevant to their specific learning task. Previous works primarily rely on distributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality checks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose a distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies external data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization. To achieve this, we introduce novel two-sample testing procedures, grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations for conformal outlier detection, to determine whether an agent's data exceeds a contamination threshold. The proposed tests, termed conformal data contamination tests, remain valid under arbitrary contamination levels while enabling false discovery rate control via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Empirical evaluations across diverse collaborative learning scenarios demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach. Overall, the conformal data contamination test distinguishes itself as a generic procedure for aggregating data with statistically rigorous quality guarantees.

Abstract: Synthesising safe controllers from visual data typically requires extensive supervised labelling of safety-critical data, which is often impractical in real-world settings. Recent advances in world models enable reliable prediction in latent spaces, opening new avenues for scalable and data-efficient safe control. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised framework that leverages control barrier certificates (CBCs) learned in the latent space of a world model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data, while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent dynamics modelling.

Abstract: It is a standard assumption that datasets in high dimension have an internal structure which means that they in fact lie on, or near, subsets of a lower dimension. In many instances it is important to understand the real dimension of the data, hence the complexity of the dataset at hand. A great variety of dimension estimators have been developed to find the intrinsic dimension of the data but there is little guidance on how to reliably use these estimators.
  This survey reviews a wide range of dimension estimation methods, categorising them by the geometric information they exploit: tangential estimators which detect a local affine structure; parametric estimators which rely on dimension-dependent probability distributions; and estimators which use topological or metric invariants.
  The paper evaluates the performance of these methods, as well as investigating varying responses to curvature and noise. Key issues addressed include robustness to hyperparameter selection, sample size requirements, accuracy in high dimensions, precision, and performance on non-linear geometries. In identifying the best hyperparameters for benchmark datasets, overfitting is frequent, indicating that many estimators may not generalise well beyond the datasets on which they have been tested.

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec (Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4% improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC, based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation, for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other classification applications in different areas.

Abstract: Regression problems with bounded continuous outcomes frequently arise in real-world statistical and machine learning applications, such as the analysis of rates and proportions. A central challenge in this setting is predicting a response associated with a new covariate value. Most of the existing statistical and machine learning literature has focused either on point prediction of bounded outcomes or on interval prediction based on asymptotic approximations. We develop conformal prediction intervals for bounded outcomes based on transformation models and beta regression. We introduce tailored non-conformity measures based on residuals that are aligned with the underlying models, and account for the inherent heteroscedasticity in regression settings with bounded outcomes. We present a theoretical result on asymptotic marginal and conditional validity in the context of full conformal prediction, which remains valid under model misspecification. For split conformal prediction, we provide an empirical coverage analysis based on a comprehensive simulation study. The simulation study demonstrates that both methods provide valid finite-sample predictive coverage, including settings with model misspecification. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed conformal prediction intervals on real data and compare them with bootstrap-based alternatives.

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here, we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network (QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced robustness to noise.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT) reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster), highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.

Abstract: We develop a semi-amortized, policy-based, approach to Bayesian experimental design (BED) called Stepwise Deep Adaptive Design (Step-DAD). Like existing, fully amortized, policy-based BED approaches, Step-DAD trains a design policy upfront before the experiment. However, rather than keeping this policy fixed, Step-DAD periodically updates it as data is gathered, refining it to the particular experimental instance. This test-time adaptation improves both the flexibility and the robustness of the design strategy compared with existing approaches. Empirically, Step-DAD consistently demonstrates superior decision-making and robustness compared with current state-of-the-art BED methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are a critical part of state-of-the-art digital health technology for diabetes management. Yet, access to large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of robust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible, and robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 - 2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust AI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain. We provide direct links to each longitudinal diabetes dataset in the Glucose-ML collection and openly provide our code.

<title>DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14079</link>

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on 103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of 3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59). These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres, suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive learning pipeline is implemented.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence thresholds.

<title>CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2507.14111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM executions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction, edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our experiments.

Abstract: Accurate sound source localization (SSL), such as direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, relies on consistent multichannel data. However, batteryless systems often suffer from missing data due to the stochastic nature of energy harvesting, degrading localization performance. We propose LOCUS, a deep learning framework that recovers corrupted features in such settings. LOCUS integrates three modules: (1) Information-Weighted Focus (InFo) to identify corrupted regions, (2) Latent Feature Synthesizer (LaFS) to reconstruct missing features, and (3) Guided Replacement (GRep) to restore data without altering valid inputs. LOCUS significantly improves DoA accuracy under missing-channel conditions, achieving up to 36.91% error reduction on DCASE and LargeSet, and 25.87-59.46% gains in real-world deployments. We release a 50-hour multichannel dataset to support future research on localization under energy constraints. Our code and data are available at: https://bashlab.github.io/locus_project/

Abstract: Over the past decade, neural network (NN)-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a variety of decision-making tasks. However, their black-box nature and the risk of unexpected behaviors pose a challenge to their deployment in real-world systems requiring strong guarantees of correctness and safety. We address these limitations by investigating the transformation of NN-based controllers into equivalent soft decision tree (SDT)-based controllers and its impact on verifiability. In contrast to existing work, we focus on discrete-output NN controllers including rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions as well as argmax operations. We then devise an exact yet efficient transformation algorithm which automatically prunes redundant branches. We first demonstrate the practical efficacy of the transformation algorithm applied to an autonomous driving NN controller within OpenAI Gym's CarRacing environment. Subsequently, we evaluate our approach using two benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym environment. Our results indicate that the SDT transformation can benefit formal verification, showing runtime improvements of up to $21 \times$ and $2 \times$ for MountainCar-v0 and CartPole-v1, respectively.

Abstract: Imitation learning methods have demonstrated considerable success in teaching autonomous systems complex tasks through expert demonstrations. However, a limitation of these methods is their lack of interpretability, particularly in understanding the specific task the learning agent aims to accomplish. In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning method that combines Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference and control synthesis, enabling the explicit representation of the task as an STL formula. This approach not only provides a clear understanding of the task but also supports the integration of human knowledge and allows for adaptation to out-of-distribution scenarios by manually adjusting the STL formulas and fine-tuning the policy. We employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-inspired approach to train both the inference and policy networks, effectively narrowing the gap between expert and learned policies. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated through simulations, showcasing its practical applicability and adaptability.

Abstract: Geometry is a ubiquitous tool in computer graphics, design, and engineering. However, the lack of large shape datasets limits the application of state-of-the-art supervised learning methods and motivates the exploration of alternative learning strategies. To this end, we introduce geometry-informed neural networks (GINNs) -- a framework for training shape-generative neural fields without data by leveraging user-specified design requirements in the form of objectives and constraints. By adding diversity as an explicit constraint, GINNs avoid mode-collapse and can generate multiple diverse solutions, often required in geometry tasks. Experimentally, we apply GINNs to several problems spanning physics, geometry, and engineering design, showing control over geometrical and topological properties, such as surface smoothness or the number of holes. These results demonstrate the potential of training shape-generative models without data, paving the way for new generative design approaches without large datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI (XAI) methods have facilitated profound validation and knowledge extraction from ML models. While extensively studied for classification, few XAI solutions have addressed the challenges specific to regression models. In regression, explanations need to be precisely formulated to address specific user queries (e.g.\ distinguishing between `Why is the output above 0?' and `Why is the output above 50?'). They should furthermore reflect the model's behavior on the relevant data sub-manifold. In this paper, we introduce XpertAI, a framework that disentangles the prediction strategy into multiple range-specific sub-strategies and allows the formulation of precise queries about the model (the `explanandum') as a linear combination of those sub-strategies. XpertAI is formulated generally to work alongside popular XAI attribution techniques, based on occlusion, gradient integration, or reverse propagation. Qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrate the benefits of our approach.

Abstract: The lack of transparency of Deep Neural Networks continues to be a limitation that severely undermines their reliability and usage in high-stakes applications. Promising approaches to overcome such limitations are Prototype-Based Self-Explainable Neural Networks (PSENNs), whose predictions rely on the similarity between the input at hand and a set of prototypical representations of the output classes, offering therefore a deep, yet transparent-by-design, architecture. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic reformulation of PSENNs, called Prob-PSENN, which replaces point estimates for the prototypes with probability distributions over their values. This provides not only a more flexible framework for an end-to-end learning of prototypes, but can also capture the explanatory uncertainty of the model, which is a missing feature in previous approaches. In addition, since the prototypes determine both the explanation and the prediction, Prob-PSENNs allow us to detect when the model is making uninformed or uncertain predictions, and to obtain valid explanations for them. Our experiments demonstrate that Prob-PSENNs provide more meaningful and robust explanations than their non-probabilistic counterparts, while remaining competitive in terms of predictive performance, thus enhancing the explainability and reliability of the models.

Abstract: We consider the verification of neural network policies for discrete-time stochastic systems with respect to reach-avoid specifications. We use a learner-verifier procedure that learns a certificate for the specification, represented as a neural network. Verifying that this neural network certificate is a so-called reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM) proves the satisfaction of a reach-avoid specification. Existing approaches for such a verification task rely on computed Lipschitz constants of neural networks. These approaches struggle with large Lipschitz constants, especially for reach-avoid specifications with high threshold probabilities. We present two key contributions to obtain smaller Lipschitz constants than existing approaches. First, we introduce logarithmic RASMs (logRASMs), which take exponentially smaller values than RASMs and hence have lower theoretical Lipschitz constants. Second, we present a fast method to compute tighter upper bounds on Lipschitz constants based on weighted norms. Our empirical evaluation shows we can consistently verify the satisfaction of reach-avoid specifications with probabilities as high as 99.9999%.

Abstract: Training deep learning models is a repetitive and resource-intensive process. Data scientists often train several models before landing on a set of parameters (e.g., hyper-parameter tuning) and model architecture (e.g., neural architecture search), among other things that yield the highest accuracy. The computational efficiency of these training tasks depends highly on how well the training data is supplied to the training process. The repetitive nature of these tasks results in the same data processing pipelines running over and over, exacerbating the need for and costs of computational resources. In this paper, we present TensorSocket to reduce the computational needs of deep learning training by enabling simultaneous training processes to share the same data loader. TensorSocket mitigates CPU-side bottlenecks in cases where the collocated training workloads have high throughput on GPU, but are held back by lower data-loading throughput on CPU. TensorSocket achieves this by reducing redundant computations and data duplication across collocated training processes and leveraging modern GPU-GPU interconnects. While doing so, TensorSocket is able to train and balance differently-sized models and serve multiple batch sizes simultaneously and is hardware- and pipeline-agnostic in nature. Our evaluation shows that TensorSocket enables scenarios that are infeasible without data sharing, increases training throughput by up to 100%, and when utilizing cloud instances, achieves cost savings of 50% by reducing the hardware resource needs on the CPU side. Furthermore, TensorSocket outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions for shared data loading such as CoorDL and Joader; it is easier to deploy and maintain and either achieves higher or matches their throughput while requiring fewer CPU resources.

<title>On Logical Extrapolation for Mazes with Recurrent and Implicit Networks</title>

Abstract: Recent work suggests that certain neural network architectures -- particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and implicit neural networks (INNs) -- are capable of logical extrapolation. When trained on easy instances of a task, these networks (henceforth: logical extrapolators) can generalize to more difficult instances. Previous research has hypothesized that logical extrapolators do so by learning a scalable, iterative algorithm for the given task which converges to the solution. We examine this idea more closely in the context of a single task: maze solving. By varying test data along multiple axes -- not just maze size -- we show that models introduced in prior work fail in a variety of ways, some expected and others less so. It remains uncertain whether any of these models has truly learned an algorithm. However, we provide evidence that a certain RNN has approximately learned a form of `deadend-filling'. We show that training these models on more diverse data addresses some failure modes but, paradoxically, does not improve logical extrapolation. We also analyze convergence behavior, and show that models explicitly trained to converge to a fixed point are likely to do so when extrapolating, while models that are not may exhibit more exotic limiting behavior such as limit cycles, even when they correctly solve the problem. Our results (i) show that logical extrapolation is not immune to the problem of goal misgeneralization, and (ii) suggest that analyzing the dynamics of extrapolation may yield insights into designing better logical extrapolators.

Abstract: Although AlphaZero has achieved superhuman performance in board games, recent studies reveal its limitations in handling scenarios requiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire board, such as recognizing long-sequence patterns in Go. To address this challenge, we propose ResTNet, a network that interleaves residual and Transformer blocks to bridge local and global knowledge. ResTNet improves playing strength across multiple board games, increasing win rate from 54.6% to 60.8% in 9x9 Go, 53.6% to 60.9% in 19x19 Go, and 50.4% to 58.0% in 19x19 Hex. In addition, ResTNet effectively processes global information and tackles two long-sequence patterns in 19x19 Go, including circular pattern and ladder pattern. It reduces the mean square error for circular pattern recognition from 2.58 to 1.07 and lowers the attack probability against an adversary program from 70.44% to 23.91%. ResTNet also improves ladder pattern recognition accuracy from 59.15% to 80.01%. By visualizing attention maps, we demonstrate that ResTNet captures critical game concepts in both Go and Hex, offering insights into AlphaZero's decision-making process. Overall, ResTNet shows a promising approach to integrating local and global knowledge, paving the way for more effective AlphaZero-based algorithms in board games.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is to make a well-trained model behave as if it had never been trained on specific data. In today's over-parameterized models, dominated by neural networks, a common approach is to manually relabel data and fine-tune the well-trained model. It can approximate the MU model in the output space, but the question remains whether it can achieve exact MU, i.e., in the parameter space. We answer this question by employing random feature techniques to construct an analytical framework. Under the premise of model optimization via stochastic gradient descent, we theoretically demonstrated that over-parameterized linear models can achieve exact MU through relabeling specific data. We also extend this work to real-world nonlinear networks and propose an alternating optimization algorithm that unifies the tasks of unlearning and relabeling. The algorithm's effectiveness, confirmed through numerical experiments, highlights its superior performance in unlearning across various scenarios compared to current state-of-the-art methods, particularly excelling over similar relabeling-based MU approaches.

Abstract: Molecular deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in property prediction, but they often require large amounts of labeled data. The challenge is that, in real-world applications, labels are extremely scarce, as obtaining them through laboratory experimentation is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained molecular model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated labels are scarce. MoleVers employs a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, it learns molecular representations from unlabeled data through masked atom prediction and extreme denoising, a novel task enabled by our newly introduced branching encoder architecture and dynamic noise scale sampling. In the second stage, the model refines these representations through predictions of auxiliary properties derived from computational methods, such as the density functional theory or large language models. Evaluation on 22 small, experimentally-validated datasets demonstrates that MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of its two-stage framework in producing generalizable molecular representations for diverse downstream properties.

Abstract: This paper presents Variables Adaptive Mixture of Experts (VAMoE), a novel framework for incremental weather forecasting that dynamically adapts to evolving spatiotemporal patterns in real time data. Traditional weather prediction models often struggle with exorbitant computational expenditure and the need to continuously update forecasts as new observations arrive. VAMoE addresses these challenges by leveraging a hybrid architecture of experts, where each expert specializes in capturing distinct subpatterns of atmospheric variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed). Moreover, the proposed method employs a variable adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically select and combine relevant experts based on the input context, enabling efficient knowledge distillation and parameter sharing. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high forecast accuracy. Experiments on real world ERA5 dataset demonstrate that VAMoE performs comparable against SoTA models in both short term (1 days) and long term (5 days) forecasting tasks, with only about 25% of trainable parameters and 50% of the initial training data.

Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly how they evolve low-dimensional features from high-dimensional data, remains a central challenge in deep learning theory. In this work, we introduce the concept of $\epsilon$-rank, a novel metric quantifying the effective feature of neuron functions in the terminal hidden layer. Through extensive experiments across diverse tasks, we observe a universal staircase phenomenon: during training process implemented by the standard stochastic gradient descent methods, the decline of the loss function is accompanied by an increase in the $\epsilon$-rank and exhibits a staircase pattern. Theoretically, we rigorously prove a negative correlation between the loss lower bound and $\epsilon$-rank, demonstrating that a high $\epsilon$-rank is essential for significant loss reduction. Moreover, numerical evidences show that within the same deep neural network, the $\epsilon$-rank of the subsequent hidden layer is higher than that of the previous hidden layer. Based on these observations, to eliminate the staircase phenomenon, we propose a novel pre-training strategy on the initial hidden layer that elevates the $\epsilon$-rank of the terminal hidden layer. Numerical experiments validate its effectiveness in reducing training time and improving accuracy across various tasks. Therefore, the newly introduced concept of $\epsilon$-rank is a computable quantity that serves as an intrinsic effective metric characteristic for deep neural networks, providing a novel perspective for understanding the training dynamics of neural networks and offering a theoretical foundation for designing efficient training strategies in practical applications.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful approach to extract semantically meaningful concepts from the internals of large language models (LLMs) trained mainly in the text domain. In this work, we explore whether DL can extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data, such as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where limited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We propose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from control data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve biologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes arising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new direction for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in bioimaging.

Abstract: The energy efficiency of deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) aligns with the constraints of resource-limited edge devices, positioning SNNs as a promising foundation for intelligent applications leveraging the extensive data collected by these devices. To address data privacy concerns when deploying SNNs on edge devices, federated learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training by leveraging data distributed across edge devices without transmitting local data to a central server. However, existing FL approaches struggle with label-skewed data across devices, which leads to drift in local SNN models and degrades the performance of the global SNN model. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FedLEC, which incorporates intra-client label weight calibration to balance the learning intensity across local labels and inter-client knowledge distillation to mitigate local SNN model bias caused by label absence. Extensive experiments with three different structured SNNs across five datasets (i.e., three non-neuromorphic and two neuromorphic datasets) demonstrate the efficiency of FedLEC. Compared to eight state-of-the-art FL algorithms, FedLEC achieves an average accuracy improvement of approximately 11.59% for the global SNN model under various label skew distribution settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in archaeology have increased significantly in recent years, and these now span all subfields, geographical regions, and time periods. The prevalence and success of these applications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of machine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of archaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published between 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning models are gaining in popularity they remain subject to misunderstanding. We observed, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning applications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly expressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to develop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research questions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is rapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice, useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without limitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined and well-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximise the potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology.

<title>Load Forecasting for Households and Energy Communities: Are Deep Learning Models Worth the Effort?</title>

Abstract: Energy communities (ECs) play a key role in enabling local demand shifting and enhancing self-sufficiency, as energy systems transition toward decentralized structures with high shares of renewable generation. To optimally operate them, accurate short-term load forecasting is essential, particularly for implementing demand-side management strategies. With the recent rise of deep learning methods, data-driven forecasting has gained significant attention, however, it remains insufficiently explored in many practical contexts. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning models-including LSTM, xLSTM, and Transformer architectures-compared to traditional benchmarks such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and persistence forecasting, across varying community size, historical data availability, and model complexity. Additionally, we assess the benefits of transfer learning using publicly available synthetic load profiles. On average, transfer learning improves the normalized mean absolute error by 1.97 percentage points when only two months of training data are available. Interestingly, for less than six months of training data, simple persistence models outperform deep learning architectures in forecast accuracy. The practical value of improved forecasting is demonstrated using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization for ECs with a shared battery energy storage system. For an energy community with 50 households, the most accurate deep learning model achieves an average reduction in financial energy costs of 8.06%. Notably, a simple KNN approach achieves average savings of 8.01%, making it a competitive and robust alternative. All implementations are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. These findings offer actionable insights for ECs, and they highlight when the additional complexity of deep learning is warranted by performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiZO-E86D.

Abstract: Anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is an important research problem and receives more and more attention recently. Untrained anomaly detection based on only one sample is an emerging research problem motivated by real manufacturing industries such as personalized manufacturing where only one sample can be collected without any additional labels and historical datasets. Identifying anomalies accurately based on one 3D point cloud sample is a critical challenge in both industrial applications and the field of machine learning. This paper aims to provide a formal definition of the untrained anomaly detection problem based on 3D point cloud data, discuss the differences between untrained anomaly detection and current unsupervised anomaly detection problems. Unlike trained unsupervised learning, untrained unsupervised learning does not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage prior knowledge about the surfaces and anomalies.
  We propose three complementary methodological frameworks: the Latent Variable Inference Framework that employs probabilistic modeling to distinguish anomalies; the Decomposition Framework that separates point clouds into reference, anomaly, and noise components through sparse learning; and the Local Geometry Framework that leverages neighborhood information for anomaly identification. Experimental results demonstrate that untrained methods achieve competitive detection performance while offering significant computational advantages, demonstrating up to a 15-fold increase in execution speed. The proposed methods provide viable solutions for scenarios with extreme data scarcity, addressing critical challenges in personalized manufacturing and healthcare applications where collecting multiple samples or historical data is infeasible.

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as the dominant paradigm for adapting large, pre-trained transformer-based models to downstream tasks. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables large-scale, multi-task offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training by leveraging stochastic trajectory prompts to identify the target task. However, these prompts are sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations, overlooking a critical limitation: not all prompts are equally informative for differentiating between tasks. This limits generalization and adaptation, especially in low-data or open-world settings where sample efficiency is crucial. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, inference-time, bandit-based prompt-tuning framework. The bandit explores and optimizes trajectory prompt selection to enhance task performance, while avoiding costly fine-tuning of the transformer backbone. Our experiments indicate not only clear performance gains due to bandit-based prompt-tuning, but also better sample complexity, scalability, and prompt space exploration compared to prompt-tuning baselines. These results highlights the importance of adaptive prompt selection mechanisms for efficient generalization in offline multi-task RL.

Abstract: Logic synthesis, a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA), optimizes gate-level circuits to minimize power consumption and area occupancy in integrated circuits (ICs). Traditional logic synthesis tools rely on human-designed heuristics, often yielding suboptimal results. Although differentiable architecture search (DAS) has shown promise in generating circuits from truth tables, it faces challenges such as high computational complexity, convergence to local optima, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. Consequently, we propose a novel approach integrating conditional generative models with DAS for circuit generation. Our approach first introduces CircuitVQ, a circuit tokenizer trained based on our Circuit AutoEncoder We then develop CircuitAR, a masked autoregressive model leveraging CircuitVQ as the tokenizer. CircuitAR can generate preliminary circuit structures from truth tables, which guide DAS in producing functionally equivalent circuits. Notably, we observe the scalability and emergent capability in generating complex circuit structures of our CircuitAR models. Extensive experiments also show the superior performance of our method. This research bridges the gap between probabilistic generative models and precise circuit generation, offering a robust solution for logic synthesis.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: While hyperbolic GNNs show promise for hierarchical data, they often have limited discriminative power compared to Euclidean counterparts or the WL test, due to non-injective aggregation. To address this expressivity gap, we propose the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel HGNN designed for enhanced discrimination within the Lorentzian model. LGIN introduces a new update rule that preserves the Lorentzian metric while effectively capturing richer structural information. This marks a significant step towards more expressive GNNs on Riemannian manifolds. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate LGIN's superior performance, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean baselines, showcasing its ability to capture complex graph structures. LGIN is the first to adapt principles of powerful, highly discriminative GNN architectures to a Riemannian manifold. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN

Abstract: In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model can be adapted to different target properties, enabling systematic exploration of large chemical spaces relevant to fuel design applications. Furthermore, the demonstrated framework can be readily extended by incorporating additional synthesizability criteria to improve applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

Building upon established next-token prediction approaches, we aim to address potential challenges such as resolution loss from existing tokenization schemes and limited support for conditional generation. We propose four key innovations: (i) separate vocabularies for discrete and continuous variates, combined via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic conditioning through prepended context embeddings, (iii) scalable and simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint vocabulary inflation, and (iv) class conditional generation through a Mixture of Experts. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction tasks such as pion/kaon identification, and noise filtering, in which we show its ability to leverage fine-tuning under specific objectives.

Abstract: Recalibration of binary probabilistic classifiers to a target prior probability is an important task in areas like credit risk management. We analyse methods for recalibration from a distribution shift perspective. Distribution shift assumptions linked to the area under the curve (AUC) of a probabilistic classifier are found to be useful for the design of meaningful recalibration methods. Two new methods called parametric covariate shift with posterior drift (CSPD) and ROC-based quasi moment matching (QMM) are proposed and tested together with some other methods in an example setting. The outcomes of the test suggest that the QMM methods discussed in the paper can provide appropriately conservative results in evaluations with concave functionals like for instance risk weights functions for credit risk.

<title>FireQ: Fast INT4-FP8 Kernel and RoPE-aware Quantization for LLM Inference Acceleration</title>

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its gradient-based variants (e.g., GradCAM) have become standard tools for explaining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predictions. However, these approaches typically focus on individual logits, while for neural networks using softmax, the class membership probability estimates depend \textit{only} on the \textit{differences} between logits, not on their absolute values. This disconnect leaves standard CAMs vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, such as passive fooling, where a model is trained to produce misleading CAMs without affecting decision performance. We introduce \textbf{Salience-Hoax Activation Maps (SHAMs)}, an \emph{entropy-aware form of passive fooling} that serves as a benchmark for CAM robustness under adversarial conditions. To address the passive fooling vulnerability, we then propose \textbf{DiffGradCAM}, a novel, lightweight, and contrastive approach to class activation mapping that is both non-suceptible to passive fooling, but also matches the output of standard CAM methods such as GradCAM in the non-adversarial case. Together, SHAM and DiffGradCAM establish a new framework for probing and improving the robustness of saliency-based explanations. We validate both contributions across multi-class tasks with few and many classes.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction remains a central challenge in temporal graph learning, particularly in designing models that are both effective and practical for real-world deployment. Existing approaches often rely on complex neural architectures, which are computationally intensive and difficult to interpret.
  In this work, we build on the strong recurrence-based foundation of the EdgeBank baseline, by supplementing it with inductive capabilities. We do so by leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming them on some datasets. Importantly, it considerably improves on existing baselines' performance under more realistic and challenging negative sampling strategies -- offering a simple yet robust alternative for temporal graph learning.

<title>Honesty in Causal Forests: When It Helps and When It Hurts</title>

Abstract: Causal forests estimate how treatment effects vary across individuals, guiding personalized interventions in areas like marketing, operations, and public policy. A standard modeling practice with this method is honest estimation: dividing the data so that the subgroups used to model treatment effect variation are formed separately from the data used to estimate those effects. This is intended to reduce overfitting and is the default in many software packages. But is it always the right choice? In this paper, we show that honest estimation can reduce the accuracy of individual-level treatment effect estimates, especially when there are substantial differences in how individuals respond to treatment, and the data is rich enough to uncover those differences. The core issue is a classic bias-variance trade-off: honesty lowers the risk of overfitting but increases the risk of underfitting, because it limits the data available to detect patterns. Across 7,500 benchmark datasets, we find that the cost of using honesty by default can be as high as requiring 75% more data to match the performance of models trained without it. We argue that honesty is best understood as a form of regularization, and like any regularization choice, its use should be guided by out-of-sample performance, not adopted reflexively.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for drug discovery. While recent deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising results, they often rely solely on structural features of proteins and ligands, overlooking their valuable biochemical knowledge associated with binding affinity. To address this limitation, we propose KEPLA, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly integrates prior knowledge from Gene Ontology and ligand properties to enhance prediction performance. KEPLA takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, interpretability analyses based on knowledge graph relations and cross attention maps provide valuable insights into the underlying predictive mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However, constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower value.

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER) objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to mitigating goal misgeneralization.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.

Abstract: Federated learning aims at training models collaboratively across participants while protecting privacy. However, one major challenge for this paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial components.

Abstract: Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges. Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) robustly reconstructs dynamically varying states from partial and noisy observations, while encoding static and semi-static information, such as radio nodes, cell attributes, and their topology, through graph representations; (ii) applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii) distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five 5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks, respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture, offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.

Abstract: The latest developments in computer hardware, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence can make virtual reality (VR) and virtual spaces an important part of human everyday life. Eye tracking offers not only a hands-free way of interaction but also the possibility of a deeper understanding of human visual attention and cognitive processes in VR. Despite these possibilities, eye-tracking data also reveals users' privacy-sensitive attributes when combined with the information about the presented stimulus. To address all these possibilities and potential privacy issues, in this survey, we first cover major works in eye tracking, VR, and privacy areas between 2012 and 2022. While eye tracking in the VR part covers the complete pipeline of eye-tracking methodology from pupil detection and gaze estimation to offline use of the data and analyses, as for privacy and security, we focus on eye-based authentication as well as computational methods to preserve the privacy of individuals and their eye-tracking data in VR. Later, considering all of these, we draw three main directions for the research community by focusing on privacy challenges. In summary, this survey provides an extensive literature review of the utmost possibilities with eye tracking in VR and the privacy implications of those possibilities.

Abstract: We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ and class-conditional models trained on ImageNet datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel.

Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) for interacting many-electron systems is fundamental to condensed matter physics, yet achieving accurate solutions confronts computational challenges in managing the combinatorial complexity of Feynman diagrams, implementing systematic renormalization, and evaluating high-dimensional integrals. We present a unifying framework that integrates QFT computational workflows with an AI-powered technology stack. A cornerstone of this framework is representing Feynman diagrams as computational graphs, which structures the inherent mathematical complexity and facilitates the application of optimized algorithms developed for machine learning and high-performance computing. Consequently, automatic differentiation, native to these graph representations, delivers efficient, fully automated, high-order field-theoretic renormalization procedures. This graph-centric approach also enables sophisticated numerical integration; our neural-network-enhanced Monte Carlo method, accelerated via massively parallel GPU implementation, efficiently evaluates challenging high-dimensional diagrammatic integrals. Applying this framework to the uniform electron gas, we determine the quasiparticle effective mass to a precision significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art simulations. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating AI-driven computational advances with QFT, opening systematic pathways for solving complex quantum many-body problems across disciplines.

In this work, we present Meta4XNLI, a novel parallel dataset for the tasks of metaphor detection and interpretation that contains metaphor annotations in both Spanish and English. We investigate language models' metaphor identification and understanding abilities through a series of monolingual and cross-lingual experiments by leveraging our proposed corpus. In order to comprehend how these non-literal expressions affect models' performance, we look over the results and perform an error analysis. Additionally, parallel data offers many potential opportunities to investigate metaphor transferability between these languages and the impact of translation on the development of multilingual annotated resources.

Abstract: Optimal transport has been very successful for various machine learning tasks; however, it is known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Hence, dimensionality reduction is desirable when applied to high-dimensional data with low-dimensional structures. The kernel max-sliced (KMS) Wasserstein distance is developed for this purpose by finding an optimal nonlinear mapping that reduces data into $1$ dimension before computing the Wasserstein distance. However, its theoretical properties have not yet been fully developed. In this paper, we provide sharp finite-sample guarantees under milder technical assumptions compared with state-of-the-art for the KMS $p$-Wasserstein distance between two empirical distributions with $n$ samples for general $p\in[1,\infty)$. Algorithm-wise, we show that computing the KMS $2$-Wasserstein distance is NP-hard, and then we further propose a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) formulation (which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time) and provide a relaxation gap for the obtained solution. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the good performance of our scheme for high-dimensional two-sample testing.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.

Abstract: psifx is a plug-and-play multi-modal feature extraction toolkit, aiming to facilitate and democratize the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for human sciences research. It is motivated by a need (a) to automate and standardize data annotation processes that typically require expensive, lengthy, and inconsistent human labour; (b) to develop and distribute open-source community-driven psychology research software; and (c) to enable large-scale access and ease of use for non-expert users. The framework contains an array of tools for tasks such as speaker diarization, closed-caption transcription and translation from audio; body, hand, and facial pose estimation and gaze tracking with multi-person tracking from video; and interactive textual feature extraction supported by large language models. The package has been designed with a modular and task-oriented approach, enabling the community to add or update new tools easily. This combination creates new opportunities for in-depth study of real-time behavioral phenomena in psychological and social science research.

<title>On the optimal approximation of Sobolev and Besov functions using deep ReLU neural networks</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of how efficiently functions in the Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{W}^{s,q}([0,1]^d)$ and Besov spaces $\mathcal{B}^s_{q,r}([0,1]^d)$ can be approximated by deep ReLU neural networks with width $W$ and depth $L$, when the error is measured in the $L^p([0,1]^d)$ norm. This problem has been studied by several recent works, which obtained the approximation rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s/d})$ up to logarithmic factors when $p=q=\infty$, and the rate $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2s/d})$ for networks with fixed width when the Sobolev embedding condition $1/q -1/p<s>d$ holds. We generalize these results by showing that the rate $\mathcal{O}((WL)^{-2s</s>d})$ indeed holds under the Sobolev embedding condition. It is known that this rate is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The key tool in our proof is a novel encoding of sparse vectors by using deep ReLU neural networks with varied width and depth, which may be of independent interest.

<title>An Approach for Auto Generation of Labeling Functions for Software Engineering Chatbots</title>

Abstract: Software engineering (SE) chatbots are increasingly gaining attention for their role in enhancing development processes. At the core of chatbots are Natural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to comprehend user queries but require labeled data for training. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE chatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, as training requires specialized vocabulary and phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, developers often resort to manually annotating user queries -- a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Previous approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling functions (LFs), that categorize queries based on specific patterns. To address this issue, we propose an approach to automatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We evaluate our approach on four SE datasets and measure performance improvement from training NLUs on queries labeled by the generated LFs. The generated LFs effectively label data with AUC scores up to 85.3% and NLU performance improvements up to 27.2%. Furthermore, our results show that the number of LFs affects labeling performance. We believe that our approach can save time and resources in labeling users' queries, allowing practitioners to focus on core chatbot functionalities rather than manually labeling queries.

Abstract: The search for weakly interacting matter particles (WIMPs) is one of the main objectives of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In this work we use Machine-Learning (ML) techniques to explore WIMP radiative decays into a Dark Matter (DM) candidate in a supersymmetric framework. The minimal supersymmetric WIMP sector includes the lightest neutralino that can provide the observed DM relic density through its co-annihilation with the second lightest neutralino and lightest chargino. Moreover, the direct DM detection cross section rates fulfill current experimental bounds and provide discovery targets for the same region of model parameters in which the radiative decay of the second lightest neutralino into a photon and the lightest neutralino is enhanced. This strongly motivates the search for radiatively decaying neutralinos which, however, suffers from strong backgrounds. We investigate the LHC reach in the search for these radiatively decaying particles by means of cut-based and ML methods and estimate its discovery potential in this well-motivated, new physics scenario. We demonstrate that using ML techniques would enable access to most of the parameter space unexplored by other searches.

<title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>

arXiv:2411.02904v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\epsilon_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions about the covariate as long as the covariate is bounded, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions of the covariates such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions on the covariates. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions on the bounded covariate. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning, which learns solely from datasets without environmental interaction, has gained attention. This approach, similar to traditional online deep reinforcement learning, is particularly promising for robot control applications. Nevertheless, its robustness against real-world challenges, such as joint actuator faults in robots, remains a critical concern. This study evaluates the robustness of existing offline reinforcement learning methods using legged robots from OpenAI Gym based on average episodic rewards. For robustness evaluation, we simulate failures by incorporating both random and adversarial perturbations, representing worst-case scenarios, into the joint torque signals. Our experiments show that existing offline reinforcement learning methods exhibit significant vulnerabilities to these action perturbations and are more vulnerable than online reinforcement learning methods, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in this field.

<title>BLAST: A Stealthy Backdoor Leverage Attack against Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning based Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (c-MADRL) is under the threat of backdoor attacks. Once a backdoor trigger is observed, it will perform malicious actions leading to failures or malicious goals. However, existing backdoor attacks suffer from several issues, e.g., instant trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is trained or activated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor leverage attack against c-MADRL, BLAST, which attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only in a single agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior patterns as the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual patterns or instant status and control the period to perform malicious actions. This method can guarantee the stealthiness and practicality of BLAST. Secondly, we hack the original reward function of the backdoor agent via unilateral guidance to inject BLAST, so as to achieve the \textit{leverage attack effect} that can pry open the entire multi-agent system via a single backdoor agent. We evaluate our BLAST against 3 classic c-MADRL algorithms (VDN, QMIX, and MAPPO) in 2 popular c-MADRL environments (SMAC and Pursuit), and 2 existing defense mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that BLAST can achieve a high attack success rate while maintaining a low clean performance variance rate.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2501.17328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of deep learning models in critical domains necessitates a balance between high accuracy and interpretability. We introduce SIC, an inherently interpretable neural network that provides local and global explanations of its decision-making process. Leveraging the concept of case-based reasoning, SIC extracts class-representative support vectors from training images, ensuring they capture relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones. Classification decisions are made by calculating and aggregating similarity scores between these support vectors and the input's latent feature vector. We employ B-Cos transformations, which align model weights with inputs, to yield coherent pixel-level explanations in addition to global explanations of case-based reasoning. We evaluate SIC on three tasks: fine-grained classification on Stanford Dogs and FunnyBirds, multi-label classification on Pascal VOC, and pathology detection on the RSNA dataset. Results indicate that SIC not only achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art black-box and inherently interpretable models but also offers insightful explanations verified through practical evaluation on the FunnyBirds benchmark. Our theoretical analysis proves that these explanations fulfill established axioms for explanations. Our findings underscore SIC's potential for applications where understanding model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.

<title>To Code or not to Code? Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language Models via Expectation-Maximization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00691</link>

arXiv:2502.00691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.
  While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

<title>ParaPO: Aligning Language Models to Reduce Verbatim Reproduction of Pre-training Data</title>

arXiv:2504.14452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) can memorize and reproduce segments from their pretraining data verbatim even in non-adversarial settings, raising concerns about copyright, plagiarism, privacy, and creativity. We introduce Paraphrase Preference Optimization (ParaPO), a post-training method that fine-tunes LMs to reduce unintentional regurgitation while preserving their overall utility. ParaPO trains LMs to prefer paraphrased versions of memorized segments over the original verbatim content from the pretraining data. To maintain the ability to recall famous quotations when appropriate, we develop a variant of ParaPO that uses system prompts to control regurgitation behavior. In our evaluation on Llama3.1-8B, ParaPO consistently reduces regurgitation across all tested datasets (e.g., reducing the regurgitation metric from 17.3 to 12.9 in creative writing), whereas unlearning methods used in prior work to mitigate regurgitation are less effective outside their targeted unlearned domain (from 17.3 to 16.9). When applied to the instruction-tuned Tulu3-8B model, ParaPO with system prompting successfully preserves famous quotation recall while reducing unintentional regurgitation (from 8.7 to 6.3 in creative writing) when prompted not to regurgitate. In contrast, without ParaPO tuning, prompting the model not to regurgitate produces only a marginal reduction (8.7 to 8.4).

<title>Sparsification Under Siege: Defending Against Poisoning Attacks in Communication-Efficient Federated Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.01454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it faces significant challenges in communication efficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. While sparsification techniques mitigate communication overhead by transmitting only critical model parameters, they inadvertently amplify security risks: adversarial clients can exploit sparse updates to evade detection and degrade model performance. Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL communication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities within sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated learning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model update sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in sparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense strategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while maintaining communication efficiency.

Abstract: Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style. Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation, limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.

Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium Propagation - initially developed for energy-based models - to dynamical trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also discussed.

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

<title>The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity</title>

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper focuses on minimizing the worst-class error rate in classification tasks, which is crucial in applications where certain classes should not have significantly higher error rates than others. Instead of aiming for zero worst-class error, the approach aims to bound the error rate using a problem formulation designed to prevent overfitting in Deep Neural Networks. A boosting approach is proposed to ensemble DNNs and correctly bound the worst-class error. The algorithm successfully lowers worst-class test error rates while ensuring generalization and avoiding overfitting to the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in reducing worst-class errors in classification tasks. The code for the algorithm is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of the worst-class error rate, instead of the standard error rate averaged over all classes. For example, a three-class classification task with class-wise error rates of 10%, 10%, and 40% has a worst-class error rate of 40%, whereas the average is 20% under the class-balanced condition. The worst-class error is important in many applications. For example, in a medical image classification task, it would not be acceptable for the malignant tumor class to have a 40% error rate, while the benign and healthy classes have a 10% error rates. To avoid overfitting in worst-class error minimization using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we design a problem formulation for bounding the worst-class error instead of achieving zero worst-class error. Moreover, to correctly bound the worst-class error, we propose a boosting approach which ensembles DNNs. We give training and generalization worst-class-error bound. Experimental results show that the algorithm lowers worst-class test error rates while avoiding overfitting to the training set.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate continued research, we release our model publicly.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, sequential computation, parallelization, complexity theory, AI<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of current machine learning approaches, which heavily rely on parallelization, in addressing inherently serial problems. These problems, such as mathematical reasoning and sequential decision-making, involve dependent computational steps that cannot be parallelized. The authors argue that current architectures designed for parallel computation face fundamental constraints when dealing with inherently serial tasks. Complexity theory is used to formalize this distinction and highlight the necessity of scaling serial computation alongside parallel computation for continued progress in AI research. Recognizing the serial nature of computation has significant implications for machine learning, model design, and hardware development, particularly as AI tackles more complex reasoning tasks. Deliberately incorporating serial computation into AI systems is deemed crucial for advancing the field in handling increasingly intricate problems. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential. These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning, deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is essential for continued progress.

<div> Keywords: machine thinking, mental imagery, cognitive unit, input data unit, needs unit

Summary: 
The article addresses the limitations of existing AI models in autonomously reasoning and the challenge of integrating knowledge across domains. It proposes a machine thinking framework that incorporates mental imagery into the thinking process to enhance decision-making capabilities. The framework includes a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: Input Data Unit, Needs Unit, and Mental Imagery Unit. Data is represented as natural language sentences or sketches to aid in both information retrieval and decision-making processes. Validation tests were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Ultimately, the integration of mental imagery into machine thinking could potentially improve the way AI agents initiate the thinking process and make autonomous decisions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs, and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process, which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented and discussed.

Summary: 
- The article discusses the challenges of concept drift in data streams and the effectiveness of classifier fusion methods.
- A new method called IncA-DES is proposed, which promotes the generation of local experts and adapts to changing data distributions over time.
- The fusion of a concept drift detector helps adapt to new concepts and maintain information.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods. Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an online repository.

Summary:
Assay2Mol is a new approach for drug discovery that leverages unstructured text data from biochemical screening assays. By utilizing information on biological mechanisms, experimental protocols, and other assay attributes, Assay2Mol can recommend candidate molecules for new drug targets. This language model-based workflow retrieves assay records related to the target of interest and generates potential molecules through in-context learning. Compared to previous machine learning methods, Assay2Mol shows superior performance in generating ligand molecules for target proteins. It also prioritizes synthesizable molecule generation, making it a promising tool for early-stage drug discovery campaigns. <div>

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

The article investigates the clustering of ranking vectors, representing preferences in ordered lists of integers. The study focuses on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), proving its NP-hardness and characterizing its feasible set. Analytical solutions are derived for the single-cluster case, and an efficient approximation algorithm, KRCA, is developed to improve solution quality while maintaining computational efficiency. A branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm is introduced within KRCA for efficient cluster reconstruction, with theoretical error bounds established. Numerical experiments demonstrate that KRCA outperforms baseline solutions in terms of solution quality and computational time. The research sheds light on the practical importance of KRC for personalization and large-scale decision-making, offering methodological advancements that can be further explored in future studies.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically, we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights that can be built upon in future studies.

Summary:
The article discusses the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. It explores the relationship between different loss minimizers and their generalization bounds in the context of cost-sensitive classification. The log loss minimizer is shown to achieve a first-order bound, which scales with the cost of the best classifier. The study then introduces the concept of a variance-dependent bound, termed a second-order bound, which offers a strict improvement over first-order bounds. A novel loss function called the betting loss is proposed, which achieves a variance-adaptive bound without prior knowledge of the variance. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that explicitly model label variance or distribution in the function class. The findings suggest a promising direction for improving regression performance in $[0,1]$-valued problems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient} have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds. We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional reinforcement learning.

Summary: <br />
This paper presents two novel methods for tabular representation learning tailored to warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO). The methods are designed to capture the properties of landmarkers, a specific requirement formulated by the authors. One approach involves deep metric learning, while the other is based on landmarkers reconstruction. While the proposed encoders successfully learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not directly lead to significant performance gains in the HPO warm-starting meta-task. The evaluation of the encoders considers both the improvement in the target meta-task and the fulfillment of the requirement to capture landmarkers' properties. These results suggest that effective representation learning for heterogeneous tabular datasets in meta-learning contexts remains a challenging issue. <div>
arXiv:2507.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task - warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO warm-starting.

TASKPGM introduces a framework for optimizing the mixture of task datasets in large language models (LLMs) by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field. The framework selects continuous task proportions based on task relationships modeled using behavioral divergences. It provides a closed form solution under simplex constraints and balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. The method offers theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and shows empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral evaluation suites. TASKPGM also offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning. <div>
arXiv:2507.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

Summary:  
The article discusses the issue of startup overhead in Large Language Model (LLM) training, which can lead to wasted GPU time. The research provides an analysis of startup cost components, quantifies its impact, and explores how it scales with job size. To address these bottlenecks, a system-level optimization framework called Bootseer is introduced, targeting container image loading, dependency installation, and model checkpoint resumption. Bootseer implements techniques such as hot block record-and-prefetch, dependency snapshotting, and striped HDFS-FUSE, resulting in a 50% reduction in startup overhead. This optimization framework has been deployed in a real production environment and evaluated on LLM training workloads, showcasing its effectiveness in improving efficiency and reducing delays. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead.

Summary: 
The study explores the role of backtracking in reasoning models and its connection to directional steering in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. It suggests that backtracking emerges through repurposed directions already present in base model activations, specifically in Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream. This direction induces backtracking in the reasoning model but not in the base model, indicating a repurposing of pre-existing representations during reasoning finetuning. The findings imply that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose base model representations rather than learning new capabilities. The study hypothesizes that multiple directions may work together to mediate backtracking, highlighting the complexity of the underlying mechanisms. <div>
arXiv:2507.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities. Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations. Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities from scratch.

Summary:
Innovations in neural interfaces offer great potential for next-generation technologies, but the sensitive information encoded in neural signals poses privacy challenges. This study explores the use of federated learning (FL) for neural decoding, a promising privacy-preserving framework. In open-loop simulations, FL outperformed local learning methods, showcasing its ability for high-performance, privacy-conscious decoding. However, in closed-loop user studies, adaptations were needed to accommodate real-time interactions, where local learning methods surpassed the modified FL approach in performance. Despite this, local learning still carried higher privacy risks. This highlights a crucial tradeoff between performance and privacy in real-time adaptive applications, emphasizing the necessity for FL methods tailored for co-adaptive, single-user scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge. Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework, presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines, demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user applications.

Summary: 
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine physical laws with data-driven modeling for solving complex scientific problems. However, PINNs often struggle with extrapolation and sensitivity to activation functions. This paper introduces a transfer learning (TL) method within an extended training domain using a few collocation points to enhance extrapolation capabilities. An adaptive activation function that combines standard functions is also proposed to improve model robustness and accuracy. Experimental results show a 40% reduction in relative L2 error and a 50% decrease in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain without increased computational cost.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process, making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all without a significant increase in computational cost.

Current methodologies primarily address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details. Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries, comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various applications.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel continuous-time, matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework to understand the training dynamics of deep neural networks. The SDEs derived show that the squared singular values in weight matrices follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion. The stationary distributions are characterized by gamma-type densities with power-law tails, explaining the 'bulk+tail' spectral structure observed in trained networks. Controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures validate the theoretical predictions, demonstrating quantitative agreement between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution. This work provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the success of deep learning by connecting the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of singular-value spectra. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time, matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion, and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks. Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

Summary:
Dataset pruning is a data-centric approach that aims to improve the training efficiency and performance of deep learning models by selecting informative training samples. Existing methods often rely on static heuristics or task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness across different domains. In this work, a dynamic dataset pruning framework is introduced that adaptively selects samples based on task-driven difficulty and cross-modality semantic consistency. By leveraging supervision from pretrained multimodal foundation models, this approach captures training dynamics and filters out uninformative samples effectively. The integration of cross-modality alignment offers a promising path towards more efficient and robust data-centric learning practices across various application domains. <div>

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and robust practices across application domains.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new optimization framework called the Layer Separation (LySep) model to enhance deep learning methods for solving partial differential equations. The highly non-convex nature of deep learning loss functions can lead to suboptimal results or gradient-related issues. To tackle this, LySep introduces auxiliary variables to separate the layers of neural networks, essentially breaking down the deep architecture into shallower ones. New loss functions are defined with these auxiliary variables, facilitating optimal updates for many variables. The model is theoretically shown to align with the original deep model, and numerical experiments in high dimensions confirm its efficacy in minimizing loss and reducing solution error. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation (LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing, resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled. Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing solution error.

Summary: 
China's NEEQ, or the "New Third Board," serves as a vital financing platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, many NEEQ-listed companies face increased financial distress risks due to their limited scale and financial resilience. In response, a multi-channel deep learning framework is proposed to predict financial risks comprehensively. The framework integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures, and enterprise relationship data. A Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) is designed to process numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. Modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism and a gating unit to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on real-world NEEQ company data showcase the model's superiority over traditional machine learning methods and single-modality baselines in terms of key metrics like AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. This research contributes theoretical and practical insights into SME risk modeling and provides a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and investors.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures, and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction. Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy. Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and investors.

Summary: 
Time series prediction is a challenging task due to the complexities of time series data. Transformer-based architectures show promise but are not efficient for long-term predictions. State-Space Models like Mamba offer a more efficient alternative but struggle with capturing multi-scale periodicity and dealing with data noise. To address these limitations, a novel framework called FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba) is proposed. FLDmamba leverages Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics, and improve model robustness to data noise. Extensive experiments show that FLDmamba outperforms both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures in time series prediction benchmarks. The code and data for FLDmamba are made accessible for reproducibility at the provided URL.

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data, including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics, particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible via the following URL:{\href{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/FLDmamba}{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/\model}.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a Parallel Multi-Knowledge Learning-based Compressor (PMKLC) to address the limitations of existing lossless compressors in genomic database backup, storage, and transmission. The PMKLC framework integrates automated multi-knowledge learning for improved compression ratio and robustness. Additionally, a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder optimizes compression throughput, while data block partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms enable parallel acceleration. Two compression modes, PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M, cater to different application scenarios. Benchmarking against 14 baselines on various real-world datasets shows that PMKLC-S/M achieve significant improvements in compression ratio and throughput, by up to 73.609% and 10.710x, respectively. They also exhibit superior robustness and competitive memory usage, making them suitable for diverse genomic data analysis tasks. <div>

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their 1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge \underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness; 2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15 real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides, PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost, indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.

Summary:  
ReLOAD introduces a novel approach for offline RL that generates intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using Random Network Distillation (RND). A predictor network is trained to mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions, with the prediction error serving as a reward signal for each transition in the dataset. This structured reward signal eliminates the need for handcrafted reward annotations. The theoretical construct behind RND prediction errors as intrinsic rewards is outlined, highlighting how they differentiate expert-like transitions. Experiment results on the D4RL benchmark showcase ReLOAD's effectiveness in enabling robust offline policy learning, achieving competitive performance with traditional reward-annotated methods. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions. However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions. Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with traditional reward-annotated methods.

This study delves into the dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) eigenvectors during the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon in deep learning. It observes that larger learning rates result in leading eigenvectors of the final NTK matrix aligning more closely with the training target across various architectures.

The findings contribute to a better understanding of Gradient Descent (GD) training dynamics in deep learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training dynamics in deep learning.

<div> Distributional discrepancy, closeness testing, maximum mean discrepancy, norm-adaptive MMD, RKHS. 

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method, norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD), to assess the closeness levels of distribution pairs, particularly for complex data like images. While Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a powerful tool for measuring distributional discrepancies, it may not always provide informative results. NAMMD addresses this issue by scaling MMD values using the norms of distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The proposed NAMMD-based Distribution Closeness Testing (DCT) method demonstrates higher test power and controlled type-I error compared to MMD-based DCT. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of NAMMD on various types of data, including synthetic noise and real images. Additionally, NAMMD is successfully applied to two-sample testing, showing superior test power over MMD-based two-sample tests in both theoretical analysis and practical experiments. <div>
arXiv:2507.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions. Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair. Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images). Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Summary:
A new method for person identification using Wi-Fi sensing without user motion is introduced. The proposed transformer-based approach analyzes Channel State Information (CSI) captured while individuals are stationary. A dataset collected with ESP32 devices in a controlled indoor environment is used for evaluation, featuring six participants across various orientations.

arXiv:2507.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion, remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Behavior Cloning, Supervised Fine-Tuning, Importance Weighted, Large Language Models<br />
Summary:<br />
The article explores the connection between Behavior Cloning (BC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the context of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for language models and control policies. It clarifies that SFT aims to maximize a lower bound on the RL objective in sparse reward settings, explaining its observed success. The introduction of importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective, showing improved performance compared to traditional SFT. iw-SFT is easy to implement and can be expanded to training with quality scored data. The proposed SFT variants are competitive with advanced RL algorithms in tasks such as training large language models and policies for continuous control, achieving promising results on the AIME 2024 dataset. <div>

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks. For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG signals acquired through in-ear devices, commonly referred to as ear-EEG. Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low usability due to cumbersome scalp-based electrode setups. In this study, we propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication, demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a subject identification scenario. These findings confirm the potential of ear-EEG as a viable and deployable direction for next-generation real-world biometric systems.

This study introduces novel activation functions, SmoothSplit and ParametricSplit, that enhance neural networks' ability to manipulate data topology during training. Traditional activation functions like ReLU have limitations in transforming complex data manifolds effectively, especially in low-dimensional settings. SmoothSplit and ParametricSplit address this issue by introducing topology "cutting" capabilities, enabling networks to improve performance in scenarios with low-dimensional layers. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, the study shows that ParametricSplit outperforms traditional activations in low-dimensional settings while maintaining competitive performance in higher-dimensional ones.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a framework called VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning (VIDAR) for bimanual robotic manipulation. It leverages large-scale video pre-training and a masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. The video diffusion model is pre-trained on a vast dataset from multiple robot platforms, capturing various contexts. The masked inverse dynamics model extracts action-relevant information without the need for pixel-level labels. With minimal human demonstrations, VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds, showcasing strong semantic understanding. This approach shows promise for scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning (VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

<div> explanation quality, rejector, machine learning, predictors, trust assessment <br />
Summary: <br />
Machine learning predictors are used in high-stakes applications like credit scoring, but explanations of their predictions are not always high quality. In response, a framework called Learning to Reject Low-quality Explanations (LtX) is introduced, where classifiers can refuse inputs with poorly explained predictions. The challenge lies in defining and assessing explanation quality and designing a suitable rejector. ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector) is proposed, which learns to reject low-quality explanations based on human ratings and relevance judgments. ULER outperforms state-of-the-art strategies in LtX on various benchmarks and a new human-annotated dataset. This dataset will be released for future research purposes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is, end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future research.

Summary:
Fremer is introduced as an efficient and effective deep forecasting model specifically designed for workload forecasting in cloud service applications. It outperforms most Transformer-based models in terms of efficiency while achieving exceptional accuracy surpassing all state-of-the-art models in workload forecasting. Fremer displays robust performance for multi-period series, addressing the challenges of complicated periodic patterns often seen in workload data. The model is evaluated on high-quality open-source datasets from ByteDance's cloud services, exhibiting consistent improvements over baseline models in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). In practical applications such as proactive auto-scaling in Kubernetes, Fremer reduces resource consumption by 2.35% and improves average latency by 18.78%, showcasing its efficacy in real-world scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model. Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of 5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally, in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its practical efficacy in real-world applications.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, prediction uncertainty, explainability, epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty

Summary:
This paper discusses the importance of transparency in machine learning models and proposes leveraging prediction uncertainty as a method for enhancing explainability. The authors differentiate between aleatoric uncertainty, related to data, and epistemic uncertainty, related to the model, to guide the selection of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty can be used as a rejection criterion for unreliable explanations and provides insights into insufficient training. Aleatoric uncertainty helps choose between feature-importance and counterfactual explanations. The framework presented in the paper combines uncertainty quantification and disentanglement to drive explainability methods. The experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of this uncertainty-aware approach in improving the robustness and clarity of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric (data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning scenarios.

Summary: 
The article introduces TReconLM, a novel approach to trace reconstruction that utilizes language models trained on next-token prediction for better performance. It addresses the general trace reconstruction problem, which involves recovering an original sequence from corrupted copies with deletions, insertions, and substitutions.

This technique offers a promising solution for improving trace reconstruction in various applications, especially in DNA data storage where accuracy is crucial for data retrieval and error correction. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TReconLM in accurately reconstructing sequences, showcasing its potential for enhancing data storage and retrieval mechanisms in the future.

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions, insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work, we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

<div> Keywords: DAPO algorithm, policy gradient methods, off-policy experience, training stability, sample efficiency

Summary:<br />
This paper presents two modifications to the DAPO algorithm that improve its stability and sample efficiency. The first modification introduces a pre-trained guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, enhancing the training of the target policy ($\pion$) by adjusting the learning step size. The second modification re-uses zero-reward samples, typically discarded by dynamic sampling strategies, by treating them as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy. Theoretical analysis shows that both methods converge to the optimal solution within the reinforcement learning framework. The mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, leading to more stable and efficient policy optimization. Overall, these modifications offer significant improvements in training stability, convergence speed, and sample efficiency for the DAPO algorithm.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units, reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$, $1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application domains.

Current error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors. ARES judges each claim based only on previously-assessed sound premises to avoid error propagation.

arXiv:2507.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).

Summary:
Interpretability is crucial for enhancing the safety, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI models, particularly in healthcare settings where decisions have significant consequences. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) offer a promising method for achieving mechanistic interpretability within complex transformer-based models. In this study, Matryoshka-SAE is applied to MAIRA-2, a radiology-specialized multimodal large language model, to unveil human-interpretable features. Through large-scale automated interpretability analysis, clinically relevant concepts such as medical devices, pathologies, longitudinal changes, and textual features are identified. The influence of these features on model behavior is explored through steering, showcasing some degree of directional control over model outputs. Despite encountering challenges, this study provides initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2, facilitating a deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of radiology-adapted multimodal language models. The trained SAEs and interpretations are made publicly available to promote further research.

Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model transparency.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new variant of the Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) model, addressing the issue of over-smoothing that can occur when applying GNNs to graphs. By incorporating a Fairing algorithm, originally used in surface design, as a spectral filter in the reservoir, the model enables controlled smoothing without signal distortion. The algorithm's spectral formulation allows for adaptation to graph settings through the Laplacian operator, connecting seamlessly to GNN architectures that benefit from controlled smoothing. The paper includes a theoretical analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective, demonstrating how spectral coefficients modulate redundant random walks' contributions. Experimental results with the MRGNN architecture showcase the potential of this approach for graph classification tasks, pointing towards promising research directions in the field. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.12963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest promising directions for future research.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for infrastructure health monitoring, using drive-by vibration signals. The framework, called WaveletInception-BiLSTM, incorporates spectral and temporal information. It utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) for feature extraction and 1D Inception networks for multi-scale, high-level feature extraction. The LSTM layer integrates vibration signal features with operational conditions to capture temporal dependencies.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks, capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements. This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by infrastructure health monitoring.

<div> Keywords: Federated Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Decentralized Training, Distributed Data, Privacy Concerns

Summary:
Federated Learning is being used to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown success in various domains but require large datasets and computational resources. This article proposes a decentralized GAN training approach that utilizes distributed data and underutilized devices while maintaining data privacy. It combines KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning and Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to address data and device heterogeneity without sharing raw data between nodes. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in image generation scores and classification metrics with lower latency compared to benchmarks. The proposed approach offers a solution to the challenges of training generative models in decentralized environments with limited resources and strict data sharing constraints.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

- FedGA is a fairness-aware federated learning algorithm designed to address performance disparities among clients in federated settings.
- The Gini coefficient is used to measure performance disparity, and its relationship with the global model update scale is leveraged for fairness intervention.
- FedGA dynamically adjusts aggregation weights based on real-time fairness status to improve global model performance.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model ${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10, CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

<div> Keywords: Sparse Autoencoders, Large Language Models, residual learning, domain-specific features, interpretability

Summary: 
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have become valuable tools for understanding the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they often struggle to capture domain-specific features not present in their training data. This paper proposes a residual learning approach to address this limitation without requiring complete retraining. The approach involves training a secondary SAE to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, thereby capturing missed features. By combining the outputs of both models during inference, significant improvements in LLM performance metrics across specialized domains were demonstrated. This method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining performance on general tasks. It offers a way for researchers to enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains, facilitating targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.

Summary: 
This paper proposes a framework for knowledge graph representation learning that focuses on relation-specific geometric transformations. By ranking how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations, the model can assign the best-matching transformation to each relation or use majority voting to choose one transformation type for all relations. The model learns a single relation-specific elementary geometric transformation (EGT) in a low-dimensional vector space using an attention mechanism. Additionally, the correlation between relations and EGTs learned in low-dimensional space is utilized for relation embeddings in a high-dimensional vector space. The effectiveness of the proposed models is demonstrated through evaluations on benchmark knowledge graphs as well as a real-world financial knowledge graph, showing comparable performance to leading models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a performance comparable to leading models

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach to onboard fault detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system controlling engine valves in reusable space launchers. Unlike previous methods, this solution addresses key requirements such as confidence level estimation, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, and false alarm control. It utilizes a temporal convolutional autoencoder to extract features from sensor data, with binary and multiclass classifiers trained on latent and residual spaces for fault detection and diagnosis. The classifiers output probabilities as confidence levels, and OOD data is identified using inductive conformal anomaly detection. Additional techniques like CUSUM and threshold moving are employed to limit false alarms and address class imbalance. Evaluation on simulated data shows promising results, but real data testing is necessary for operational readiness. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases, and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios. The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the required maturity level for operational use.

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows, indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However, existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs, enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models, reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

- The study examines the PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes comprising copies of a countably infinite graph G induced by permuting G's vertices with finite support.
- The main finding indicates that the PAC learnability of finite-support copies implies the online learnability of the full isomorphism type of G and is linked to automorphic triviality.
- The research characterized graphs where induced copies by swapping two vertices are not learnable by relaxing the extension property of the infinite random graph.
- For all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, leading to a partition of infinite graphs into four classes with determined complexity.
- Tools from descriptive set theory and computability theory were utilized to determine the complexity of the graph classes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT) is introduced to improve the efficiency of Neural Architecture Search for Vision Transformers (ViTs). DASViT bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel architectural designs. Unlike traditional discrete methods, DASViT allows for more innovative designs and requires fewer computational resources and less time. Experimental results demonstrate that DASViT outperforms ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, breaking traditional Transformer encoder designs, while achieving superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs. DASViT represents a significant advancement in automating the design of neural networks, particularly in the context of Vision Transformers. <div>
arXiv:2507.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use, inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT), researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs. Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

arXiv:2507.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems. The source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models. Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations (NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso, using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics, including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive TTS research. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepvk/NonverbalTTS.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable, controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and IRL techniques.

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning, from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics, and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In [arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our method for a robot swarm control problem.

<title>MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling</title>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.

<title>Leveraging Asynchronous Cross-border Market Data for Improved Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting in European Markets</title>

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22% and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3) respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs, and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

<title>Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity. The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line, which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation space.

<title>Boosting Team Modeling through Tempo-Relational Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative environments.

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant. These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with limited data availability.

<title>Training Transformers with Enforced Lipschitz Constants</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations. This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training. We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly. Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

<title>The Generalist Brain Module: Module Repetition in Neural Networks in Light of the Minicolumn Hypothesis</title>

Abstract: While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness, adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits. Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain. Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts, simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models, demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability, and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches, achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is https://sites.google.com/view/founder-rl.

Abstract: Most Differentially Private (DP) approaches focus on limiting privacy leakage from learners based on the data that they are trained on, there are fewer approaches that consider leakage when procedures involve a calibration dataset which is common in uncertainty quantification methods such as Conformal Prediction (CP). Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with respect to the desired $(1 - \alpha)$-level when using finite-sample calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness. Specifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal prediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy guarantees in all these experimental settings.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ. To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels. Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator, which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned with human-like hierarchical reasoning.

Previous studies have demonstrated that these matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse directed graphs.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared to conventional single-GPU execution.

Abstract: Physical modelling synthesis aims to generate audio from physical simulations of vibrating structures. Thin elastic plates are a common model for drum membranes. Traditional numerical methods like finite differences and finite elements offer high accuracy but are computationally demanding, limiting their use in real-time audio applications. This paper presents a comparative analysis of neural network-based approaches for solving the vibration of nonlinear elastic plates. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, trained on short sequences, for prediction of long sequences in an autoregressive fashion. We show some of the limitations of these models, and why is not enough to look at the prediction error in the time domain. We discuss the implications for real-time audio synthesis and propose future directions for improving neural approaches to model nonlinear vibration.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors. Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows, we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally, workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop mapping.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed, grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning. We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community. Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite, VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our benchmark and code.

<title>A Novel Data Augmentation Strategy for Robust Deep Learning Classification of Biomedical Time-Series Data: Application to ECG and EEG Analysis</title>

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy: time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on low-end or wearable devices.

Abstract: We reinterpret and propose a framework for pricing path-dependent financial derivatives by estimating the full distribution of payoffs using Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL). Unlike traditional methods that focus on expected option value, our approach models the entire conditional distribution of payoffs, allowing for risk-aware pricing, tail-risk estimation, and enhanced uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method on Asian options, using quantile-based value function approximators.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for real-time vehicle state estimation

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model (LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or (ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal. We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical, scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically, we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter $n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order $n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries. Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.

Abstract: Developing precise and computationally efficient traffic accident anticipation system is crucial for contemporary autonomous driving technologies, enabling timely intervention and loss prevention. In this paper, we propose an accident anticipation framework employing a dual-branch architecture that effectively integrates visual information from dashcam videos with structured textual data derived from accident reports. Furthermore, we introduce a feature aggregation method that facilitates seamless integration of multimodal inputs through large models (GPT-4o, Long-CLIP), complemented by targeted prompt engineering strategies to produce actionable feedback and standardized accident archives. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, and A3D) validate the superior predictive accuracy, enhanced responsiveness, reduced computational overhead, and improved interpretability of our approach, thus establishing a new benchmark for state-of-the-art performance in traffic accident anticipation.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators, effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise. Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $ 30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder (DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51% improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using replay-based video validation.

Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience. Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech, will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user, each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$ of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$ queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio personalization.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner, ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

Abstract: In observational studies, confounding variables affect both treatment and outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet), which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: In speech processing pipelines, improving the quality and intelligibility of real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and 308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs) often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing 35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and relevance (0.94).

Abstract: Person Re-Identification is a key and challenging task in video surveillance. While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting, occlusion, and suboptimal angles often hinder performance. To address these challenges, we introduce WhoFi, a novel pipeline that utilizes Wi-Fi signals for person re-identification. Biometric features are extracted from Channel State Information (CSI) and processed through a modular Deep Neural Network (DNN) featuring a Transformer-based encoder. The network is trained using an in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals.

Abstract: The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new, useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in dynamically changing load and resource environments.

<title>VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving.

<title>DMQ: Dissecting Outliers of Diffusion Models for Post-Training Quantization</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness across the dataset.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset.

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health, economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models, enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning. Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99% of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection (DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Predicting a response with partially missing inputs remains a challenging task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis, PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation, calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear features.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity. To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts, demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information, weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA) module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Abstract: We use machine learning to search for examples of Z/2 eigenfunctions on the 2-sphere. For this we created a multivalued version of a feedforward deep neural network, and we implemented it using the JAX library. We found Z/2 eigenfunctions for three cases: In the first two cases we fixed the branch points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and at a cube respectively. In a third case, we allowed the AI to move the branch points around and, in the end, it positioned the branch points at the vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at https://lmb-freiburg.github.io/orbis.github.io/.

<title>SHIELD: A Secure and Highly Enhanced Integrated Learning for Robust Deepfake Detection against Adversarial Attacks</title>

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification, voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore, we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild, and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models. The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%, and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

Abstract: The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

<title>Computational-Statistical Tradeoffs from NP-hardness</title>

Abstract: A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$ requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak, and Xiao (2008).

Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery pipelines.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms, sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection. Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

<title>Stochastic Weakly Convex Optimization Under Heavy-Tailed Noises</title>

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with $p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC taxi data.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50 demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at https://riccizz.github.io/HRF_coupling.

Abstract: We introduce Boolformer, a Transformer-based model trained to perform end-to-end symbolic regression of Boolean functions. First, we show that it can predict compact formulas for complex functions not seen during training, given their full truth table. Then, we demonstrate that even with incomplete or noisy observations, Boolformer is still able to find good approximate expressions. We evaluate Boolformer on a broad set of real-world binary classification datasets, demonstrating its potential as an interpretable alternative to classic machine learning methods. Finally, we apply it to the widespread task of modeling the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and show through a benchmark that Boolformer is competitive with state-of-the-art genetic algorithms, with a speedup of several orders of magnitude. Our code and models are available publicly.

Abstract: Machine Learning research, including work promoting fair or equitable algorithms, heavily relies on the concept of a data-generating probability distribution. The standard presumption is that since data points are 'sampled from' such a distribution, one can learn from observed data about this distribution and, thus, predict future data points which are also drawn from it. We argue, however, that such true probability distributions do not exist and should not be dealt with uncritically. We show that alternative frameworks focusing directly on relevant populations rather than abstract distributions are available and leave classical learning theory almost unchanged. Furthermore, we argue that the assumption of true probabilities or data-generating distributions can be misleading and obscure both the choices made and the goals pursued in machine learning practice. Based on these considerations, this position paper argues that, at least in social settings, machine learning work should avoid assuming data-generating probability distributions.

Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as those found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent that depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) has been widely used to model constrained sequential decision making problems, where the state of each restless arm evolves according to a Markov chain and each state transition generates a scalar reward. However, the success of RMAB crucially relies on the availability and quality of reward signals. Unfortunately, specifying an exact reward function in practice can be challenging and even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of \textit{preference} signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise preference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each decision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less information than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more difficult. To address this challenge, we present a direct online preference learning (DOPL) algorithm for Pref-RMAB to efficiently explore the unknown environments, adaptively collect preference data in an online manner, and directly leverage the preference feedback for decision-makings. We prove that DOPL yields a sublinear regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T\ln T})$ regret for RMAB with preference feedback. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of DOPL.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models represent a significant advancement in large language model (LLM) development through their efficient parameter utilization. These models achieve substantial performance improvements at reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results validate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for real-world deployments.

Abstract: With a warming planet, tropical regions are expected to experience the brunt of climate change, with more intense and more volatile rainfall events. Currently, state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are known to struggle to produce skillful rainfall forecasts in tropical regions of Africa. There is thus a pressing need for improved rainfall forecasting in these regions. Over the last decade or so, the increased availability of large-scale meteorological datasets and the development of powerful machine learning models have opened up new opportunities for data-driven weather forecasting. Focusing on Ghana in this study, we use these tools to develop two U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) models, to predict 24h rainfall at 12h and 30h lead-time. The models were trained using data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, and the GPM-IMERG dataset. A special attention was paid to interpretability. We developed a novel statistical methodology that allowed us to probe the relative importance of the meteorological variables input in our model, offering useful insights into the factors that drive precipitation in the Ghana region. Empirically, we found that our 12h lead-time model has performances that match, and in some accounts are better than the 18h lead-time forecasts produced by the ECMWF (as available in the TIGGE dataset). We also found that combining our data-driven model with classical NWP further improves forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLM that reduces memory requirements. However, current LoRA optimizers lack transformation invariance, meaning the actual updates to the weights depends on how the two LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. This deficiency leads to inefficient learning and sub-optimal solutions in practice. This paper introduces LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method for LoRA optimization, which can achieve transformation invariance and remain computationally efficient. We provide theoretical analysis to demonstrate the benefit of our method and conduct experiments on various LLM tasks with different models including Gemma 2B, 7B, and mT5-XXL. The results demonstrate consistent improvements against existing optimizers. For example, replacing Adam with LoRA-RITE during LoRA fine-tuning of Gemma-2B yielded 4.6\% accuracy gain on Super-Natural Instructions and 3.5\% accuracy gain across other four LLM benchmarks (HellaSwag, ArcChallenge, GSM8K, OpenBookQA).

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables multiple agents to collaboratively learn a policy without sharing their local trajectories collected during agent-environment interactions. However, in practice, the environments faced by different agents are often heterogeneous, leading to poor performance by the single policy learned by existing FedRL algorithms on individual agents. In this paper, we take a further step and introduce a \emph{personalized} FedRL framework (PFedRL) by taking advantage of possibly shared common structure among agents in heterogeneous environments. Specifically, we develop a class of PFedRL algorithms named PFedRL-Rep that learns (1) a shared feature representation collaboratively among all agents, and (2) an agent-specific weight vector personalized to its local environment. We analyze the convergence of PFedTD-Rep, a particular instance of the framework with temporal difference (TD) learning and linear representations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a linear convergence speedup with respect to the number of agents in the PFedRL setting. To achieve this, we show that PFedTD-Rep is an example of the federated two-timescale stochastic approximation with Markovian noise. Experimental results demonstrate that PFedTD-Rep, along with an extension to the control setting based on deep Q-networks (DQN), not only improve learning in heterogeneous settings, but also provide better generalization to new environments.

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.

Abstract: We present three improvements to the standard model-based RL paradigm based on transformers: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, but only starts using imaginary data after the world model has been sufficiently trained; (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" for image patches, which improves upon previous tokenization schemes, which are needed when using a transformer world model (TWM), by ensuring the code words are static after creation, thus providing a constant target for TWM learning; and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep, instead of generating them sequentially. We then show that our method significantly improves upon prior methods in various environments. We mostly focus on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, where our method achieves a reward of 69.66% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and exceeding human performance of 65.0% for the first time. We also show preliminary results on Craftax-full, MinAtar, and three different two-player games, to illustrate the generality of the approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces PINT (Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models), a framework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models to improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications.

Abstract: Dynamical systems, prevalent in various scientific and engineering domains, are susceptible to anomalies that can significantly impact their performance and reliability. This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching, and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.

Abstract: User specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be removed from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This requires deleting or "forgetting" a set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it.

Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.

Abstract: Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation management, yet existing approaches often lack the integration capabilities needed to handle diverse data sources. We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.

Abstract: The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility.

Abstract: This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.

Abstract: Popular PEFT methods reduce trainable parameter count for fine-tuning by parameterizing new low-rank or sparse trainable weights in parallel to the frozen pre-trained weights $W$. However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with \textbf{9$\boldsymbol\times$} fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.

Abstract: Crowdworking is a cost-efficient solution for acquiring class labels. Since these labels are subject to noise, various approaches to learning from crowds have been proposed. Typically, these approaches are evaluated with default hyperparameter configurations, resulting in unfair and suboptimal performance, or with hyperparameter configurations tuned via a validation set with ground truth class labels, representing an often unrealistic scenario. Moreover, both setups can produce different approach rankings, complicating study comparisons. Therefore, we introduce crowd-hpo as a framework for evaluating approaches to learning from crowds in combination with criteria to select well-performing hyperparameter configurations with access only to noisy crowd-labeled validation data. Extensive experiments with neural networks demonstrate that these criteria select hyperparameter configurations, which improve the learning from crowd approaches' generalization performances, measured on separate test sets with ground truth labels. Hence, incorporating such criteria into experimental studies is essential for enabling fairer and more realistic benchmarking.

Abstract: Collecting human preference feedback is often expensive, leading recent works to develop principled algorithms to select them more efficiently. However, these works assume that the underlying reward function is linear, an assumption that does not hold in many real-life applications, such as online recommendation and LLM alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Neural-ADB, an algorithm based on the neural contextual dueling bandit framework that provides a principled and practical method for collecting human preference feedback when the underlying latent reward function is non-linear. We theoretically show that when preference feedback follows the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the worst sub-optimality gap of the policy learned by Neural-ADB decreases at a sub-linear rate as the preference dataset increases. Our experimental results on preference datasets further corroborate the effectiveness of Neural-ADB.

Abstract: Tabular data is one of the most prevalent and important data formats in real-world applications such as healthcare, finance, and education. However, its effective use in machine learning is often constrained by data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic tabular data generation has emerged as a powerful solution, leveraging generative models to learn underlying data distributions and produce realistic, privacy-preserving samples. Although this area has seen growing attention, most existing surveys focus narrowly on specific methods (e.g., GANs or privacy-enhancing techniques), lacking a unified and comprehensive view that integrates recent advances such as diffusion models and large language models (LLMs).
  In this survey, we present a structured and in-depth review of synthetic tabular data generation methods. Specifically, the survey is organized into three core components: (1) Background, which covers the overall generation pipeline, including problem definitions, synthetic tabular data generation methods, post processing, and evaluation; (2) Generation Methods, where we categorize existing approaches into traditional generation methods, diffusion model methods, and LLM-based methods, and compare them in terms of architecture, generation quality, and applicability; and (3) Applications and Challenges, which summarizes practical use cases, highlights common datasets, and discusses open challenges such as heterogeneity, data fidelity, and privacy protection.
  This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a holistic understanding of the field and to highlight key directions for future work in synthetic tabular data generation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle, including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation. Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable, efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control.

<title>Uni-Instruct: One-step Diffusion Model through Unified Diffusion Divergence Instruction</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.

Abstract: Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters.

<title>Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application</title>

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.

Abstract: We propose a novel particle-based variational inference method designed to work with multimodal distributions. Our approach, referred to as Branched Stein Variational Gradient Descent (BSVGD), extends the classical Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm by incorporating a random branching mechanism that encourages the exploration of the state space. In this work, a theoretical guarantee for the convergence in distribution is presented, as well as numerical experiments to validate the suitability of our algorithm. Performance comparisons between the BSVGD and the SVGD are presented using the Wasserstein distance between samples and the corresponding computational times.

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models. Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose cross-layer VQ-VAE (CLVQ-VAE), a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-k temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic structure in word embedding space.

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.

Abstract: The z-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its $z$-transform. In particular, the z-transform method focuses on asymptotic behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the z-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: Binary neural networks, i.e., neural networks whose parameters and activations are constrained to only two possible values, offer a compelling avenue for the deployment of deep learning models on energy- and memory-limited devices. However, their training, architectural design, and hyperparameter tuning remain challenging as these involve multiple computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems. Here we introduce quantum hypernetworks as a mechanism to train binary neural networks on quantum computers, which unify the search over parameters, hyperparameters, and architectures in a single optimization loop. Through classical simulations, we demonstrate that our approach effectively finds optimal parameters, hyperparameters and architectural choices with high probability on classification problems including a two-dimensional Gaussian dataset and a scaled-down version of the MNIST handwritten digits. We represent our quantum hypernetworks as variational quantum circuits, and find that an optimal circuit depth maximizes the probability of finding performant binary neural networks. Our unified approach provides an immense scope for other applications in the field of machine learning.

Abstract: Engineers are deploying ML models as parts of real-world systems with the upsurge of AI technologies. Real-world environments challenge the deployment of such systems because these environments produce large amounts of heterogeneous data, and users require increasingly efficient responses. These requirements push prevalent software architectures to the limit when deploying ML-based systems. Data-oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging style that equips systems better for integrating ML models. Even though papers on deployed ML systems do not mention DOA, their authors made design decisions that implicitly follow DOA. Implicit decisions create a knowledge gap, limiting the practitioners' ability to implement ML-based systems. \hlb{This paper surveys why, how, and to what extent practitioners have adopted DOA to implement and deploy ML-based systems.} We overcome the knowledge gap by answering these questions and explicitly showing the design decisions and practices behind these systems. The survey follows a well-known systematic and semi-automated methodology for reviewing papers in software engineering. The majority of reviewed works partially adopt DOA. Such an adoption enables systems to address requirements such as Big Data management, low latency processing, resource management, security and privacy. Based on these findings, we formulate practical advice to facilitate the deployment of ML-based systems.

Abstract: APT detection is difficult to detect due to the long-term latency, covert and slow multistage attack patterns of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). To tackle these issues, we propose TBDetector, a transformer-based advanced persistent threat detection method for APT attack detection. Considering that provenance graphs provide rich historical information and have the powerful attacks historic correlation ability to identify anomalous activities, TBDetector employs provenance analysis for APT detection, which summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency and utilizes transformer with self-attention based encoder-decoder to extract long-term contextual features of system states to detect slow-acting attacks. Furthermore, we further introduce anomaly scores to investigate the anomaly of different system states, where each state is calculated with an anomaly score corresponding to its similarity score and isolation score. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments on five public datasets, i.e., streamspot, cadets, shellshock, clearscope, and wget_baseline. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have exhibited better performance of our proposed method.

Abstract: Clustering is one of the most important tools for analysis of large datasets, and perhaps the most popular clustering algorithm is Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means. This algorithm takes $n$ vectors $V=[v_1,\dots,v_n]\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ and outputs $k$ centroids $c_1,\dots,c_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$; these partition the vectors into clusters based on which centroid is closest to a particular vector. We present a classical $\varepsilon$-$k$-means algorithm that performs an approximate version of one iteration of Lloyd's algorithm with time complexity $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F^2}{n}\frac{k^{2}d}{\varepsilon^2}(k + \log{n})\big)$, exponentially improving the dependence on the data size $n$ and matching that of the "$q$-means" quantum algorithm originally proposed by Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash (NeurIPS'19). Moreover, we propose an improved $q$-means quantum algorithm with time complexity $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{k^{3/2}d}{\varepsilon}(\sqrt{k}+\sqrt{d})(\sqrt{k} + \log{n})\big)$ that quadratically improves the runtime of our classical $\varepsilon$-$k$-means algorithm in several parameters. Our quantum algorithm does not rely on quantum linear algebra primitives of prior work, but instead only uses QRAM to prepare simple states based on the current iteration's clusters and multivariate quantum amplitude estimation. Finally, we provide classical and quantum query lower bounds, showing that our algorithms are optimal in most parameters.

Abstract: Regression on manifolds, and, more broadly, statistics on manifolds, has garnered significant importance in recent years due to the vast number of applications for non Euclidean data. Circular data is a classic example, but so is data in the space of covariance matrices, data on the Grassmannian manifold obtained as a result of principal component analysis, among many others. In this work we investigate prediction sets for regression scenarios when the response variable, denoted by $Y$, resides in a manifold, and the covariable, denoted by $X$, lies in an Euclidean space. This extends the concepts delineated in \cite{waser14} to this novel context. Aligning with traditional principles in conformal inference, these prediction sets are distribution-free, indicating that no specific assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$, and they maintain a non-parametric character. We prove the asymptotic almost sure convergence of the empirical version of these regions on the manifold to their population counterparts. The efficiency of this method is shown through a comprehensive simulation study and an analysis involving real-world data.

Abstract: The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due to privacy-related issues. In addition, the recent increase in Vision Language Models (VLM) leads to the need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding medical scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set. Starting with the well-known multimodal data set MedPix\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a Graphical User Interface aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning VLMs. To enforce this point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a Retrieve Augmented Generation-based VLM model trained upon MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B, and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The standard approach to causal modelling especially in social and health sciences is the potential outcomes framework due to Neyman and Rubin. In this framework, observations are thought to be drawn from a distribution over variables of interest, and the goal is to identify parameters of this distribution. Even though the stated goal is often to inform decision making on some target population, there is no straightforward way to include these target populations in the framework. Instead of modelling the relationship between the observed sample and the target population, the inductive assumptions in this framework take the form of abstract sampling and independence assumptions. In this paper, we develop a version of this framework that construes causal inference as treatment-wise predictions for finite populations where all assumptions are testable in retrospect; this means that one can not only test predictions themselves (without any fundamental problem) but also investigate sources of error when they fail. Due to close connections to the original framework, established methods can still be be analysed under the new framework.

Abstract: With a potentially increasing share of the electricity grid relying on wind to provide generating capacity and energy, there is an expanding global need for historically accurate, spatiotemporally continuous, high-resolution wind data. Conventional downscaling methods for generating these data based on numerical weather prediction have a high computational burden and require extensive tuning for historical accuracy. In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based spatiotemporal downscaling method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating historically accurate high-resolution wind resource data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Reanalysis version 5 data (ERA5). In contrast to previous approaches, which used coarsened high-resolution data as low-resolution training data, we use true low-resolution simulation outputs. We show that by training a GAN model with ERA5 as the low-resolution input and Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK) data as the high-resolution target, we achieved results comparable in historical accuracy and spatiotemporal variability to conventional dynamical downscaling. This GAN-based downscaling method additionally reduces computational costs over dynamical downscaling by two orders of magnitude. We applied this approach to downscale 30 km, hourly ERA5 data to 2 km, 5 min wind data for January 2000 through December 2023 at multiple hub heights over Ukraine, Moldova, and part of Romania. This 24-year data record is the first member of the super-resolution for renewable energy resource data with wind from the reanalysis data dataset (Sup3rWind).

Abstract: Quantum computing combined with machine learning (ML) is a highly promising research area, with numerous studies demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to solve scientific problems more effectively than classical ML. In this work, we present Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), a QML architecture, and demonstrate its effectiveness in drug discovery. We evaluate QLSTM on five benchmark datasets (BBBP, BACE, SIDER, BCAP37, T-47D), and observe consistent performance gains over classical LSTM, with ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 3% to over 6%. Furthermore, QLSTM exhibits improved predictive accuracy as the number of qubits increases, and faster convergence than classical LSTM under the same training conditions. Notably, QLSTM maintains strong robustness against quantum computer noise, outperforming noise-free classical LSTM in certain settings. These findings highlight the potential of QLSTM as a scalable and noise-resilient model for scientific applications, particularly as quantum hardware continues to advance in qubit capacity and fidelity.

Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain. We consider the problem of how efficiently shallow neural networks with the ReLU$^k$ activation function can approximate functions from Sobolev spaces $W^s(L_p(\Omega))$ with error measured in the $L_q(\Omega)$-norm. Utilizing the Radon transform and recent results from discrepancy theory, we provide a simple proof of nearly optimal approximation rates in a variety of cases, including when $q\leq p$, $p\geq 2$, and $s \leq k + (d+1)/2$. The rates we derive are optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly generalize existing results. An interesting consequence is that the adaptivity of shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks enables them to obtain optimal approximation rates for smoothness up to order $s = k + (d+1)/2$, even though they represent piecewise polynomials of fixed degree $k$.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical task in machine learning and statistics. However, existing feature selection methods either (i) rely on parametric methods such as linear or generalized linear models, (ii) lack theoretical false discovery control, or (iii) identify few true positives. Here, we introduce a general feature selection method with finite-sample false discovery control based on applying integrated path stability selection (IPSS) to arbitrary feature importance scores. The method is nonparametric whenever the importance scores are nonparametric, and it estimates q-values, which are better suited to high-dimensional data than p-values. We focus on two special cases using importance scores from gradient boosting (IPSSGB) and random forests (IPSSRF). Extensive nonlinear simulations with RNA sequencing data show that both methods accurately control the false discovery rate and detect more true positives than existing methods. Both methods are also efficient, running in under 20 seconds when there are 500 samples and 5000 features. We apply IPSSGB and IPSSRF to detect microRNAs and genes related to cancer, finding that they yield better predictions with fewer features than existing approaches.

<title>A column generation algorithm with dynamic constraint aggregation for minimum sum-of-squares clustering</title>

Abstract: The minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem (MSSC), also known as $k$-means clustering, refers to the problem of partitioning $n$ data points into $k$ clusters, with the objective of minimizing the total sum of squared Euclidean distances between each point and the center of its assigned cluster. We propose an efficient algorithm for solving large-scale MSSC instances, which combines column generation (CG) with dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) to effectively reduce the number of constraints considered in the CG master problem. DCA was originally conceived to reduce degeneracy in set partitioning problems by utilizing an aggregated restricted master problem obtained from a partition of the set partitioning constraints into disjoint clusters. In this work, we explore the use of DCA within a CG algorithm for MSSC exact solution. Our method is fine-tuned by a series of ablation studies on DCA design choices, and is demonstrated to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art exact approaches available in the literature.

Abstract: Prompt optimization is essential for effective utilization of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks. While existing optimization methods are effective in optimizing short prompts, they struggle with longer, more complex ones, often risking information loss and being sensitive to small perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic Tuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a hierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information while applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt modifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks.

<title>Unified Triplet-Level Hallucination Evaluation for Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset that is the result of a user study on the comprehensibility of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. The study participants were recruited from 149 candidates to form three groups representing experts in the domain of mycology (DE), students with a data science and visualization background (IT) and students from social sciences and humanities (SSH). The main part of the dataset contains 39 transcripts of interviews during which participants were asked to complete a series of tasks and questions related to the interpretation of explanations of decisions of a machine learning model trained to distinguish between edible and inedible mushrooms. The transcripts were complemented with additional data that includes visualizations of explanations presented to the user, results from thematic analysis, recommendations of improvements of explanations provided by the participants, and the initial survey results that allow to determine the domain knowledge of the participant and data analysis literacy. The transcripts were manually tagged to allow for automatic matching between the text and other data related to particular fragments. In the advent of the area of rapid development of XAI techniques, the need for a multidisciplinary qualitative evaluation of explainability is one of the emerging topics in the community. Our dataset allows not only to reproduce the study we conducted, but also to open a wide range of possibilities for the analysis of the material we gathered.

Abstract: MuZero has achieved superhuman performance in various games by using a dynamics network to predict the environment dynamics for planning, without relying on simulators. However, the latent states learned by the dynamics network make its planning process opaque. This paper aims to demystify MuZero's model by interpreting the learned latent states. We incorporate observation reconstruction and state consistency into MuZero training and conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate latent states across two board games: 9x9 Go and Gomoku, and three Atari games: Breakout, Ms. Pacman, and Pong. Our findings reveal that while the dynamics network becomes less accurate over longer simulations, MuZero still performs effectively by using planning to correct errors. Our experiments also show that the dynamics network learns better latent states in board games than in Atari games. These insights contribute to a better understanding of MuZero and offer directions for future research to improve the performance, robustness, and interpretability of the MuZero algorithm. The code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/demystifying-muzero-planning.

<title>Uncertainty quantification for White Matter Hyperintensity segmentation detects silent failures and improves automated Fazekas quantification</title>

Abstract: White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are key neuroradiological markers of small vessel disease present in brain MRI. Assessment of WMH is important in research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g head motion). In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in UQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the model. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles also yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions. We further demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted from voxelwise WMH probability and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration. Our model with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) achieves a balanced accuracy score of 0.74/0.67/0.62, and root brier score of 0.65/0.72/0.74 in the Deep WMH and balanced accuracy of 0.74/0.73/0.71 and root brier score of 0.64/0.66/0.68 in the Periventricular region. We further demonstrate that stochastic UQ techniques with high sample diversity can improve the detection of poor quality segmentations.

<title>A Progressive Image Restoration Network for High-order Degradation Imaging in Remote Sensing</title>

Abstract: Recently, deep learning methods have gained remarkable achievements in the field of image restoration for remote sensing (RS). However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.

Abstract: We introduce the spiked mixture model (SMM) to address the problem of estimating a set of signals from many randomly scaled and noisy observations. Subsequently, we design a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to recover all parameters of the SMM. Numerical experiments show that in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, and for data types where the SMM is relevant, SMM surpasses the more traditional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in terms of signal recovery performance. The broad relevance of the SMM and its corresponding EM recovery algorithm is demonstrated by applying the technique to different data types. The first case study is a biomedical research application, utilizing an imaging mass spectrometry dataset to explore the molecular content of a rat brain tissue section at micrometer scale. The second case study demonstrates SMM performance in a computer vision application, segmenting a hyperspectral imaging dataset into underlying patterns. While the measurement modalities differ substantially, in both case studies SMM is shown to recover signals that were missed by traditional methods such as k-means clustering and GMM.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become ubiquitous when deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), as it can address typical limitations such as generating hallucinated or outdated information. However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning large language models (LLMs). Yet its reliance on a singular reward model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning. However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO achieves balanced performance across diverse preferences, outperforming or matching existing models with significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.

Abstract: This work suggests faster and space-efficient index construction algorithms for LSH for Euclidean distance (\textit{a.k.a.}~\ELSH) and cosine similarity (\textit{a.k.a.}~\SRP). The index construction step of these LSHs relies on grouping data points into several bins of hash tables based on their hashcode. To generate an $m$-dimensional hashcode of the $d$-dimensional data point, these LSHs first project the data point onto a $d$-dimensional random Gaussian vector and then discretise the resulting inner product. The time and space complexity of both \ELSH~and \SRP~for computing an $m$-sized hashcode of a $d$-dimensional vector is $O(md)$, which becomes impractical for large values of $m$ and $d$. To overcome this problem, we propose two alternative LSH hashcode generation algorithms, both for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, namely, \CSELSH, \HCSELSH~and \CSSRP, \HCSSRP, respectively. \CSELSH~and \CSSRP~are based on count sketch \cite{count_sketch} and \HCSELSH~and \HCSSRP~utilize higher-order count sketch \cite{shi2019higher}. These proposals significantly reduce the hashcode computation time from $O(md)$ to $O(d)$. Additionally, both \CSELSH~and \CSSRP~reduce the space complexity from $O(md)$ to $O(d)$; ~and \HCSELSH, \HCSSRP~ reduce the space complexity from $O(md)$ to $O(N \sqrt[N]{d})$ respectively, where $N\geq 1$ denotes the size of the input/reshaped tensor. Our proposals are backed by strong mathematical guarantees, and we validate their performance through simulations on various real-world datasets.

Abstract: Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates to achieve the quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits. Specifically, we design machine learning models to find good donor candidates optimized on MaxCut and apply their parameters to MIS acceptors. Our experimental results show that such parameter transfer can significantly reduce the number of optimization iterations required while achieving comparable approximation ratios.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839, outperforming SVM with an AUC of 0.762. At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using Neural General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can generate 100 simulation days in ~8 minutes with a single Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July to November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990 to 2023 (r=~0.7), suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings, the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations with the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p<0.1) and basin-wide accumulated cyclone energy (p<0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences is crucial for urban planning, yet current approaches often combine responses from multi-cultural populations, obscuring demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants with balanced demographics from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), reveals demographic- and personality-based differences across six traditional indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring, depressing) and four new ones (live nearby, walk, cycle, green). Location-based sentiments further shape these preferences. Machine learning models trained on existing global datasets tend to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to human responses, underscoring the need for local context. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality traits.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is an important problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object benchmarks to showcase that it performs competitively with the state-of-the-art, while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand priors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

<title>Task-Specific Generative Dataset Distillation with Difficulty-Guided Sampling</title>

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.

<div> Keywords: Brain-computer interfaces, Uncertainty quantification, Machine Learning classifier, Motor Imagery, Deep Learning<br />
Summary: <br />
The study compares the uncertainty quantification ability of different BCI classifiers, including CSP-LDA, MDRM, Deep Ensembles, Direct Uncertainty Quantification, and CNNs. It found that CSP-LDA and MDRM provide the best uncertainty estimates, with MDRM being initially underconfident but improved with MDRM-T through Temperature Scaling. While Deep Ensembles and CNNs offer superior classifications, they exhibit overconfidence in comparison to CSP-LDA and MDRM. All models successfully differentiate between easy and difficult estimates, enabling the rejection of ambiguous samples to enhance the accuracy of Motor Imagery BCIs. This research highlights the importance of uncertainty quantification in improving the reliability and performance of BCIs for real-world applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

<title>SAMO: A Lightweight Sharpness-Aware Approach for Multi-Task Optimization with Joint Global-Local Perturbation</title>

<div> Keywords: Multi-task learning, Sharpness-aware minimization, Task conflicts, Global-local perturbation, Efficiency <br />
Summary: 
Multi-task learning (MTL) allows a single model to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, improving data efficiency and reducing computation costs. However, a key challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts, where gradients from different tasks differ, impacting model performance. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) addresses this issue by reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Integrating SAM into MTL poses challenges in combining global and local information efficiently. To tackle this, SAMO is proposed, a lightweight Sharpness-Aware Multi-task Optimization approach that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. SAMO approximates local perturbations using forward passes and normalizes them layerwise for improved efficiency. Extensive experiments on multi-task benchmarks showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of SAMO in mitigating task conflicts.Code for SAMO is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts, where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and individual task gradients-referred to as global and local information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover, directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight \textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Abstract: In recent years, various artificial intelligence-based surrogate models have been proposed to provide rapid manufacturability predictions of material forming processes. However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically built with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability to capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a permutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based surrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study developed a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U Net-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate predictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming timesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model temporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample mechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface' contact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements in computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN model was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot forming case study using aluminium alloys. Results demonstrate that the RUGNN model provides accurate deformation predictions closely matching ground truth FE simulations and outperforming several baseline GNN architectures. Model tuning was also performed to identify suitable hyperparameters, training strategies, and input feature representations. These results demonstrate that RUGNN is a reliable approach to support sheet material forming design by enabling accurate manufacturability predictions.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model, SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85) and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal, explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in deep learning for virtual sensing. CMCO combines Monte Carlo dropout with split conformal prediction in a DeepONet architecture to provide calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals for spatially resolved uncertainty estimates. It enables efficient and reliable UQ in operator learning across diverse domains without retraining or custom loss design. The method achieves near-nominal empirical coverage in applications such as turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation, even in challenging settings with strong spatial gradients. CMCO offers a plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, facilitating real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, CMCO establishes a foundation for scalable, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains. Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the \emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive approaches to numerical relativity.

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Summary:
Diffusion models, including Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model and Multinomial Diffusion Model, outperformed other generative models in industrial tire architecture generation tasks. The evaluation considered three scenarios: unconditional generation of designs, component-conditioned generation from partial observations, and dimension-constrained generation fulfilling specific requirements. A new approach called categorical inpainting was introduced to allow discrete diffusion models to handle conditional scenarios. Results showed that masking-trained Variational Autoencoder performed better than the multimodal variant MMVAE+ in component-conditioned metrics. Within the diffusion family, Multinomial Diffusion Model excelled in-distribution, while Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model showed better generalization to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints. The evaluation utilized specialized metrics focused on spatial coherence, component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity tailored to industrial needs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep generative models proliferate across the AI landscape, industrial practitioners still face critical yet unanswered questions about which deep generative models best suit complex manufacturing design tasks. This work addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models (Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation (reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii) dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence, component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics, and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.

Summary:
Various practical metrics such as dropout robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures are introduced to forecast grokking behavior in neural networks. Grokking refers to the phenomenon where an increase in test accuracy is observed after improvement in training accuracy. The Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) is used to estimate the neural network's resilience to noise during inference, showing a local maximum in test accuracy variance during grokking. The percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while embeddings tend towards a bimodal distribution independent of initialization, correlating with observed cosine similarity patterns. These metrics provide valuable insights into the origin and behavior of grokking, helping understand the delayed generalization phenomenon in neural networks.

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally, the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries. These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and behaviour of grokking.

The paper introduces a novel protocol for privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation in Federated Learning (FL) by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). The protocol allows clients to generate proofs of their local loss being below a specified threshold, eliminating the need to share raw loss values. The approach, implemented without external APIs, includes modules for FL simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experiments on MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets using CNN and MLP models. Evaluation focuses on computational overhead, communication costs, and verifiability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized data without exposing raw data. However, the evaluation phase in FL may leak sensitive information through shared performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol that incorporates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation for FL. Instead of revealing raw loss values, clients generate a succinct proof asserting that their local loss is below a predefined threshold. Our approach is implemented without reliance on external APIs, using self-contained modules for federated learning simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experimental evaluation on both the MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets. We focus on a threshold-based proof for a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (for MNIST) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (for HAR), and evaluate the approach in terms of computational overhead, communication cost, and verifiability.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new computational approach, Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics (STAGED), which integrates agent-based modeling with deep learning to model intercellular communication and its impact on gene regulatory networks. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted rules, but STAGED uses data-driven approaches to learn complex cellular dynamics. By representing genes as vertices and interactions as edges in a graph, the model dynamically learns interaction strengths through an attention mechanism. Trained to match continuous trajectories from spatial transcriptomics data, STAGED captures both intercellular and intracellular interactions, providing a more adaptive and accurate representation of cellular dynamics. This innovative approach shows promise in understanding cellular organization and dynamics in various tissues, shedding light on crucial aspects of cellular behavior and function. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The advent of single-cell technology has significantly improved our understanding of cellular states and subpopulations in various tissues under normal and diseased conditions by employing data-driven approaches such as clustering and trajectory inference. However, these methods consider cells as independent data points of population distributions. With spatial transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED) integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate representation of cellular dynamics.

Summary: 

- The study explores the compositional structure of linear layers by utilizing geometric primitives, particularly bivectors and rotors, which encode oriented planes in Clifford algebra.
- A differentiable algorithm is introduced to decompose linear transformations into products of rotors, requiring significantly fewer parameters compared to traditional dense matrices.
- The rotor-based layers derived from this approach demonstrate comparable performance to established baselines like block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations in key, query, and value projections within LLM attention layers.
- The research sheds light on how fundamental geometric primitives can interact and combine to form more complex functions within deep learning models.
- This algebraic perspective offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of large models and the potential for enhancing their capabilities through a deeper understanding of low-level building blocks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into higher-level functions within deep models.

Summary: <br />
- Coreset selection methods are effective in reducing training data size while maintaining model performance.
- It is crucial to understand how dataset reduction methods impact biases in the data and subsequent model performance.
- This study analyzes the implications of data selection on spurious bias levels in selected coresets and model robustness.
- Experimental analysis across various benchmarks shows nuanced interactions between sample difficulty, bias alignment, and model robustness.
- Selecting coresets using certain sample characterization scores may lower the risk of exacerbating bias, but does not guarantee downstream model robustness. <div>
arXiv:2507.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning. However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty, and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes. Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

Railway traffic disruptions due to leaf-fall cause significant financial losses for the UK rail industry. Current methods for predicting leaf-fall timings are limited in scalability and reliability. This study proposes a prediction system using an LSTM network trained on ground-truth data and satellite information to forecast leaf-fall start and end times. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting leaf-fall onset and 9.31 days for predicting its end. By improving upon existing methodologies, this model offers potential benefits for optimizing mitigation measures in the railway sector and enhancing our understanding of ecological systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Preference-based MDPs (PbMDPs) for episodic tabular Markov decision processes with adversarial preferences, focusing on reward functions determined by Borda scores. A regret lower bound is established for PbMDPs with Borda scores, building on a lower bound for episodic MDPs with adversarial losses. Algorithms achieving a regret bound of order T^(2/3) are developed: a global optimization approach based on online linear optimization and a policy optimization algorithm. The global optimization approach achieves a regret bound roughly proportional to (H^2 S^2 K)^(1/3) T^(2/3), while the policy optimization algorithm's regret is approximately bounded by (H^6 S K^5)^(1/3) T^(2/3) under known transitions, with extensions to unknown transitions. These advancements address the computational inefficiency and large number of states in PbMDPs with Borda scores, providing more efficient solutions for decision-making under adversarial preferences. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.11706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs (PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the numerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead observes preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices being compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the reward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a regret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we present a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ for episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is the number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret lower bound of $\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda scores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that achieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global optimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all occupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from suboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and computational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization algorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the unknown-transition setting.

The article introduces FLEX, a Graph Generation Model framework that enhances link prediction performance in out-of-distribution scenarios by ensuring structural-alignment between sample distributions. FLEX leverages structurally-conditioned graph generation and adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN.

arXiv:2507.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models (GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this, GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1) structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the effects of graph data augmentation on link structures.

Summary:
This paper explores the challenges and benefits of global load forecasting in power transmission networks. Traditional local forecasting models face limitations such as overfitting and data drift, while global forecasting models offer advantages in scalability and prediction generalizability. The study investigates the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity on forecasting accuracy. It finds that global target-transforming models outperform local models, particularly when incorporating global features and clustering techniques. Feature-transforming models struggle with balancing local and global dynamics, requiring time series clustering to manage data heterogeneity effectively. The research also highlights the importance of globalization in peak load forecasting and potential applications for hierarchical forecasting. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of global forecasting models in enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness in power transmission networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem. These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

The paper introduces a new approach called the GEE-powered GNN (GG) that enhances the training of Graph Neural Networks by using high-quality initial node features generated through the one-hot graph encoder embedding method. GG outperforms standard GNNs in node clustering tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and faster convergence. Additionally, an enhanced variant, GG-C, is proposed for node classification, which combines the outputs of GG and GEE to outperform existing baselines. The results demonstrate the significance of structured and informed feature initialization in maximizing the potential of GNNs for both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines. These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.

Summary:<br /><br /> This study introduces the integration of Conformal Prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) to quantify uncertainty in nonlinear dynamical system models. Three applications of Conformal Prediction with E-SINDy are explored: uncertainty quantification in time series prediction, model selection based on library feature importance, and uncertainty quantification of identified model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. The methods are demonstrated on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and chaotic dynamical systems, showing the ability to achieve target coverage for time series forecasting, effectively quantify feature importance, and produce robust uncertainty intervals for model coefficients. The integration of Conformal Prediction with E-SINDy provides reliable uncertainty quantification even under non-Gaussian noise, improving the reliability and applicability of SINDy models in safety-critical applications. <div>

Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability, particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1) quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting, effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.

Torsional-GFN is a newly introduced conditional GFlowNet that focuses on efficiently sampling molecular conformations in drug discovery applications. This method utilizes generative machine learning techniques to sample rotations of torsion angles based on a molecular graph and its local structure. The model is trained using a reward function to sample conformations proportional to the Boltzmann distribution of multiple molecules with a single model.

arXiv:2507.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution, using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local structure into the GFlowNet model.

arXiv:2507.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the efficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building on previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition (CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the family of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable 'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive pairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual stream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and aims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs. Using answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found that 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The effectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more pronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.

Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry. Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

CLID-MU utilizes the alignment of data structures across different feature spaces to evaluate model performance and guide training. By leveraging the consistency of clean samples and the disruption caused by noisy samples, CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments on benchmark datasets with varying degrees of label noise. The proposed approach does not rely on a clean labeled meta-dataset, making it a practical solution for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. The code for CLID-MU is available on GitHub for further exploration and application.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset, which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU). CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training. Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2507.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure conditioning.

The system integrates semantic understanding, reinforcement learning, and human feedback to achieve intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. It supports complex category structures with fine-grained subcategorization and offers multiple processing modes for flexibility. Inspired by category theory, MNIST-Gen models data transformation stages as composable morphisms, enhancing clarity and modularity. Two novel datasets, Tree-MNIST and Food-MNIST, were generated and benchmarked to demonstrate the utility of MNIST-Gen in producing task-specific evaluation data.

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant. Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming, legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics, enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes: individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and \textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

Summary: 
The article introduces HyperEvent, a framework for dynamic link prediction in continuous-time dynamic graphs. It reframes the task as hyper-event recognition, focusing on capturing structural cohesion of composite hyper-events. HyperEvent constructs an association sequence using event correlation vectors to quantify pairwise dependencies between query events and historical events. By evaluating the query event's potential as a valid hyper-event with historical events, HyperEvent predicts the occurrence of the query event. The framework outperforms existing methods on most datasets and introduces an efficient parallel training algorithm for scalability. Experiments demonstrate HyperEvent's superior accuracy and efficiency, achieving a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on the Flight dataset while using only 10.17% of the training time. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction in continuous-time dynamic graphs is a fundamental task for modeling evolving complex systems. Existing node-centric and event-centric methods focus on individual interactions or atomic states, failing to capture the structural cohesion of composite hyper-events, groups of causally related events. To address this, we propose HyperEvent, a framework reframing dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition. Central to HyperEvent is the dynamic construction of an association sequence using event correlation vectors. These vectors quantify pairwise dependencies between the query event and relevant historical events, thereby characterizing the structural cohesion of a potential hyper-event. The framework predicts the occurrence of the query event by evaluating whether it collectively forms a valid hyper-event with these historical events. Notably, HyperEvent outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 4 out of 5 datasets in the official leaderboard. For scalability, we further introduce an efficient parallel training algorithm that segments large event streams to enable concurrent training. Experiments validate HyperEvent's superior accuracy and efficiency on large-scale graphs. Among which HyperEvent achieves a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank over state-of-the-art baseline on the large-scale Flight dataset while utilizing only 10.17% of the training time.

Summary:
Protenix-Mini, a lightweight model for protein structure prediction, addresses the challenge of balancing efficiency and accuracy by incorporating a few-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampler to reduce computational overhead in the diffusion module. Through architectural pruning in the Protenix framework, redundant components are eliminated while maintaining high prediction fidelity. The model replaces the traditional MSA module with an ESM module, reducing preprocessing time. Despite its streamlined design, Protenix-Mini achieves high accuracy, with only a slight decrease compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes it an ideal choice for applications requiring efficient protein structure prediction in resource-constrained environments. <div>
arXiv:2507.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process, Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

<div> bandit, generalized linear, contextual, non-linear, optimization
Summary: 
The article discusses the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem in the context of contextual multi-armed bandit frameworks. GLBs extend the classical linear model by incorporating a non-linear link function, allowing for modeling a wide range of reward distributions. Existing methods for GLBs often face challenges in balancing computational and statistical efficiency. The proposed algorithm in the paper addresses these challenges by achieving nearly optimal regret bounds with low time and space complexities per round. The algorithm is based on a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD) estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis leveraging the concept of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis demonstrates that the OMD estimator, despite its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to maximum likelihood estimation, making it a jointly efficient optimistic method. <div>
arXiv:2507.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD) estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator, even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient optimistic method.

<br />Summary:
The research introduces OrdShap, a novel method for attributing features in sequential deep learning models. Existing techniques assume fixed feature ordering, making it challenging to separate the effects of feature values and positions within input sequences. OrdShap quantifies how a model's predictions change when feature positions are permuted, providing a clearer understanding of feature importance. The method establishes a game-theoretic connection with Sanchez-Bergantiños values, offering a theoretically grounded approach to position-sensitive attribution. Empirical results from various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OrdShap in capturing both feature value and position attributions, leading to enhanced insights into model behavior. <div>
arXiv:2507.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential deep learning models excel in domains with temporal or sequential dependencies, but their complexity necessitates post-hoc feature attribution methods for understanding their predictions. While existing techniques quantify feature importance, they inherently assume fixed feature ordering - conflating the effects of (1) feature values and (2) their positions within input sequences. To address this gap, we introduce OrdShap, a novel attribution method that disentangles these effects by quantifying how a model's predictions change in response to permuting feature position. We establish a game-theoretic connection between OrdShap and Sanchez-Berganti\~nos values, providing a theoretically grounded approach to position-sensitive attribution. Empirical results from health, natural language, and synthetic datasets highlight OrdShap's effectiveness in capturing feature value and feature position attributions, and provide deeper insight into model behavior.

<div> Keywords: platform integration, ride-hailing, Discount Express service, dynamic management, deep deterministic policy gradient

Summary: 
The study focuses on managing drivers' acceptance of Discount Express services in ride-hailing platforms to improve matching efficiency. It addresses the challenges of limited historical data and high stochasticity by proposing a policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The framework includes a refiner module for early training performance, a convolutional long short-term memory network for capturing complex patterns, and a prioritized experience replay mechanism for efficient learning. A simulator based on real-world data validates the effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG, showing superior learning efficiency and reduced training losses in the early stages. The study highlights the importance of platform integration and dynamic management in the evolving ride-hailing market to meet passenger preferences and increase driver participation in Discount Express services. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of platform integration has emerged as an effective solution to mitigate market fragmentation by consolidating multiple ride-hailing platforms into a single application. To address heterogeneous passenger preferences, third-party integrators provide Discount Express service delivered by express drivers at lower trip fares. For the individual platform, encouraging broader participation of drivers in Discount Express services has the potential to expand the accessible demand pool and improve matching efficiency, but often at the cost of reduced profit margins. This study aims to dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express from the perspective of individual platforms. The lack of historical data under the new business model necessitates online learning. However, early-stage exploration through trial and error can be costly in practice, highlighting the need for reliable early-stage performance in real-world deployment. To address these challenges, this study formulates the decision regarding the proportion of drivers' acceptance behavior as a continuous control task. In response to the high stochasticity, the opaque matching mechanisms employed by third-party integrator, and the limited availability of historical data, we propose a policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The proposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance during the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term memory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and adopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning efficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG. Numerical experiments demonstrate that pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces early-stage training losses.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the Meta-IR framework for addressing imbalanced regression problems. It trains meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline comprising resampling strategies and learning models for each task in a zero-shot manner. Two formulations, Independent and Chained, are proposed, with the Chained scenario showing superior performance by considering the relationship between learning algorithms and resampling strategies. Meta-IR outperformed AutoML frameworks and baseline configurations of learning and resampling algorithms. The code, data, and experiment details are available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Imbalanced problems are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and are extensively explored in classification tasks. However, they also present challenges for regression tasks due to the rarity of certain target values. A common alternative is to employ balancing algorithms in preprocessing to address dataset imbalance. However, due to the variety of resampling methods and learning models, determining the optimal solution requires testing many combinations. Furthermore, the learning model, dataset, and evaluation metric affect the best strategies. This work proposes the Meta-learning for Imbalanced Regression (Meta-IR) framework, which diverges from existing literature by training meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline composed of the resampling strategy and learning model per task in a zero-shot fashion. The meta-classifiers are trained using a set of meta-features to learn how to map the meta-features to the classes indicating the best pipeline. We propose two formulations: Independent and Chained. Independent trains the meta-classifiers to separately indicate the best learning algorithm and resampling strategy. Chained involves a sequential procedure where the output of one meta-classifier is used as input for another to model intrinsic relationship factors. The Chained scenario showed superior performance, suggesting a relationship between the learning algorithm and the resampling strategy per task. Compared with AutoML frameworks, Meta-IR obtained better results. Moreover, compared with baselines of six learning algorithms and six resampling algorithms plus no resampling, totaling 42 (6 X 7) configurations, Meta-IR outperformed all of them.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epidemic failure of replicability across empirical science and machine learning has recently motivated the formal study of replicable learning algorithms [Impagliazzo et al. (2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from a fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the design of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood. In contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control settings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with a shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative model of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch setting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only $\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a generative model jumps to $\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the substantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key question in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration inherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable RL even possible?
  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular MDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our main result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging the gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a matching $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under the common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in the episodic setting of $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of our algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a machine learning-accelerated optimization framework for RF power amplifier design. By combining MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling with CatBoost gradient boosting, the framework efficiently explores multidimensional parameter spaces, reducing simulation requirements by 65% while maintaining high accuracy of $\pm0.3$ to $\pm0.4$ dBm. Approximately 35% of critical simulation points are selected strategically, allowing for faster design iterations without compromising accuracy. The framework processes ADS netlists, conducts harmonic balance simulations on a reduced dataset, and trains a CatBoost model to predict P2dB performance across the entire design space. Validation across 15 PA operating modes shows an average $R^2$ of 0.901, ranking parameter combinations by their likelihood of meeting target specifications. The integrated solution achieves a significant reduction in simulation time (58.24% to 77.78%) through automated GUI-based workflows, facilitating rapid design iterations for production RF circuits. <div>

Summary: 
The study introduces Kevin, a model trained with multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. The iterative nature of writing GPU kernels is challenging but crucial for AI efficiency, making it an ideal environment for applying RL. Kevin addresses challenges such as learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns. In evaluations, Kevin outperformed its base model, improving correctness of generated kernels from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to 1.10x. It also surpassed frontier models like o4-mini. The model's behavior was studied across test-time scaling axes, revealing that scaling serial refinement is more beneficial than parallel sampling. Notably, providing more refinement turns led to a higher rate of improvement in Kevin's performance. <div>

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems' efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns. We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to 1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini (0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of improvement.

<div> Pruning Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Online Feature Extractor Network, Stochastic Optimization, Sparsity-Promoting Regularization<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach to integrating training and pruning in reinforcement learning algorithms using Online Feature Extractor Networks (OFENets). By introducing variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables, the proposed XiNet networks are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights. Regularization terms promote the convergence of variational parameters to 0, leading to the permanent pruning of inactive network structures. A cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme tailored to DenseNet architecture in OFENets effectively combines RL objectives and network compression, optimizing network performance and efficiency. Evaluation on MuJoCo benchmarks and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent demonstrates significant pruning potential in OFENets with minimal performance loss. Results suggest that pruning large networks during training leads to more efficient and higher performing RL agents compared to training smaller networks from scratch.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo) and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Summary: 
Graph fraud detection is a critical area of research due to the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in modeling complex relationships in multimodal data. However, existing methods often overlook the semantic cues in raw textual information. This paper introduces the Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection (MLED) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract knowledge from textual data for improved fraud detection. The framework includes a type-level enhancer and a relation-level enhancer to differentiate fraudsters and enhance their importance in various relations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MLED outperforms existing methods in graph fraud detection. MLED serves as a versatile framework that can enhance the performance of current graph fraud detection techniques.

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven Sample Expansion (DUSE) to address the issue of data scarcity in automatic modulation recognition (AMR) tasks. Traditional deep neural networks for AMR require large amounts of labeled data, which can be difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. DUSE utilizes an uncertainty scoring function to filter useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs active learning to continuously refine the scoring process. Experiment results show that DUSE outperforms 8 coreset selection baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Additionally, DUSE demonstrates strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models. This framework provides a promising solution for improving AMR performance without the need for manual data collection or costly expert annotation. <div>

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

<div> Keywords: Human feedback, granular feedback, regularized averaging, feedback granularity, social attitudes 
Summary: 
Granular human feedback is valuable for applications like AI training and recommender systems. Regularized averaging is commonly used to estimate population feedback distribution from a limited group. However, as feedback granularity increases, improved methods outperform regularized averaging. Empirical analysis on social attitudes shows that with binary feedback, sophistication does not significantly decrease the number of individuals needed for accurate predictions. In contrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match regularized averaging performance with only half the individuals. This research suggests that as feedback granularity increases, more advanced methods can enhance population feedback distribution predictions, enabling more efficient and accurate analysis of human feedback data. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human feedback is increasingly used across diverse applications like training AI models, developing recommender systems, and measuring public opinion -- with granular feedback often being preferred over binary feedback for its greater informativeness. While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's distribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals, cost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to approximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the empirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As we will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.
  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using feedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback granularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of regularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more sophisticated than regularized averaging.
  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this pattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the number of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By contrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance of regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a unified theoretical framework for replay-based continual learning (CL) methods. The analysis includes hypothesis-based bounds that demonstrate the benefits of utilizing limited exemplars from previous tasks alongside current task data for improved generalization and reduced catastrophic forgetting. Prediction-based bounds offer computationally tractable upper bounds on generalization gap using low-dimensional variables. The analysis is applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) used as a representative method. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the derived bounds in capturing generalization dynamics in replay-based CL settings. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for acquiring knowledge from sequential tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Although many CL methods have been proposed to show impressive empirical performance, the theoretical understanding of their generalization behavior remains limited, particularly for replay-based approaches. In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical framework for replay-based CL, deriving a series of information-theoretic bounds that explicitly characterize how the memory buffer interacts with the current task to affect generalization. Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds reveal that utilizing the limited exemplars of previous tasks alongside the current task data, rather than exhaustive replay, facilitates improved generalization while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our prediction-based bounds yield tighter and computationally tractable upper bounds of the generalization gap through the use of low-dimensional variables. Our analysis is general and broadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL settings.

<div> Keywords: urban mobility, data-driven approach, conditional generative adversarial networks, simulation, adaptive parameters<br />
Summary:<br />
This study introduces a new data-driven approach for simulating origin-destination mobility flows in urban areas. Existing models often overlook evolving factors such as changes in population density and land use, limiting their accuracy for future projections. The proposed method leverages adaptive factors, such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend historical data with these parameters. This allows for rapid mobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions of interest. The approach was successfully applied to mobile phone data from Singapore and demonstrated promising performance compared to existing methods. By incorporating dynamic factors and adaptive parameters, this approach provides a more accurate and flexible way to simulate human mobility patterns for urban planning and transportation optimization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobility patterns of people in cities evolve alongside changes in land use and population. This makes it crucial for urban planners to simulate and analyze human mobility patterns for purposes such as transportation optimization and sustainable urban development. Existing generative models borrowed from machine learning rely heavily on historical trajectories and often overlook evolving factors like changes in population density and land use. Mechanistic approaches incorporate population density and facility distribution but assume static scenarios, limiting their utility for future projections where historical data for calibration is unavailable. This study introduces a novel, data-driven approach for generating origin-destination mobility flows tailored to simulated urban scenarios. Our method leverages adaptive factors such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and it utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend historical data with these adaptive parameters. The approach facilitates rapid mobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions of interest, without requiring extensive calibration data or complex behavior modeling. The promising performance of our approach is demonstrated by its application to mobile phone data from Singapore, and by its comparison with existing methods.

<div> symmetries, network primitives, representational alignment, functional form choices, interpretability <br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a new methodology, Spotlight Resonance, to determine representational alignment in networks. It shows that algebraic symmetries of network primitives can predict task-agnostic structure in representations. By altering activation functions in an ablation study, it is revealed that representations tend to become discrete with permutation-equivariant symmetries, while remaining continuous with orthogonal-equivariant definitions. This highlights the impact of functional form choices on inducing unintended inductive biases that lead to quantisation effects in representations. The study proposes a causal model for the formation of discrete representations and suggests a link to interpretability phenomena such as grandmother neurons and Superposition. The research also indicates that quantisation leads to increased reconstruction error, underscoring the potential drawbacks of representation discretisation. As a result, this work offers valuable insights into the influence of functional form on representation structures and their implications for interpretability in neural networks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology for determining representational alignment, developed upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Using this, it is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong predictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and arrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the activation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in representations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of otherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide several insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.

<div> informativeness gap, predictive models, decision tasks, calibration, measurement

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of informativeness gap, which quantifies the advantage one predictive model has over another in various decision-making tasks. It expands on existing notions such as U-Calibration and Calibration Decision Loss, providing a more comprehensive framework. A dual characterization of the informativeness gap is presented, leading to an informativeness measure akin to the earth mover's distance for prediction distributions. This measure is shown to be complete, sound, and efficiently estimable in prediction-only scenarios. Additionally, novel combinatorial results are uncovered when applying the measure to perfectly calibrated predictors. <div>
arXiv:2507.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, decision-makers must choose between multiple predictive models that may all be miscalibrated. Which model (i.e., predictor) is more "useful" in downstream decision tasks? To answer this, our first contribution introduces the notion of the informativeness gap between any two predictors, defined as the maximum normalized payoff advantage one predictor offers over the other across all decision-making tasks. Our framework strictly generalizes several existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration Decision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its calibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51, Bla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated. Our second contribution is a dual characterization of the informativeness gap, which gives rise to a natural informativeness measure that can be viewed as a relaxed variant of the earth mover's distance (EMD) between two prediction distributions. We show that this measure satisfies natural desiderata: it is complete and sound, and it can be estimated sample-efficiently in the prediction-only access setting. Along the way, we also obtain novel combinatorial structural results when applying this measure to perfectly calibrated predictors.

Summary:<br />
Advancements in wireless technologies drive growth in spectrum scarcity. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) addresses this issue through spectrum sensing and sharing. Machine learning (ML) models can improve spectrum sensing but face limitations in centralized systems. Federated Learning (FL) offers a distributed ML-based approach to overcome privacy and bandwidth challenges. A semi-supervised FL approach allows training on unlabeled data in spectrum sensing. Security vulnerabilities in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS) from data poisoning attacks are addressed. Existing defenses are inadequate, so a novel defense mechanism inspired by vaccination is proposed. Experiments show FLSS achieves high accuracy on unlabeled data and is robust against data poisoning attacks, even with malicious participants. <div>

Abstract: Advancements in wireless and mobile technologies, including 5G advanced and the envisioned 6G, are driving exponential growth in wireless devices. However, this rapid expansion exacerbates spectrum scarcity, posing a critical challenge. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)--which relies on sensing and dynamically sharing spectrum--has emerged as an essential solution to address this issue. While machine learning (ML) models hold significant potential for improving spectrum sensing, their adoption in centralized ML-based DSA systems is limited by privacy concerns, bandwidth constraints, and regulatory challenges. To overcome these limitations, distributed ML-based approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) offer promising alternatives. This work addresses two key challenges in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS). First, the scarcity of labeled data for training FL models in practical spectrum sensing scenarios is tackled with a semi-supervised FL approach, combined with energy detection, enabling model training on unlabeled datasets. Second, we examine the security vulnerabilities of FLSS, focusing on the impact of data poisoning attacks. Our analysis highlights the shortcomings of existing majority-based defenses in countering such attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel defense mechanism inspired by vaccination, which effectively mitigates data poisoning attacks without relying on majority-based assumptions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our solutions, demonstrating that FLSS can achieve near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets and maintain Byzantine robustness against both targeted and untargeted data poisoning attacks, even when a significant proportion of participants are malicious.

The method treats fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold, addressing overparametrization and providing optimal initialization strategies within a unified framework.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain, including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable, geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting. The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3 delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8 to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches, FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on 1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model- and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a single GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly resolution in under 20 seconds. Its computational efficiency, medium-range probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial assemblies or multi-modal imaging, challenge current generative modeling techniques. Existing Multi-component Variational AutoEncoders typically rely on simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically, our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships, demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results indicate that the GMRF MCVAE is especially suited for practical applications demanding robust and realistic modeling of multi-component coherence

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA, forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich, high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/UrbanRadio3D.

Abstract: Unsupervised classification is a fundamental machine learning problem. Real-world data often contain imperfections, characterized by uncertainty and imprecision, which are not well handled by traditional methods. Evidential clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, addresses these challenges. This paper explores the underexplored problem of explaining evidential clustering results, which is crucial for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Our analysis shows that, in the general case, representativity is a necessary and sufficient condition for decision trees to serve as abductive explainers. Building on the concept of representativity, we generalize this idea to accommodate partial labeling through utility functions. These functions enable the representation of "tolerable" mistakes, leading to the definition of evidential mistakeness as explanation cost and the construction of explainers tailored to evidential classifiers. Finally, we propose the Iterative Evidential Mistake Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which provides interpretable and cautious decision tree explanations for evidential clustering functions. We validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world data. Taking into account the decision-maker's preferences, we were able to provide an explanation that was satisfactory up to 93% of the time.

<title>Selective Quantization Tuning for ONNX Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues, quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the original model.

<title>Physics-Informed Linear Model (PILM): Analytical Representations and Application to Crustal Strain Rate Estimation</title>

Abstract: Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs), and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.

<title>Optimizers Qualitatively Alter Solutions And We Should Leverage This</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12224</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the nonlinear nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one can not guarantee convergence to a unique global minimum of the loss when using optimizers relying only on local information, such as SGD. Indeed, this was a primary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early days of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed this skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows that sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit well-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This success has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model for learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of required iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We argue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another perspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the optimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative properties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will encode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class of models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of encoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community should aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as aim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain properties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their convergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our understanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we converge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a critical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping model outcomes.

<title>Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws</title>

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

<title>A Framework for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes with Neural Network Parameters</title>

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure. Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

<title>RegCL: Continual Adaptation of Segment Anything Model via Model Merging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation. This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability. To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required. Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

<title>PROL : Rehearsal Free Continual Learning in Streaming Data via Prompt Online Learning</title>

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput. For further study, the source code of our method is available at https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

<title>Heat Kernel Goes Topological</title>

arXiv:2507.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological neural networks have emerged as powerful successors of graph neural networks. However, they typically involve higher-order message passing, which incurs significant computational expense. We circumvent this issue with a novel topological framework that introduces a Laplacian operator on combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration into modern transformer-based architectures.
  Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency. Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning by providing expressive yet scalable representations, thereby opening up exciting avenues for molecular classification and property prediction tasks.

arXiv:2507.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds on the asymptotic sample-complexity for RL within the infinite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting that are sharper than those in existing literature. The premise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each other, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when learning the $\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of 'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\epsilon$-optimal value of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the $\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of transitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity have values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number of samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs constructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce the sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \log A)$ timesteps, where $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend these results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a PAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with showing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against prior work in an experimental setting.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns regarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and robustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in interpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains computationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence. Previous efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable memory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement sharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which leads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$ Flash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient inference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference experiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional robustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays achieve $96\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database, while maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model validated only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\%$ device threshold variation, compared to a $45.3\%$ drop for traditional decision trees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's trustworthiness and efficiency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve. Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level of accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different versions of Llama and Qwen to generate and verify solutions.

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover, temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting, and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P). Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available at https://github.com/nutig/RayTracing

While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits, existing neural implementations either rely on "targeted losses" that do not guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally expensive post-hoc "fluctuations" for multi-parameter settings. We propose Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly into the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but a small "targeting" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in estimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal estimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting gradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits classical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric efficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment effects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces bias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators and prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable pathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for complex multi-parameter targets.

<title>A Bayesian Incentive Mechanism for Poison-Resilient Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model. Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3 percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries. This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light, budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.

Abstract: In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition functions, namely the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these two acquisition functions. In experiments on synthetic and empirical tasks, including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture size search, we show that combining our stopping rule with the PBGI acquisition function consistently matches or outperforms other acquisition-function--stopping-rule pairs in terms of cost-adjusted simple regret, a metric capturing trade-offs between solution quality and cumulative evaluation cost.

Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) unlock huge benefits in innovation, personalization, privacy, and democratization. However, their core advantage - modifiability - opens the door to systemic risks: bad actors can trivially subvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This leads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a model with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those safeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for state-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical and cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from two families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to 405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that the safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous capabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the Safety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve as an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation for developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome contributions to the toolkit from the community.

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data

Abstract: Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, and many in the robotics community are looking for ways to contribute. This paper presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation, industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture, building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception, control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate priorities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

<title>JSQA: Speech Quality Assessment with Perceptually-Inspired Contrastive Pretraining Based on JND Audio Pairs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11636</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score (MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node (LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP' achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85 +/- 0.05.

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains. Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over 80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline. Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior analysis across various fields.

<title>Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662</link>

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, a new instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train models on static, rule-based data, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on synthetic linter-generated data to support easy-to-hard generalization, enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining. To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize. Our results show that MetaLint improves generalization to unseen PEP idioms, achieving a 70.37% F-score on idiom detection with the highest recall (70.43%) among all evaluated models. It also achieves 26.73% on localization, competitive for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art models like o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality analysis.

Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable in-context learning capabilities, adapting to new tasks without parameter updates. While this phenomenon has been successfully modeled as implicit Bayesian inference, recent empirical findings reveal a fundamental contradiction: transformers systematically violate the martingale property, a cornerstone requirement of Bayesian updating on exchangeable data. This violation challenges the theoretical foundations underlying uncertainty quantification in critical applications.
  Our theoretical analysis establishes four key results: (1) positional encodings induce martingale violations of order $\Theta(\log n / n)$; (2) transformers achieve information-theoretic optimality with excess risk $O(n^{-1/2})$ in expectation over orderings; (3) the implicit posterior representation converges to the true Bayesian posterior in the space of sufficient statistics; and (4) we derive the optimal chain-of-thought length as $k^* = \Theta(\sqrt{n}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ with explicit constants, providing a principled approach to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance. Empirical validation on GPT-3 confirms predictions (1)-(3), with transformers reaching 99\% of theoretical entropy limits within 20 examples. Our framework provides practical methods for extracting calibrated uncertainty estimates from position-aware architectures and optimizing computational efficiency in deployment.

Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment policy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal policy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized treatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal value is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing inference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this non-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators based on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These approaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic parametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches that directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place parametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the computation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic $L^\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that prohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of constructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals. By carefully controlling first-order bias and second-order remainders, we show that a softmax smoothing-based estimator can be used to estimate parameters that are specified as a maximum of scores involving nuisance components. In particular, this includes the value of the optimal treatment policy as a special case. Our estimator obtains $\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates, avoids parametric restrictions/unrealistic margin assumptions, and is often statistically efficient.

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials, including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of uMLIPs.

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and category-sensitive patterns.

Abstract: Inference is now the dominant AI workload, yet existing systems force trade-offs between latency, throughput, and cost. Arctic Inference, an open-source vLLM plugin from Snowflake AI Research, introduces Shift Parallelism, a dynamic parallelism strategy that adapts to real-world traffic while integrating speculative decoding, SwiftKV compute reduction, and optimized embedding inference. It achieves up to 3.4 times faster request completion, 1.75 times faster generation, and 1.6M tokens/sec per GPU for embeddings, outperforming both latency- and throughput-optimized deployments. Already powering Snowflake Cortex AI, Arctic Inference delivers state-of-the-art, cost-effective inference for enterprise AI and is now available to the community.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have been demonstrated to be able to learn low dimensional representations of data that preserve information required for downstream tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that flow matching based generative models can learn compact, semantically rich latent representations of field level cold dark matter (CDM) simulation data without supervision. Our model, CosmoFlow, learns representations 32x smaller than the raw field data, usable for field level reconstruction, synthetic data generation, and parameter inference. Our model also learns interpretable representations, in which different latent channels correspond to features at different cosmological scales.

<title>Your LLM Knows the Future: Uncovering Its Multi-Token Prediction Potential</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any loss in quality.

<title>Choosing the Better Bandit Algorithm under Data Sharing: When Do A/B Experiments Work?</title>

Abstract: We study A/B experiments that are designed to compare the performance of two recommendation algorithms. Prior work has shown that the standard difference-in-means estimator is biased in estimating the global treatment effect (GTE) due to a particular form of interference between experimental units. Specifically, units under the treatment and control algorithms contribute to a shared pool of data that subsequently train both algorithms, resulting in interference between the two groups. The bias arising from this type of data sharing is known as "symbiosis bias". In this paper, we highlight that, for decision-making purposes, the sign of the GTE often matters more than its precise magnitude when selecting the better algorithm. We formalize this insight under a multi-armed bandit framework and theoretically characterize when the sign of the expected GTE estimate under data sharing aligns with or contradicts the sign of the true GTE. Our analysis identifies the level of exploration versus exploitation as a key determinant of how symbiosis bias impacts algorithm selection.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models has created a pressing need for tools that help scientists, engineers, and policymakers interpret and refine model decisions and predictions. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, have emerged as a popular approach for this purpose.
  However, the heuristic foundations of influence functions rely on low-dimensional assumptions where the number of parameters $p$ is much smaller than the number of observations $n$. In contrast, modern AI models often operate in high-dimensional regimes with large $p$, challenging these assumptions.
  In this paper, we examine the accuracy of influence functions in high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that influence functions cannot reliably fulfill their intended purpose. We then introduce an alternative approximation, called Newfluence, that maintains similar computational efficiency while offering significantly improved accuracy.
  Newfluence is expected to provide more accurate insights than many existing methods for interpreting complex AI models and diagnosing their issues. Moreover, the high-dimensional framework we develop in this paper can also be applied to analyze other popular techniques, such as Shapley values.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding, which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to 4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world applications.

<title>RNAMunin: A Deep Machine Learning Model for Non-coding RNA Discovery</title>

Abstract: Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology, stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail. Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin is very small and very fast.

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays, especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs, which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models excel in question-answering (QA) yet still struggle with multi-hop reasoning and temporal questions. Query-based knowledge graph QA (KGQA) offers a modular alternative by generating executable queries instead of direct answers. We explore multi-stage query-based framework for WikiData QA, proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method using CoT reasoning. Our results demonstrate the potential of query-based multi-stage KGQA framework for improving multi-hop and temporal QA with small language models.

<title>PoTPTQ: A Two-step Power-of-Two Post-training for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

Abstract: Approaches to enhancing data quality (DQ) are classified into two main categories: data- and process-driven. However, prior research has predominantly utilized batch data preprocessing within the data-driven framework, which often proves insufficient for optimizing machine learning (ML) model performance and frequently leads to distortions in data characteristics. Existing studies have primarily focused on data preprocessing rather than genuine data quality improvement (DQI). In this paper, we introduce d-DQIVAR, a novel visual analytics system designed to facilitate DQI strategies aimed at improving ML model performance. Our system integrates visual analytics techniques that leverage both data-driven and process-driven approaches. Data-driven techniques tackle DQ issues such as imputation, outlier detection, deletion, format standardization, removal of duplicate records, and feature selection. Process-driven strategies encompass evaluating DQ and DQI procedures by considering DQ dimensions and ML model performance and applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate how our system empowers users to harness expert and domain knowledge effectively within a practical workflow through case studies, evaluations, and user studies.

Abstract: Selecting the appropriate dimensionality reduction (DR) technique and determining its optimal hyperparameter settings that maximize the accuracy of the output projections typically involves extensive trial and error, often resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR optimization without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: This article presents the current state of ML-security and of the documentation of ML-based systems, models and datasets in research and practice based on an extensive review of the existing literature. It shows a generally low awareness of security aspects among ML-practitioners and organizations and an often unstandardized approach to documentation, leading to overall low quality of ML-documentation. Existing standards are not regularly adopted in practice and IT-security aspects are often not included in documentation. Due to these factors, there is a clear need for improved security documentation in ML, as one step towards addressing the existing gaps in ML-security. To achieve this, we propose expanding existing documentation standards for ML-documentation to include a security section with specific security relevant information. Implementing this, a novel expanded method of documenting security requirements in ML-documentation is presented, based on the existing Model Cards and Datasheets for Datasets standards, but with the recommendation to adopt these findings in all ML-documentation.

Abstract: Archetypal Analysis (AA) is an unsupervised learning method that represents data as convex combinations of extreme patterns called archetypes. While AA provides interpretable and low-dimensional representations, it can inadvertently encode sensitive attributes, leading to fairness concerns. In this work, we propose Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA), a modified formulation that explicitly reduces the influence of sensitive group information in the learned projections. We also introduce FairKernelAA, a nonlinear extension that addresses fairness in more complex data distributions. Our approach incorporates a fairness regularization term while preserving the structure and interpretability of the archetypes. We evaluate FairAA and FairKernelAA on synthetic datasets, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-group scenarios, demonstrating their ability to reduce group separability -- as measured by mean maximum discrepancy and linear separability -- without substantially compromising explained variance. We further validate our methods on the real-world ANSUR I dataset, confirming their robustness and practical utility. The results show that FairAA achieves a favorable trade-off between utility and fairness, making it a promising tool for responsible representation learning in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health, thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm, enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting. Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block, enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0 forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

We collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach found effective previously.

Abstract: In this paper, we present enhanced analysis for sign-based optimization algorithms with momentum updates. Traditional sign-based methods, under the separable smoothness assumption, guarantee a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$, but they either require large batch sizes or assume unimodal symmetric stochastic noise. To address these limitations, we demonstrate that signSGD with momentum can achieve the same convergence rate using constant batch sizes without additional assumptions. Our analysis, under the standard $l_2$-smoothness condition, improves upon the result of the prior momentum-based signSGD method by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2})$, where $d$ is the problem dimension. Furthermore, we explore sign-based methods with majority vote in distributed settings and show that the proposed momentum-based method yields convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} + dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \{ d^{1/4}T^{-1/4}, d^{1/10}T^{-1/5} \} \right)$, which outperform the previous results of $\mathcal{O}\left( dT^{-1/4} + dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( d^{3/8}T^{-1/8} \right)$, respectively. Numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Multi-party secure computing and anomaly detection mechanisms further enhance system resilience against malicious attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves dual optimization of recommendation accuracy and system efficiency while ensuring privacy, providing both a practical solution and a theoretical foundation for applying privacy protection technologies in advertisement recommendation.

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability. This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model (LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases, and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency. Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment, score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while also delivering promising transcription and mistake detection results.

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future research https://github.com/azhar-ikhtiarudin/bench-rlqas.

<title>Sparse Autoencoders for Sequential Recommendation Models: Interpretation and Flexible Control</title>

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior, providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

Abstract: \noindent Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with \emph{arbitrary} stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM. Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step, implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity, demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow recirculation.

<title>Site-Level Fine-Tuning with Progressive Layer Freezing: Towards Robust Prediction of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia from Day-1 Chest Radiographs in Extremely Preterm Infants</title>

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code at https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.

<title>Compositional Discrete Latent Code for High Fidelity, Productive Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.

<title>Neural Polar Decoders for Deletion Channels</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically, the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel. We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates $\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&amp;E-stained regions, it outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset will be available at GitHub.

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website: https://rchalyang.github.io/EgoVLA

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements. Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

<title>Characterizing State Space Model (SSM) and SSM-Transformer Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context Length</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12442</link>

Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the sub-cellular level.

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline (4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Abstract: A computational theory for clustering and a semi-supervised clustering algorithm is presented. Clustering is defined to be the obtainment of groupings of data such that each group contains no anomalies with respect to a chosen grouping principle and measure; all other examples are considered to be fringe points, isolated anomalies, anomalous clusters or unknown clusters. More precisely, after appropriate modelling under the assumption of uniform random distribution, any example whose expectation of occurrence is <1 with respect to a group is considered an anomaly; otherwise it is assigned a membership of that group. Thus, clustering is conceived as the dual of anomaly detection. The representation of data is taken to be the Euclidean distance of a point to a cluster median. This is due to the robustness properties of the median to outliers, its approximate location of centrality and so that decision boundaries are general purpose. The kernel of the clustering method is the perception anomaly detection algorithm, resulting in a parameter-free, fast, and efficient clustering algorithm. Acknowledging that clustering is an interactive and iterative process, the algorithm relies on a small fraction of known relationships between examples. These relationships serve as seeds to define the user's objectives and guide the clustering process. The method then expands the clusters accordingly, leaving the remaining examples for exploration and subsequent iterations. Results are presented on synthetic and realworld data sets, demonstrating the advantages over the most popular unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering methods.

Abstract: This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.

Abstract: This research project investigated the correlation between a 10 Hz time series of thermocouple temperatures and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) computed from wind speeds collected from a small experimental prescribed burn at the Silas Little Experimental Forest in New Jersey, USA. The primary objective of this project was to explore the potential for using thermocouple temperatures as predictors for estimating the TKE produced by a wildland fire. Machine learning models, including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and Gaussian Process Regressor, are employed to assess the potential for thermocouple temperature perturbations to predict TKE values. Data visualization and correlation analyses reveal patterns and relationships between thermocouple temperatures and TKE, providing insight into the underlying dynamics. The project achieves high accuracy in predicting TKE by employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between the predictors and the target variable. The results demonstrate significant success, particularly from regression models, in accurately estimating the TKE. The research findings contribute to fire behavior and smoke modeling science, emphasizing the importance of incorporating machine learning approaches and identifying complex relationships between fine-scale fire behavior and turbulence. Accurate TKE estimation using thermocouple temperatures allows for the refinement of models that can inform decision-making in fire management strategies, facilitate effective risk mitigation, and optimize fire management efforts. This project highlights the valuable role of machine learning techniques in analyzing wildland fire data, showcasing their potential to advance fire research and management practices.

Abstract: Data sharing is a necessity for innovative progress in many domains, especially in healthcare. However, the ability to share data is hindered by regulations protecting the privacy of natural persons. Synthetic tabular data provide a promising solution to address data sharing difficulties but does not inherently guarantee privacy. Still, there is a lack of agreement on appropriate methods for assessing the privacy-preserving capabilities of synthetic data, making it difficult to compare results across studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to identify properties that constitute good universal privacy evaluation metrics for synthetic tabular data. The goal of universally applicable metrics is to enable comparability across studies and to allow non-technical stakeholders to understand how privacy is protected. We identify four principles for the assessment of metrics: Comparability, Applicability, Interpretability, and Representativeness (CAIR). To quantify and rank the degree to which evaluation metrics conform to the CAIR principles, we design a rubric using a scale of 1-4. Each of the four properties is scored on four parameters, yielding 16 total dimensions. We study the applicability and usefulness of the CAIR principles and rubric by assessing a selection of metrics popular in other studies. The results provide granular insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing metrics that not only rank the metrics but highlight areas of potential improvements. We expect that the CAIR principles will foster agreement among researchers and organizations on which universal privacy evaluation metrics are appropriate for synthetic tabular data.

Abstract: In light of emerging legal requirements and policies focused on privacy protection, there is a growing trend of companies across various industries adopting Federated Learning (FL). This decentralized approach involves multiple clients or silos, collaboratively training a global model under the coordination of a central server while utilizing their private local data. Unlike traditional methods that necessitate data sharing and transmission, Cross-Silo FL allows clients to share model updates rather than raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. Despite its growing adoption, the carbon impact associated with Cross-Silo FL remains poorly understood due to the limited research in this area. This study seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating the sustainability of Cross-Silo FL throughout the entire AI product lifecycle, extending the analysis beyond the model training phase alone. We systematically compare this decentralized method with traditional centralized approaches and present a robust quantitative framework for assessing the costs and CO2 emissions in real-world Cross-Silo FL environments. Our findings indicate that the energy consumption and costs of model training are comparable between Cross-Silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning. However, the additional data transfer and storage requirements inherent in Centralized Learning can result in significant, often overlooked CO2 emissions. Moreover, we introduce an innovative data and application management system that integrates Cross-Silo FL and analytics, aiming at improving the sustainability and economic efficiency of IT enterprises.

Abstract: As vast databases of chemical identities become increasingly available, the challenge shifts to how we effectively explore and leverage these resources to study molecular properties. This paper presents an active learning approach for molecular discovery using Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), demonstrated on the QM9 dataset. DKL links structural embeddings directly to properties, creating organized latent spaces that prioritize relevant property information. By iteratively recalculating embedding vectors in alignment with target properties, DKL uncovers concentrated maxima representing key molecular properties and reveals unexplored regions with potential for innovation. This approach underscores DKL's potential in advancing molecular research and discovery.

Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD, Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that the flow converges exponentially fast to the free energy's minimizers for models satisfying a condition that generalizes both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively). We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying the extension to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I extension holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error and obtain the non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We propose a new neural network based method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) by formulating the PDE inverse problem as a bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. We provide a theoretical analysis that justifies our approach. Through extensive experiments over multiple PDE systems, we demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to the soft PDE constraints in many existing methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art link prediction (LP) models demonstrate impressive benchmark results. However, popular benchmark datasets often assume that training, validation, and testing samples are representative of the overall dataset distribution. In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; uncontrolled factors lead new dataset samples to come from a different distribution than training samples. Additionally, the majority of recent work with graph dataset shift focuses on node- and graph-level tasks, largely ignoring link-level tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel splitting strategy, known as LPShift, which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify LPShift's effect through empirical evaluation of SOTA LP models on 16 LPShift variants of original dataset splits, with results indicating drastic changes to model performance. Additional experiments demonstrate graph structure has a strong influence on the success of current generalization methods. Source Code Available Here: https://github.com/revolins/LPShift

Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features, in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multi-component approach, in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multi-layer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multi-component structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

Abstract: Generating novel molecules is challenging, with most representations leading to generative models producing many invalid molecules. Spanning Tree-based Graph Generation (STGG) is a promising approach to ensure the generation of valid molecules, outperforming state-of-the-art SMILES and graph diffusion models for unconditional generation. In the real world, we want to be able to generate molecules conditional on one or multiple desired properties rather than unconditionally. Thus, in this work, we extend STGG to multi-property-conditional generation. Our approach, STGG+, incorporates a modern Transformer architecture, random masking of properties during training (enabling conditioning on any subset of properties and classifier-free guidance), an auxiliary property-prediction loss (allowing the model to self-criticize molecules and select the best ones), and other improvements. We show that STGG+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditional generation, and reward maximization.

Abstract: Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) is a theoretically established algorithm for Bayesian optimization (BO), where we assume the objective function $f$ follows a GP. One notable drawback of GP-UCB is that the theoretical confidence parameter $\beta$ increases along with the iterations and is too large. To alleviate this drawback, this paper analyzes the randomized variant of GP-UCB called improved randomized GP-UCB (IRGP-UCB), which uses the confidence parameter generated from the shifted exponential distribution. We analyze the expected regret and conditional expected regret, where the expectation and the probability are taken respectively with $f$ and noise and with the randomness of the BO algorithm. In both regret analyses, IRGP-UCB achieves a sub-linear regret upper bound without increasing the confidence parameter if the input domain is finite. Furthermore, we show that randomization plays a key role in avoiding an increase in confidence parameter by showing that GP-UCB using a constant confidence parameter can incur linearly growing expected cumulative regret. Finally, we show numerical experiments using synthetic and benchmark functions and real-world emulators.

Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM), or infilling, has become integral to code language models, enabling generation of missing code given both left and right contexts. However, the current FIM training paradigm which performs next-token prediction (NTP) over reordered sequence often leads to models struggling to generate content that aligns well with the surrounding context. We hypothesize that NTP alone is insufficient for models to learn effective planning conditioned on the distant right context, a critical factor for successful code infilling. To overcome this, we propose Horizon-Length Prediction (HLP), a novel training objective that teaches models to predict the number of remaining middle tokens at each step. HLP advances FIM with lookahead planning, enabling models to inherently learn infilling boundaries for arbitrary left and right contexts without relying on dataset-specific post-processing. Our evaluation across different model families and sizes shows that HLP significantly improves FIM performance by up to 24% relatively on diverse benchmarks, across file-level and repository-level. Furthermore, the enhanced planning capability gained through HLP boosts model performance on code reasoning. Importantly, HLP incurs negligible training overhead and no additional inference cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting the biophysical and functional properties of proteins is essential for in silico protein design. Machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for such prediction tasks. However, the relative scarcity of in vitro annotations means that these models often have little, or no, specific data on the desired fitness prediction task. As a result of limited data, protein language models (PLMs) are typically trained on general protein sequence modeling tasks, and then fine-tuned, or applied zero-shot, to protein fitness prediction. When no task data is available, the models make strong assumptions about the correlation between the protein sequence likelihood and fitness scores. In contrast, we propose meta-learning over a distribution of standard fitness prediction tasks, and demonstrate positive transfer to unseen fitness prediction tasks. Our method, called Metalic (Meta-Learning In-Context), uses in-context learning and fine-tuning, when data is available, to adapt to new tasks. Crucially, fine-tuning enables considerable generalization, even though it is not accounted for during meta-training. Our fine-tuned models achieve strong results with 18 times fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our method sets a new state-of-the-art in low-data settings on ProteinGym, an established fitness-prediction benchmark. Due to data scarcity, we believe meta-learning will play a pivotal role in advancing protein engineering.

Abstract: Trustworthiness in neural networks is crucial for their deployment in critical applications, where reliability, confidence, and uncertainty play pivotal roles in decision-making. Traditional performance metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases where models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural networks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust, disbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing opinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where post-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed framework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with potential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.

Abstract: Continual learning methods based on pre-trained models (PTM) have recently gained attention which adapt to successive downstream tasks without catastrophic forgetting. These methods typically refrain from updating the pre-trained parameters and instead employ additional adapters, prompts, and classifiers. In this paper, we from a novel perspective investigate the benefit of sparse orthogonal parameters for continual learning. We found that merging sparse orthogonality of models learned from multiple streaming tasks has great potential in addressing catastrophic forgetting. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel yet effective method called SoTU (Sparse Orthogonal Parameters TUning). We hypothesize that the effectiveness of SoTU lies in the transformation of knowledge learned from multiple domains into the fusion of orthogonal delta parameters. Experimental evaluations on diverse CL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Notably, SoTU achieves optimal feature representation for streaming data without necessitating complex classifier designs, making it a Plug-and-Play solution.

Abstract: The detection and clearance of explosive ordnance (EO) continues to be a predominantly manual and high-risk process that can benefit from advances in technology to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. Research on artificial intelligence (AI) for EO detection in clearance operations has grown significantly in recent years. However, this research spans a wide range of fields, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of current trends and developments. Therefore, this article provides a literature review of academic research on AI for EO detection in clearance operations. It finds that research can be grouped into two main streams: AI for EO object detection and AI for EO risk prediction, with the latter being much less studied than the former. From the literature review, we develop three opportunities for future research. These include a call for renewed efforts in the use of AI for EO risk prediction, the combination of different AI systems and data sources, and novel approaches to improve EO risk prediction performance, such as pattern-based predictions. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of AI for EO detection in clearance operations. We emphasize the role of traditional machine learning (ML) for this task, the need to dynamically incorporate expert knowledge into the models, and the importance of effectively integrating AI systems with real-world operations.

<title>Complexity-Aware Training of Deep Neural Networks for Optimal Structure Discovery</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for combined unit and layer pruning of deep neural networks that functions during training and without requiring a pre-trained network to apply. Our algorithm optimally trades-off learning accuracy and pruning levels while balancing layer vs. unit pruning and computational vs. parameter complexity using only three user-defined parameters, which are easy to interpret and tune. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem over the network weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for binary Random Variables taking values either 0 or 1 and scaling the units and layers of the network. Optimal network structures are found as the solution to this optimization problem. Pruning occurs when a variational parameter converges to 0 rendering the corresponding structure permanently inactive, thus saving computations both during training and prediction. A key contribution of our approach is to define a cost function that combines the objectives of prediction accuracy and network pruning in a computational/parameter complexity-aware manner and the automatic selection of the many regularization parameters. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to solutions of the optimization problem corresponding to deterministic networks. We analyze the ODE system that underlies our stochastic optimization algorithm and establish domains of attraction for the dynamics of the network parameters. These theoretical results lead to practical pruning conditions avoiding the premature pruning of units and layers during training. We evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets using ResNet architectures and demonstrate that it gives improved results with respect to pruning ratios and test accuracy over layer-only or unit-only pruning and favorably competes with combined unit and layer pruning algorithms requiring pre-trained networks.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks--and more recently, large models demands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin. The implementation of MARS is available at https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS.

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.

Abstract: We present Poisson Binomial Mechanism Vertical Federated Learning (PBM-VFL), a communication-efficient Vertical Federated Learning algorithm with Differential Privacy guarantees. PBM-VFL combines Secure Multi-Party Computation with the recently introduced Poisson Binomial Mechanism to protect parties' private datasets during model training. We define the novel concept of feature privacy and analyze end-to-end feature and sample privacy of our algorithm. We compare sample privacy loss in VFL with privacy loss in HFL. We also provide the first theoretical characterization of the relationship between privacy budget, convergence error, and communication cost in differentially-private VFL. Finally, we empirically show that our model performs well with high levels of privacy.

Abstract: Hyperbolic space naturally encodes hierarchical structures such as phylogenies (binary trees), where inward-bending geodesics reflect paths through least common ancestors, and the exponential growth of neighborhoods mirrors the super-exponential scaling of topologies. This scaling challenge limits the efficiency of Euclidean-based approximate inference methods. Motivated by the geometric connections between trees and hyperbolic space, we develop novel hyperbolic extensions of two sequential search algorithms: Combinatorial and Nested Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo (\textsc{Csmc} and \textsc{Ncsmc}). Our approach introduces consistent and unbiased estimators, along with variational inference methods (\textsc{H-Vcsmc} and \textsc{H-Vncsmc}), which outperform their Euclidean counterparts. Empirical results demonstrate improved speed, scalability and performance in high-dimensional phylogenetic inference tasks.

Abstract: We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent (SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.

Abstract: In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), deployed policies have varied impacts on different stakeholders, creating challenges in reaching consensus on how to effectively aggregate their preferences. Generalized $p$-means form a widely used class of social welfare functions for this purpose, with broad applications in fair resource allocation, AI alignment, and decision-making. This class includes well-known welfare functions such as Egalitarian, Nash, and Utilitarian welfare. However, selecting the appropriate social welfare function is challenging for decision-makers, as the structure and outcomes of optimal policies can be highly sensitive to the choice of $p$. To address this challenge, we study the concept of an $\alpha$-approximate portfolio in RL, a set of policies that are approximately optimal across the family of generalized $p$-means for all $p \in [-\infty, 1]$. We propose algorithms to compute such portfolios and provide theoretical guarantees on the trade-offs among approximation factor, portfolio size, and computational efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in summarizing the policy space induced by varying $p$ values, empowering decision-makers to navigate this landscape more effectively.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

Abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning is a powerful paradigm in machine learning for modeling and exploiting the underlying graph structure that captures the relationship between labeled and unlabeled data. A large number of classical as well as modern deep learning based algorithms have been proposed for this problem, often having tunable hyperparameters. We initiate a formal study of tuning algorithm hyperparameters from parameterized algorithm families for this problem. We obtain novel $O(\log n)$ pseudo-dimension upper bounds for hyperparameter selection in three classical label propagation-based algorithm families, where $n$ is the number of nodes, implying bounds on the amount of data needed for learning provably good parameters. We further provide matching $\Omega(\log n)$ pseudo-dimension lower bounds, thus asymptotically characterizing the learning-theoretic complexity of the parameter tuning problem. We extend our study to selecting architectural hyperparameters in modern graph neural networks. We bound the Rademacher complexity for tuning the self-loop weighting in recently proposed Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) networks. We further propose a tunable architecture that interpolates graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) in every layer, and provide Rademacher complexity bounds for tuning the interpolation coefficient.

Abstract: We establish the asymptotic implicit bias of gradient descent (GD) for generic non-homogeneous deep networks under exponential loss. Specifically, we characterize three key properties of GD iterates starting from a sufficiently small empirical risk, where the threshold is determined by a measure of the network's non-homogeneity. First, we show that a normalized margin induced by the GD iterates increases nearly monotonically. Second, we prove that while the norm of the GD iterates diverges to infinity, the iterates themselves converge in direction. Finally, we establish that this directional limit satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem. Prior works on implicit bias have focused exclusively on homogeneous networks; in contrast, our results apply to a broad class of non-homogeneous networks satisfying a mild near-homogeneity condition. In particular, our results apply to networks with residual connections and non-homogeneous activation functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed by Ji and Telgarsky (2020).

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have highlighted the potential of automating interpretability pipelines in analyzing the latent representations within LLMs. While this may enhance our understanding of internal mechanisms, the field lacks standardized evaluation methods for assessing the validity of discovered features. We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for automatically evaluating feature-to-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes of the misalignment between features and their descriptions. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability. We release FADE as an open-source package at: https://github.com/brunibrun/FADE

Abstract: Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning (ML) model training among decentralized clients' information, ensuring data privacy. The decentralized nature of FL deals with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This open problem has notable consequences, such as decreased model performance and more significant convergence times. Despite its importance, experimental studies systematically addressing all types of data heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IIDness) remain scarce. We aim to fill this gap by assessing and quantifying the non-IID effect through a thorough empirical analysis. We use the Hellinger Distance (HD) to measure differences in distribution among clients. Our study benchmarks four state-of-the-art strategies for handling non-IID data, including label, feature, quantity, and spatiotemporal skewness, under realistic and controlled conditions. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal skew effect in FL. Our findings highlight the significant impact of label and spatiotemporal skew non-IID types on FL model performance, with notable performance drops occurring at specific HD thresholds. Additionally, the FL performance is heavily affected mainly when the non-IIDness is extreme. Thus, we provide recommendations for FL research to tackle data heterogeneity effectively. Our work represents the most extensive examination of non-IIDness in FL, offering a robust foundation for future research.

Abstract: This application paper investigates the stability of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), as characterized by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM). First, we contribute a database of 4544 electron densities associated to four isomers of water hexamers (the so-called Ring, Book, Cage and Prism), generated by distorting their equilibrium geometry under various structural perturbations, modeling the natural dynamic behavior of molecular systems. Second, we present a new stability measure, called bond occurrence rate, associating each bond path present at equilibrium with its rate of occurrence within the input ensemble. We also provide an algorithm, called BondMatcher, for its automatic computation, based on a tailored, geometry-aware partial isomorphism estimation between the extremum graphs of the considered electron densities. Our new stability measure allows for the automatic identification of densities lacking H-bond paths, enabling further visual inspections. Specifically, the topological analysis enabled by our framework corroborates experimental observations and provides refined geometrical criteria for characterizing the disappearance of H-bond paths. Our electron density database and our C++ implementation are available at this address: https://github.com/thom-dani/BondMatcher.

Abstract: Accurate and concise governing equations are crucial for understanding system dynamics. Recently, data-driven methods such as sparse regression have been employed to automatically uncover governing equations from data, representing a significant shift from traditional first-principles modeling. However, most existing methods focus on scalar equations, limiting their applicability to simple, low-dimensional scenarios, and failing to ensure rotation and reflection invariance without incurring significant computational cost or requiring additional prior knowledge. This paper proposes a Cartesian tensor-based sparse regression (CTSR) technique to accurately and efficiently uncover complex, high-dimensional governing equations while ensuring invariance. Evaluations on two two-dimensional (2D) and two three-dimensional (3D) test cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the conventional technique.

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha < s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework that connects predictive coding (PC), a biologically inspired local learning rule, with the minimum description length (MDL) principle in deep networks. We prove that layerwise PC performs block-coordinate descent on the MDL two-part code objective, thereby jointly minimizing empirical risk and model complexity. Using Hoeffding's inequality and a prefix-code prior, we derive a novel generalization bound of the form $R(\theta) \le \hat{R}(\theta) + \frac{L(\theta)}{N}$, capturing the tradeoff between fit and compression. We further prove that each PC sweep monotonically decreases the empirical two-part codelength, yielding tighter high-probability risk bounds than unconstrained gradient descent. Finally, we show that repeated PC updates converge to a block-coordinate stationary point, providing an approximate MDL-optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first result offering formal generalization and convergence guarantees for PC-trained deep models, positioning PC as a theoretically grounded and biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy. However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning, which includes an optimal proximal term and utilizes a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model performance and clients' low computing cost.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed.

<title>Simplifying Graph Kernels for Efficient</title>

Abstract: While kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks offer complementary strengths, integrating the two has posed challenges in efficiency and scalability. The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel provides a theoretical bridge by interpreting GNNs through the lens of neural tangent kernels. However, its reliance on deep, stacked layers introduces repeated computations that hinder performance. In this work, we introduce a new perspective by designing the simplified graph kernel, which replaces deep layer stacking with a streamlined $K$-step message aggregation process. This formulation avoids iterative layer-wise propagation altogether, leading to a more concise and computationally efficient framework without sacrificing the expressive power needed for graph tasks. Beyond this simplification, we propose another Simplified Graph Kernel, which draws from Gaussian Process theory to model infinite-width GNNs. Rather than simulating network depth, this kernel analytically computes kernel values based on the statistical behavior of nonlinear activations in the infinite limit. This eliminates the need for explicit architecture simulation, further reducing complexity. Our experiments on standard graph and node classification benchmarks show that our methods achieve competitive accuracy while reducing runtime. This makes them practical alternatives for learning on graphs at scale. Full implementation and reproducibility materials are provided at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SGNK-1CE4/.

<title>MatRL: Provably Generalizable Iterative Algorithm Discovery via Monte-Carlo Tree Search</title>

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that outperform various baselines in the literature.

arXiv:1909.10455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study computational and statistical consequences of problem geometry in stochastic and online optimization. By focusing on constraint set and gradient geometry, we characterize the problem families for which stochastic- and adaptive-gradient methods are (minimax) optimal and, conversely, when nonlinear updates -- such as those mirror descent employs -- are necessary for optimal convergence. When the constraint set is quadratically convex, diagonally pre-conditioned stochastic gradient methods are minimax optimal. We provide quantitative converses showing that the ``distance'' of the underlying constraints from quadratic convexity determines the sub-optimality of subgradient methods. These results apply, for example, to any $\ell_p$-ball for $p < 2$, and the computation/accuracy tradeoffs they demonstrate exhibit a striking analogy to those in Gaussian sequence models.

Abstract: We introduce EPIC-SOUNDS, a large-scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos. We propose an annotation pipeline where annotators temporally label distinguishable audio segments and describe the action that could have caused this sound. We identify actions that can be discriminated purely from audio, through grouping these free-form descriptions of audio into classes. For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human annotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed on a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities. Overall, EPIC-SOUNDS includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised segments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and detection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods. We also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the temporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the ambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of audio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions that sound.

<title>Prominent Roles of Conditionally Invariant Components in Domain Adaptation: Theory and Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) is a statistical learning problem that arises when the distribution of the source data used to train a model differs from that of the target data used to evaluate the model. While many DA algorithms have demonstrated considerable empirical success, blindly applying these algorithms can often lead to worse performance on new datasets. To address this, it is crucial to clarify the assumptions under which a DA algorithm has good target performance. In this work, we focus on the assumption of the presence of conditionally invariant components (CICs), which are relevant for prediction and remain conditionally invariant across the source and target data. We demonstrate that CICs, which can be estimated through conditional invariant penalty (CIP), play three prominent roles in providing target risk guarantees in DA. First, we propose a new algorithm based on CICs, importance-weighted conditional invariant penalty (IW-CIP), which has target risk guarantees beyond simple settings such as covariate shift and label shift. Second, we show that CICs help identify large discrepancies between source and target risks of other DA algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating CICs into the domain invariant projection (DIP) algorithm can address its failure scenario caused by label-flipping features. We support our new algorithms and theoretical findings via numerical experiments on synthetic data, MNIST, CelebA, Camelyon17, and DomainNet datasets.

arXiv:2312.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces RACER, the Rational Artificial Intelligence Car-following model Enhanced by Reality, a cutting-edge deep learning car-following model, that satisfies partial derivative constraints, designed to predict Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) driving behavior while staying theoretically feasible. Unlike conventional models, RACER effectively integrates Rational Driving Constraints (RDCs), crucial tenets of actual driving, resulting in strikingly accurate and realistic predictions. Against established models like the Optimal Velocity Relative Velocity (OVRV), a car-following Neural Network (NN), and a car-following Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), RACER excels across key metrics, such as acceleration, velocity, and spacing. Notably, it displays a perfect adherence to the RDCs, registering zero violations, in stark contrast to other models. This study highlights the immense value of incorporating physical constraints within AI models, especially for augmenting safety measures in transportation. It also paves the way for future research to test these models against human driving data, with the potential to guide safer and more rational driving behavior. The versatility of the proposed model, including its potential to incorporate additional derivative constraints and broader architectural applications, enhances its appeal and broadens its impact within the scientific community.

<title>On the Statistical Properties of Generative Adversarial Models for Low Intrinsic Data Dimension</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15801</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2401.15801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the theoretical guarantees for their statistical accuracy remain rather pessimistic. In particular, the data distributions on which GANs are applied, such as natural images, are often hypothesized to have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure in a typically high-dimensional feature space, but this is often not reflected in the derived rates in the state-of-the-art analyses. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of GANs and their bidirectional variant, Bi-directional GANs (BiGANs), by deriving statistical guarantees on the estimated densities in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the data and the latent space. We analytically show that if one has access to $n$ samples from the unknown target distribution and the network architectures are properly chosen, the expected Wasserstein-1 distance of the estimates from the target scales as $O\left( n^{-1/d_\mu } \right)$ for GANs and $\tilde{O}\left( n^{-1/(d_\mu+\ell)} \right)$ for BiGANs, where $d_\mu$ and $\ell$ are the upper Wasserstein-1 dimension of the data-distribution and latent-space dimension, respectively. The theoretical analyses not only suggest that these methods successfully avoid the curse of dimensionality, in the sense that the exponent of $n$ in the error rates does not depend on the data dimension but also serve to bridge the gap between the theoretical analyses of GANs and the known sharp rates from optimal transport literature. Additionally, we demonstrate that GANs can effectively achieve the minimax optimal rate even for non-smooth underlying distributions, with the use of interpolating generator networks.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models(LLMs) like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. Although numerous frameworks for governance of AI exist, it is not clear to what extent they apply to GenAI. Our review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works with the purpose of better understanding fundamental characteristics of GenAI and adjusting prior frameworks specifically towards GenAI governance within companies. To do so, it extends Nickerson's framework development processes to include prior conceptualizations. Our framework outlines the scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms tailored to harness business opportunities as well as mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. Our research contributes a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical insights for companies navigating the challenges of GenAI adoption and highlighting research gaps.

<title>Protecting Copyrighted Material with Unique Identifiers in Large Language Model Training</title>

Abstract: A primary concern regarding training large language models (LLMs) is whether they abuse copyrighted online text. With the increasing training data scale and the prevalence of LLMs in daily lives, two problems arise: \textbf{1)} false positive membership inference results misled by similar examples; \textbf{2)} membership inference methods are usually too complex for end users to understand and use. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detect} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{\textbf{ghost sentences}} and a user-friendly last-$k$ words test, allowing end users to chat with LLMs for membership inference. Ghost sentences consist primarily of unique passphrases of random natural words, which can come with customized elements to bypass possible filter rules. The last-$k$ words test requires a significant repetition time of ghost sentences~($\ge10$). For cases with fewer repetitions, we designed an extra perplexity test, as LLMs exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. We also conduct a comprehensive study on the memorization and membership inference of ghost sentences, examining factors such as training data scales, model sizes, repetition times, insertion positions, wordlist of passphrases, alignment, \textit{etc}. Our study shows the possibility of applying ghost sentences in real scenarios and provides instructions for the potential application.

Abstract: The rise of Transformer architectures has advanced medical image segmentation, leading to hybrid models that combine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. However, these models often suffer from excessive complexity and fail to effectively integrate spatial and channel features, crucial for precise segmentation. To address this, we propose LHU-Net, a Lean Hybrid U-Net for volumetric medical image segmentation. LHU-Net prioritizes spatial feature extraction before refining channel features, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets (Synapse, Left Atrial, BraTS-Decathlon, and Lung-Decathlon), LHU-Net consistently outperforms existing models across diverse modalities (CT/MRI) and output configurations. It achieves state-of-the-art Dice scores while using four times fewer parameters and 20% fewer FLOPs than competing models, without the need for pre-training, additional data, or model ensembles. With an average of 11 million parameters, LHU-Net sets a new benchmark for computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy. Our implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/xmindflow/LHUNet

arXiv:2410.09474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to transfer knowledge from large, accurate models (teachers) to smaller, efficient ones (students). Recent methods have explored enforcing consistency by incorporating causal interpretations to distill invariant representations. In this work, we extend this line of research by introducing a dual augmentation strategy to promote invariant feature learning in both teacher and student models. Our approach leverages different augmentations applied to both models during distillation, pushing the student to capture robust, transferable features. This dual augmentation strategy complements invariant causal distillation by ensuring that the learned representations remain stable across a wider range of data variations and transformations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving competitive results in same-architecture KD.

Abstract: Quality molecular representations are key to foundation model development in bio-medical research. Previous efforts have typically focused on a single representation or molecular view, which may have strengths or weaknesses on a given task. We develop Multi-view Molecular Embedding with Late Fusion (MMELON), an approach that integrates graph, image and text views in a foundation model setting and may be readily extended to additional representations. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules. The multi-view model performs robustly, matching the performance of the highest-ranked single-view. It is validated on over 120 tasks, including molecular solubility, ADME properties, and activity against G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). We identify 33 GPCRs that are related to Alzheimer's disease and employ the multi-view model to select strong binders from a compound screen. Predictions are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.

<title>TextDestroyer: A Training- and Annotation-Free Diffusion Method for Destroying Anomal Text from Images</title>

arXiv:2411.00355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose TextDestroyer, the first training- and annotation-free method for scene text destruction using a pre-trained diffusion model. Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.

Abstract: In distributed optimization, the communication of model updates can be a performance bottleneck. Consequently, gradient compression has been proposed as a means of increasing optimization throughput. In general, due to information loss, compression introduces a penalty on the number of iterations needed to reach a solution. In this work, we investigate how the iteration penalty depends on the interaction between compression and problem structure, in the context of non-convex stochastic optimization. We focus on linear schemes, where compression and decompression can be modeled as multiplication with a random matrix. We consider several distributions of matrices, among them Haar-distributed orthogonal matrices and matrices with random Gaussian entries. We find that the impact of compression on convergence can be quantified in terms of a smoothness matrix associated with the objective function, using a norm defined by the compression scheme. The analysis reveals that in certain cases, compression performance is related to low-rank structure or other spectral properties of the problem and our bounds predict that the penalty introduced by compression is significantly reduced compared to worst-case bounds that only consider the compression level, ignoring problem data. We verify the theoretical findings experimentally, including fine-tuning an image classification model.

Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Code and DesignBench can be found at https://github.com/google-deepmind/proactive_t2i_agents.

Abstract: We present Patherea, a unified framework for point-based cell detection and classification that enables the development and fair evaluation of state-of-the-art methods. To support this, we introduce a large-scale dataset that replicates the clinical workflow for Ki-67 proliferation index estimation. Our method directly predicts cell locations and classes without relying on intermediate representations. It incorporates a hybrid Hungarian matching strategy for accurate point assignment and supports flexible backbones and training regimes, including recent pathology foundation models. Patherea achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets - Lizard, BRCA-M2C, and BCData - while highlighting performance saturation on these benchmarks. In contrast, our newly proposed Patherea dataset presents a significantly more challenging benchmark. Additionally, we identify and correct common errors in current evaluation protocols and provide an updated benchmarking utility for standardized assessment. The Patherea dataset and code are publicly available to facilitate further research and fair comparisons.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised many fields, with LLM-as-a-service (LLMSaaS) offering accessible, general-purpose solutions without costly task-specific training. In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for directly solving tasks (in vivo), this paper explores LLMs' potential for in-vitro applications: using LLM-generated labels to improve supervised training of mainstream models. We examine two strategies - (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation - in empathy computing, an emerging task to predict psychology-based questionnaire outcomes from inputs like textual narratives. Crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. We show that replacing or supplementing these crowdsourced labels with LLM-generated labels, developed using psychology-based scale-aware prompts, achieves statistically significant accuracy improvements. Notably, the RoBERTa pre-trained language model (PLM) trained with noise-reduced labels yields a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on the public NewsEmp benchmarks. This paper further analyses evaluation metric selection and demographic biases to help guide the future development of more equitable empathy computing models. Code and LLM-generated labels are available at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/LLMPathy.

Abstract: In this work we propose MirrorCBO, a consensus-based optimization (CBO) method which generalizes standard CBO in the same way that mirror descent generalizes gradient descent. For this we apply the CBO methodology to a swarm of dual particles and retain the primal particle positions by applying the inverse of the mirror map, which we parametrize as the subdifferential of a strongly convex function $\phi$. In this way, we combine the advantages of a derivative-free non-convex optimization algorithm with those of mirror descent. As a special case, the method extends CBO to optimization problems with convex constraints. Assuming bounds on the Bregman distance associated to $\phi$, we provide asymptotic convergence results for MirrorCBO with explicit exponential rate. Another key contribution is an exploratory numerical study of this new algorithm across different application settings, focusing on (i) sparsity-inducing optimization, and (ii) constrained optimization, demonstrating the competitive performance of MirrorCBO. We observe empirically that the method can also be used for optimization on (non-convex) submanifolds of Euclidean space, can be adapted to mirrored versions of other recent CBO variants, and that it inherits from mirror descent the capability to select desirable minimizers, like sparse ones. We also include an overview of recent CBO approaches for constrained optimization and compare their performance to MirrorCBO.

<title>PATCH: a deep learning method to assess heterogeneity of artistic practice in historical paintings</title>

Abstract: The history of art has seen significant shifts in the manner in which artworks are created, making understanding of creative processes a central question in technical art history. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, paintings were largely produced by master painters directing workshops of apprentices who often contributed to projects. The masters varied significantly in artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists and implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even individual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and the processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning methods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative processes by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale. Analysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that documentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external examples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions. Here we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment training for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying individual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or "ground truth." The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and outperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the Spanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the Cross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially challenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members. Further, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of artistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and space.

Abstract: Ensuring model calibration is critical for reliable prediction, yet popular distribution-free methods such as histogram binning and isotonic regression offer only asymptotic guarantees. We introduce a unified framework for Venn and Venn-Abers calibration that extends Vovk's approach beyond binary classification to a broad class of prediction problems defined by generic loss functions. Our method transforms any perfectly in-sample calibrated predictor into a set-valued predictor that, in finite samples, outputs at least one marginally calibrated point prediction. These set predictions shrink asymptotically and converge to a single conditionally calibrated prediction, capturing epistemic uncertainty. We further propose Venn multicalibration, a new approach for achieving finite-sample calibration across subpopulations. For quantile loss, our framework recovers group-conditional and multicalibrated conformal prediction as special cases and yields novel prediction intervals with quantile-conditional coverage.

Abstract: Significant efforts have been directed towards adapting self-supervised multimodal learning for Earth observation applications. However, most current methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks: canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping. The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low-data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong performances near or better than the state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.

Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.

<title>How does Watermarking Affect Visual Language Models in Document Understanding?</title>

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have become foundational models for document understanding tasks, widely used in the processing of complex multimodal documents across domains such as finance, law, and academia. However, documents often contain noise-like information, such as watermarks, which inevitably leads us to inquire: \emph{Do watermarks degrade the performance of VLMs in document understanding?} To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to investigate the effect of visible watermarks on VLMs performance. We takes into account various factors, including different types of document data, the positions of watermarks within documents and variations in watermark content. Our experimental results reveal that VLMs performance can be significantly compromised by watermarks, with performance drop rates reaching up to 36\%. We discover that \emph{scattered} watermarks cause stronger interference than centralized ones, and that \emph{semantic contents} in watermarks creates greater disruption than simple visual occlusion. Through attention mechanism analysis and embedding similarity examination, we find that the performance drops are mainly attributed to that watermarks 1) force widespread attention redistribution, and 2) alter semantic representation in the embedding space. Our research not only highlights significant challenges in deploying VLMs for document understanding, but also provides insights towards developing robust inference mechanisms on watermarked documents.

Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.

Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.

<title>Lost in Transmission: When and Why LLMs Fail to Reason Globally</title>

Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

<title>AKReF: An argumentative knowledge representation framework for structured argumentation</title>

arXiv:2506.00713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). The proposed argumentative knowledge representation framework (AKReF) extends the theoretical foundation and enables the AKG to provide a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand. Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we apply modus ponens on premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes capturing key argumentative features such as the type of premise (e.g., axiom, ordinary premise, assumption), the type of inference rule (e.g., strict, defeasible), preference order over defeasible rules, markers (e.g., "therefore", "however"), and the type of attack (e.g., undercut, rebuttal, undermining). We identify inference rules by locating a specific set of markers, called inference markers (IM). This, in turn, makes it possible to identify undercut attacks previously undetectable in existing datasets. AKG prepares the ground for reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is essential to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, helps reasoning models learn the implicit, indirect relations that require inference over arguments and their interconnections. We use an essay from the AAEC dataset to illustrate the framework. We further show its application in complex analyses such as extracting a conflict-free set and a maximal set of admissible arguments.

arXiv:2506.00785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&amp;A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player (MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data, which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework, denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and implemented online deployment in the industry.

Abstract: We present an experimental study of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator based on a silicon oxynitride (SiON) photonic integrated arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). While AWG-based interrogators are compact and scalable, their practical performance is limited by non-ideal spectral responses. To address this, two calibration strategies within a 2.4 nm spectral region were compared: (1) a segmented analytical model based on a sigmoid fitting function, and (2) a machine learning (ML)-based regression model. The analytical method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.11 pm within the calibrated range, while the ML approach based on exponential regression achieves 3.17 pm. Moreover, the ML model demonstrates generalization across an extended 2.9 nm wavelength span, maintaining sub-5 pm accuracy without re-fitting. Residual and error distribution analyses further illustrate the trade-offs between the two approaches. ML-based calibration provides a robust, data-driven alternative to analytical methods, delivering enhanced accuracy for non-ideal channel responses, reduced manual calibration effort, and improved scalability across diverse FBG sensor configurations.

<title>A computationally frugal open-source foundation model for thoracic disease detection in lung cancer screening programs</title>

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening (LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning, thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000 thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases, while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management in high-risk populations.

arXiv:2507.03220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage, supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a 2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse lighting and weather conditions.

<title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>

arXiv:2507.04632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We release our training codebase on open-source data at https://github.com/microsoft/ArchScale.

<div> discursive network, erroneous information, peer review, Flaws-of-Others algorithm, epithesis
Summary: 
Large-language models (LLMs) create a discursive network where humans and software interact equally. Four hazards lead to erroneous information: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. A mathematical model shows that introducing peer review reduces error rates. The Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm operationalizes peer review by having agents critique each other and merge verdicts. Epithesis, an ethical transgression, occurs when humans disengage from the network. The key takeaway is that reliability in LLMs comes from connecting imperfect models into networks that promote mutual accountability. <div>

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We characterize this new medium as a discursive network that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. We define the generation of erroneous information as invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. We develop a general mathematical model of discursive networks that shows that a network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmonizer merges their verdicts. We identify an ethical transgression, epithesis, that occurs when humans fail to engage in the discursive network. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from connecting imperfect ones into networks that enforce mutual accountability.

Summary: <br />
Monolithic serving with chunked prefill improves GPU utilization by batching prefill and decode together, but suffers from fine-grained phase interference. Engine-level prefill-decode disaggregation avoids interference but incurs higher hardware and coordination overhead. GPU resources exhibit diminishing returns, with memory bandwidth contention becoming a critical bottleneck. Nexus dynamically partitions GPU resources across prefill and decode phases, considering compute capacity, memory footprint, and bandwidth contention.

Abstract: Monolithic serving with chunked prefill improves GPU utilization by batching prefill and decode together, but suffers from fine-grained phase interference. Engine-level prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation avoids interference but incurs higher hardware and coordination overhead. Prior intra-GPU disaggregation approaches multiplex prefill and decode within a single GPU, using SLO-based tuning guided by heuristics from offline profiling or reactive feedback loops. However, these methods respond reactively to performance issues rather than anticipating them, limiting adaptability under dynamic workloads.
  We ask: can we achieve proactive intra-GPU disaggregation that adapts effectively to dynamic workloads? The key challenge lies in managing the conflicting resource demands of prefill and decode under varying conditions. We first show that GPU resources exhibit diminishing returns -- beyond a saturation point, more allocation yields minimal latency benefit. Second, we observe that memory bandwidth contention becomes a critical bottleneck. These insights motivate a design that dynamically partitions GPU resources across prefill and decode phases, while jointly considering compute capacity, memory footprint, and bandwidth contention.
  Evaluated on diverse LLMs and workloads, our system Nexus achieves up to 2.2x higher throughput, 20x lower TTFT, and 2.5x lower TBT than vLLM; outperforms SGLang by up to 2x; and matches or exceeds disaggregated vLLM.

Summary:
Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) is proposed as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning for pre-trained language models. The study investigates the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, finding that a balanced weight distribution yields optimal performance. The research shows that traditional instruction tuning loss may result in suboptimal models and limited robustness to prompt variations. By adjusting the weights for prompt and response tokens, better-performing models can be achieved across different settings and serve as improved starting points for subsequent training. The findings emphasize the importance of reevaluating instruction tuning loss for developing more robust and generalizable language models. The open-source code for WIT is available at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models.

Summary:
In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, the tool-to-tool matching (TTTM) problem is crucial for ensuring efficient equipment operation. Traditional approaches rely on static configuration data or golden references, which are often unavailable in real-world manufacturing environments. This study introduces novel TTTM analysis pipelines to address these challenges, particularly in heterogeneous equipment settings. By examining data variance and modes, the researchers identify correlations that indicate equipment mismatches. Univariate methods show strong correlations with data variance and number of modes, demonstrating their effectiveness. Moreover, a multivariate approach achieves high correlation coefficients with top-performing univariate methods. The study also investigates the sensitivity of these multivariate algorithms to hyper-parameters, providing valuable insights for optimizing equipment matching processes. This research contributes valuable insights to enhance chamber matching in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line. Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting, where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes, respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm hyper-parameters.

<div> adaptive LR scheduler, deep neural networks, VolSched, CIFAR-100 dataset, generalization performance

Summary:<br /><br />Effective learning rate (LR) scheduling is essential for training deep neural networks. This paper introduces VolSched, an adaptive LR scheduler inspired by stochastic processes like Geometric Brownian Motion. VolSched dynamically adjusts the LR by considering the ratio between long-term and short-term accuracy volatility, helping the model escape plateaus and explore the loss landscape effectively. Evaluation on the CIFAR-100 dataset with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 shows consistent performance gains, with top-1 accuracy improvements of 1.4 and 1.3 percentage points, respectively. Analysis of loss curves reveals that VolSched promotes longer exploration phases. Quantitative analysis of the Hessian demonstrates that VolSched leads to a final solution that is 38% flatter than other baselines, resulting in wider minima and improved generalization performance. <div>

Abstract: Effective learning rate (LR) scheduling is crucial for training deep neural networks. However, popular pre-defined and adaptive schedulers can still lead to suboptimal generalization. This paper introduces VolSched, a novel adaptive LR scheduler inspired by the concept of volatility in stochastic processes like Geometric Brownian Motion to dynamically adjust the learning rate. By calculating the ratio between long-term and short-term accuracy volatility, VolSched increases the LR to escape plateaus and decreases it to stabilize training, allowing the model to explore the loss landscape more effectively. We evaluate VolSched on the CIFAR-100 dataset against a strong baseline using a standard augmentation pipeline. When paired with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, our scheduler delivers consistent performance gains, improving top-1 accuracy by 1.4 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. Analysis of the loss curves reveals that VolSched promotes a longer exploration phase. A quantitative analysis of the Hessian shows that VolSched finds a final solution that is 38% flatter than the next-best baseline, allowing the model to obtain wider minima and hence better generalization performance.

Abstract: Deep learning employs multi-layer neural networks trained via the backpropagation algorithm. This approach has achieved success across many domains and relies on adaptive gradient methods such as the Adam optimizer. Sequence modeling evolved from recurrent neural networks to attention-based models, culminating in the Transformer architecture. Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (for example, BERT and GPT-3) and have been applied in computer vision and computational biology. However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning, and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical implications of this result. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding of Transformer models and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Feature selection is vital for building effective predictive models, as it reduces dimensionality and emphasizes key features. However, current research often suffers from limited benchmarking and reliance on proprietary datasets. This severely hinders reproducibility and can negatively impact overall performance. To address these limitations, we introduce the MH-FSF framework, a comprehensive, modular, and extensible platform designed to facilitate the reproduction and implementation of feature selection methods. Developed through collaborative research, MH-FSF provides implementations of 17 methods (11 classical, 6 domain-specific) and enables systematic evaluation on 10 publicly available Android malware datasets. Our results reveal performance variations across both balanced and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the critical need for data preprocessing and selection criteria that account for these asymmetries. We demonstrate the importance of a unified platform for comparing diverse feature selection techniques, fostering methodological consistency and rigor. By providing this framework, we aim to significantly broaden the existing literature and pave the way for new research directions in feature selection, particularly within the context of Android malware detection.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware pseudo-labeling.
  This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF. It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling, drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel method, Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC), for addressing the challenge of deep graph clustering (DGC) for graphs with missing attributes. DTRGC utilizes a multi-step approach to impute missing node attributes, starting with nodes with sufficient neighborhood information and iteratively imputing more challenging nodes. The method, which includes Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) and Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI), leverages clustering information to refine imputation and correct errors. Additionally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) enriches node representations by integrating information across multiple hops. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DTRGC in improving the clustering performance of existing DGC methods on attribute-missing graphs. <div>
arXiv:2507.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently, Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors. Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC methods under attribute-missing graphs.

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement. Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56% in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore, through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by 14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in various physical design (PD) tasks. However, model generalizability remains limited by the availability of high-quality, large-scale training datasets. Creating such datasets is often computationally expensive and constrained by IP. While very few public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate, and require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD, a scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML in PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout heatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop, congestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a dataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts and placements. These heatmaps closely resemble real layouts and improve ML accuracy on downstream ML tasks such as IR drop or congestion prediction.

Summary: 
The study focuses on the impact of aerosol optical depth (AOD) on desalination processes in the UAE, where desalination plays a crucial role in meeting water needs. A novel two-stage predictive modeling approach is proposed to forecast AOD and predict desalination efficiency losses. The framework achieved high accuracy and identified key drivers of system degradation using SHAP analysis. Additionally, a dust-aware rule-based control logic is suggested to adjust plant operations based on predicted AOD values. To facilitate practical application, the research findings are integrated into an interactive dashboard for scenario and predictive analytics, supporting climate-adaptive planning and decision-making. This study provides a valuable tool for managing desalination plants amidst climate uncertainties, aiming to enhance efficiency and sustainability in water production. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) relies heavily on seawater desalination to meet over 90% of its drinking water needs. Desalination processes are highly energy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity consumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2 emissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges in the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures, salinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational and economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through photovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles.
  This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling architecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series and meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other meteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses. The framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study proposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based on predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to adjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance scheduling, and regulate energy source switching.
  To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive models and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for scenario and predictive analytics. This provides a management decision-support system for climate-adaptive planning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric, extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where performance improvements decelerate, which is a phenomenon known as sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling. High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information, while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms. However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality, then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover, we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings. These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.

<div> RL, SFT, large language models, maths, code

Summary:<br />
- The study compares reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on math problems using large language models (LLMs). RL shows minor in-domain gains on math problems but slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU. SFT exhibits similar trends but more pronounced. 
- Model analysis shows both algorithms heavily modify query and key weights, with SFT affecting mid-layer MLPs more. 
- SFT may cause out-of-domain degradation by replacing old skills with new ones. 
- Freezing parts of the model during training does not conclusively improve performance. 
- Overall, RL amplifies existing capabilities while SFT replaces old skills with new ones. <div>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

<div> Keywords: language models, algorithmic innovation, compute requirements, FLOP, AI progress <br />
Summary: 
This paper explores the impact of algorithmic innovations on the compute requirements for training large language models. It analyzes 36 pre-training algorithmic innovations and estimates the FLOP used in their development, revealing that resources for innovations requiring significant compute double annually. The study also investigates the potential effects of compute caps on AI algorithmic progress, finding that even strict limitations may not significantly impede innovation. For example, imposing a cap equivalent to training GPT-2 or limiting hardware capacity to 8 H100 GPUs could have still accommodated half of the innovations examined. Despite the increasing resources consumed by algorithmic advancements, the findings suggest that compute caps alone may not serve as a major hindrance to the progression of AI technology. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Algorithmic innovation in the pretraining of large language models has driven a massive reduction in the total compute required to reach a given level of capability. In this paper we empirically investigate the compute requirements for developing algorithmic innovations. We catalog 36 pre-training algorithmic innovations used in Llama 3 and DeepSeek-V3. For each innovation we estimate both the total FLOP used in development and the FLOP/s of the hardware utilized. Innovations using significant resources double in their requirements each year. We then use this dataset to investigate the effect of compute caps on innovation. Our analysis suggests that compute caps alone are unlikely to dramatically slow AI algorithmic progress. Even stringent compute caps -- such as capping total operations to the compute used to train GPT-2 or capping hardware capacity to 8 H100 GPUs -- could still have allowed for half of the cataloged innovations.

Abstract: The dynamic allocation of spectrum in 5G / 6G networks is critical to efficient resource utilization. However, applying traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is often infeasible due to its immense sample complexity and the safety risks associated with unguided exploration, which can cause severe network interference. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn a robust initial policy and rapidly adapt to new wireless scenarios with minimal data. We implement three meta-learning architectures, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention-enhanced RNN, and evaluate them against a non-meta-learning DRL algorithm, proximal policy optimization (PPO) baseline, in a simulated dynamic integrated access/backhaul (IAB) environment. Our results show a clear performance gap. The attention-based meta-learning agent reaches a peak mean network throughput of 48 Mbps, while the PPO baseline decreased drastically to 10 Mbps. Furthermore, our method reduces SINR and latency violations by more than 50% compared to PPO. It also shows quick adaptation, with a fairness index 0.7, showing better resource allocation. This work proves that meta-learning is a very effective and safer option for intelligent control in complex wireless systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for time series analytics, leveraging their massive parameters and the shared sequential nature of textual and time series data. However, a cross-modality gap exists between time series and textual data, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. In this tutorial, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLM-based cross-modal time series analytics. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into three groups based on cross-modal modeling strategies, e.g., conversion, alignment, and fusion, and then discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. In addition, we summarize several open challenges. This tutorial aims to expand the practical application of LLMs in solving real-world problems in cross-modal time series analytics while balancing effectiveness and efficiency. Participants will gain a thorough understanding of current advancements, methodologies, and future research directions in cross-modal time series analytics.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to weight space learning by incorporating structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. By modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem, the researchers propose a framework called gradient flow matching. This framework unifies various trajectory inference techniques and treats optimization paths as inductive bias. The study explores different architectural and algorithmic choices, such as reward fine-tuning, autoencoders for latent weight representation, and conditioning on task-specific context data. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves downstream training initialization, and supports fine-tuning for performance enhancement. Additionally, the method is applied to detect harmful covariate shifts in safety-critical systems, where it surpasses comparable baselines in performance. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces HIGFormer, a deep learning model for predicting soccer match outcomes that addresses the heterogeneous nature of player and team interactions. HIGFormer utilizes a multi-level interaction framework that includes a Player Interaction Network and a Team Interaction Network to capture player dynamics and team relationships. It also incorporates a Match Comparison Transformer to analyze information from both team and player levels for outcome prediction. Experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of HIGFormer compared to existing methods in soccer outcome prediction. The model's performance also offers insights for player performance evaluation, talent scouting, and team strategy analysis in soccer. <div>
arXiv:2507.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting soccer match outcomes is a challenging task due to the inherently unpredictable nature of the game and the numerous dynamic factors influencing results. While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction. However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation, offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.

Summary:
The paper introduces Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to address the challenge of training instability and efficiency in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs). GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by combining adaptive prompt refinement with direct imitation learning and exploration-based reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments on challenging mathematics benchmarks, GHPO outperformed on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines, achieving an average performance gain of approximately 5%.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

Summary: <br /> 
The paper introduces RFF-GP-HSMM, a novel unsupervised time-series segmentation method that incorporates random Fourier features to address the high computational cost of the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model (GP-HSMM). By approximating the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, the method eliminates the need for inverting the kernel matrix, significantly reducing the computational burden. Experimental results on the CMU motion-capture dataset show that the proposed approach achieves segmentation performance comparable to conventional methods, with a staggering 278 times faster segmentation on data consisting of 39,200 frames. This innovative method offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate time-series segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios with large-scale data where computational complexity is a paramount concern. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RFF-GP-HSMM, a fast unsupervised time-series segmentation method that incorporates random Fourier features (RFF) to address the high computational cost of the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model (GP-HSMM). GP-HSMM models time-series data using Gaussian processes, requiring inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix. Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces GeoHopNet, a novel approach for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points and supply stations in urban settings. It addresses computational complexity challenges by incorporating a distance-biased multi-head attention mechanism, K-nearest neighbor sparse attention, a modern Hopfield external memory module, and a memory regularization strategy. Experimental results show that GeoHopNet improves solution quality and speed compared to existing methods, particularly on large-scale instances with 1,000 nodes. It achieves high-quality solutions with a low optimality gap in under 0.1 seconds, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline. GeoHopNet extends the boundaries of solvable problem sizes in the context of UAV site location problems. The proposed approach offers a promising solution for efficiently handling complex urban-level location problems in the rapidly growing urban low-altitude UAV economy. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of urban low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) economy poses new challenges for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points and supply stations. Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with 1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3 seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.

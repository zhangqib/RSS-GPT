Abstract: In computational physics, a longstanding challenge lies in finding numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, research attention has increasingly focused on Neural Operator methods, which are notable for their ability to approximate operators-mappings between functions. Although neural operators benefit from a universal approximation theorem, achieving reliable error bounds often necessitates large model architectures, such as deep stacks of Fourier layers. This raises a natural question: Can we design lightweight models without sacrificing generalization? To address this, we introduce DimINO (Dimension-Informed Neural Operators), a framework inspired by dimensional analysis. DimINO incorporates two key components, DimNorm and a redimensionalization operation, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing neural operator architectures. These components enhance the model's ability to generalize across datasets with varying physical parameters. Theoretically, we establish a universal approximation theorem for DimINO and prove that it satisfies a critical property we term Similar Transformation Invariance (STI). Empirically, DimINO achieves up to 76.3% performance gain on PDE datasets while exhibiting clear evidence of the STI property.

<div> Keywords: linear quadratic regulator, uncertain disturbances, adaptive dynamic programming, stability, convergence<br />
Summary:<br />
The article focuses on offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies in the presence of uncertain disturbances. It examines scenarios where disturbances can be estimated in a controlled environment and when they are unknown in a stochastic setting. The approach combines adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to develop algorithms and sample-based approximations inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) principles. For scenarios involving non-measurable disturbances, stability and convergence guarantees for learned control gains are established under sample-based approximations. The methodology aims for simplicity while providing robust guarantees. Numerical experiments validate the design of offline continuous-time LQR with exogenous disturbances, highlighting the intricacies involved in the process. <div>

Abstract: We analyze offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies with uncertain disturbances. First, we consider the scenario where the exogenous variable can be estimated in a controlled environment, and subsequently, consider a more practical and challenging scenario where it is unknown in a stochastic setting. Our approach builds on the fundamental learning-based framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), combined with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to design the algorithms and derive sample-based approximations motivated from the Markov decision process (MDP)-based approaches. For the scenario involving non-measurable disturbances, we further establish stability and convergence guarantees for the learned control gains under sample-based approximations. The overall methodology emphasizes simplicity while providing rigorous guarantees. Finally, numerical experiments focus on the intricacies and validations for the design of offline continuous-time LQR with exogenous disturbances.

<div> diffusion model, zeolites, synthesis, generative, structure-synthesis

Summary:
DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model, is introduced to tackle the challenge of synthesizing crystalline materials like zeolites. The model is trained on a vast dataset of synthesis recipes and can generate probable synthesis routes based on a desired zeolite structure and organic template. DiffSyn's performance is top-notch as it can capture the complex structure-synthesis relationships. This model is utilized to distinguish between competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. In a successful demonstration, DiffSyn is used to synthesize a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ ratio of 19.0, which surpasses previous records and is expected to enhance thermal stability. The rationalization of the synthesis routes via density functional theory binding energies adds a layer of credibility to the process. <div>
arXiv:2509.17094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. DiffSyn generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. DiffSyn achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply DiffSyn to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using DiffSyn-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.

<div> Distribution Compression, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Bilateral Distribution Compression, Decoded MMD, Low-Dimensional Projection

Summary:
Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC) is proposed as a two-stage framework for compressing large datasets while preserving the underlying distribution. BDC operates with linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. The Decoded MMD (DMMD) is introduced to quantify the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC utilizes the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD) to learn a low-dimensional projection and the Encoded MMD (EMMD) to optimize a latent compressed set. By minimizing the DMMD, BDC ensures that the compressed set accurately represents the original distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at a significantly lower cost. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.

<div> decision trees, Rashomon set, predictive equivalence, Quine-McCluskey method, DNF representation

Summary: In this paper, the researchers address the issue of redundancy in decision trees within the Rashomon set and its implications on feature importance and accuracy. They introduce the MBDSR approach, utilizing the Quine-McCluskey method to determine predictive equivalence among decision trees. However, they find that the QM method can exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space for certain decision trees. They demonstrate that the MBDSR approach may produce incorrect results in some cases and propose algorithms that can solve related problems in polynomial time. Through experiments, they show that their algorithms are significantly faster than previous methods for decision trees triggering worst-case scenarios with the QM method. This research highlights the importance of efficient methods for decision tree analysis and provides solutions for improving accuracy and computational efficiency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach, which this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that, depending on the QM method implementation, the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the problem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Generative flow networks are extended to multi-agent settings with the introduction of MA-GFlowNets, allowing collaborative object generation through joint actions. A theoretical framework for MA-GFlowNets is presented, along with four algorithms: centralized, independent, joint, and updated conditional flow networks. The joint flow network employs a local-global principle for training multiple local networks as a single global network, ensuring efficient training and theoretical guarantees on sample generation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework over traditional reinforcement learning and MCMC methods. <div>
arXiv:2509.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of (local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement learning and MCMC-based methods.

Summary:
FastEagle is introduced as a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that can generate an entire draft in a single forward pass, compared to state-of-the-art drafters like EAGLE that require sequential passes. By using a layer cascade and training with layer-wise supervision, FastEagle minimizes error accumulation. It utilizes a constrained draft tree to maintain lossless verification cost. FastEagle outperforms EAGLE-3 in terms of speedup under both greedy and stochastic decoding, while maintaining competitive acceptance lengths. Testing on various large language models (LLMs) and tasks shows that FastEagle consistently delivers faster inference times without sacrificing quality, indicating that eliminating sequential dependencies in drafting can significantly accelerate LLM generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation. Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior. Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM, Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths. These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

<div> machine learning, ozone variability, climate models, UKESM, ICON

Summary: 
- The study introduces a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to model daily ozone variability and trends in climate models lacking interactive ozone representation due to high computational costs.
- mloz exhibits high fidelity on decadal timescales and can be used online in both UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and German ICON model, producing stable ozone predictions 31 times faster than traditional chemistry schemes.
- Using only atmospheric temperature data as input, mloz accounts for less than 4 percent of total climate model runtimes.
- The parameterization is transferable between different climate models, demonstrating potential adoption in CMIP-level models that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments.
- Particularly beneficial for climate sensitivity simulations, mloz can capture ozone trends and variability that significantly influence atmospheric feedback processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes. Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31 times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4 percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments, particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback processes.

Summary:
The article discusses the privacy concerns related to Electroencephalography (EEG) data and the potential risks of re-identification and leakage of personal information. To address these challenges, a transformer-based autoencoder is proposed to anonymize EEG data while maintaining its utility for machine learning tasks. The study focuses on automatic sleep staging as an application and evaluates the effectiveness of the anonymization technique in reducing the re-identifiability of EEG signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the risk of re-identification while still preserving the data's utility for machine learning applications. This finding highlights the importance of safeguarding sensitive EEG data from potential privacy breaches while also enabling its use in beneficial applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications. To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced while preserving its utility for machine learning.

In this study, the researchers investigate the vulnerability of memorization-based influence estimators to adversarial attacks. They demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating memorization scores by proposing a practical attack method involving the calculation of the pseudoinverse of the input data. The attack, which only requires black-box access to model outputs, is shown to be effective across various image classification tasks. The researchers also analyze the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, highlighting the fragility of influence estimates in certain conditions. These findings underscore the significance of addressing vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and emphasize the importance of implementing robust defenses in machine learning systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack (calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MemAttack-5413/

<div> contrastive representations, temporal distances, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, successor representations, quasimetric distance

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) that combines contrastive representations and temporal distances. By utilizing a quasimetric representation space with additional constraints, the proposed method can learn optimal goal-reaching policies even in suboptimal data and stochastic environments. This approach bridges the gap between the stability of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods and the flexibility of quasimetric network parameterizations. Empirical results show that the new representation learning objective enhances performance on stitching tasks where contrastive learning methods struggle, as well as in noisy, high-dimensional environments where quasimetric network methods encounter challenges. Overall, the unified framework offers improved capabilities for solving goal-reaching tasks with a combination of stability and adaptability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.

A gating network filters out noisy channels to enhance data reliability. A novel loss function combines supervised and contrastive learning for improved generalization.

arXiv:2509.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species, autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization through innovative architectural and loss design.

<div> Keywords: clustering, rule-guided, multimodal, domain-specific constraints, variational autoencoder

Summary: 
The Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE) introduces a rule-guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain-specific constraints into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data-driven features into a unified latent space, enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. By treating rules as first-class learning signals and integrating them into the clustering process, DARTVAE produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets show that rule-guided clustering improves traditional clustering metrics and yields more meaningful clusters, such as isolating UAVs or separating SUVs from sedans. However, challenges include rule hallucinations, overfitting, and scalability issues. DARTVAE demonstrates the utility of constraint-guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge-intensive domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models, highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge intensive settings.

The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Summary: 
This paper presents a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent full-field damage in concrete using an auto-regressive U-Net model combined with a convolutional neural network. The model predicts the evolution of the damage field in a unit cell based on microstructural geometry and shrinkage profile. By using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent predictions, the model allows for continuous assessment of damage progression. Additionally, a CNN forecasts key mechanical properties, such as observed shrinkage and residual stiffness, based on the damage estimations. The dual-network architecture shows high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on synthesized datasets. This approach reduces the computational burden of full-field damage evaluations and offers insights into the relationship between aggregate properties and effective shrinkage and stiffness reduction. Overall, this method can aid in optimizing concrete mix designs for improved durability and reduced internal damage.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape, size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness. Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved durability and reduced internal damage.

<div> keywords: Policy gradient methods, entropy maximization, complexity bonus, Proximal Policy Optimization, CDPO

Summary: 
Policy gradient methods often use entropy maximization to balance exploration and exploitation. However, this approach can result in inefficient exploration strategies as it pushes policies towards a uniform random distribution. In response, this work proposes using a complexity bonus instead of entropy. The complexity bonus is a combination of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, encouraging policies that strike a balance between stochasticity and structure. This new approach, named Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), is shown to be more robust to changes in the complexity coefficient compared to traditional methods using entropy coefficients. CDPO promotes the discovery of structured yet adaptable strategies, making it especially effective in environments that require significant exploration. <div>

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity (high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially in environments requiring greater exploration.

Summary: 
This article presents a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms used in recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements in inverse problems. The algorithms are interpreted as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections, particularly effective when the data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set. By assuming a restricted isometry property of the sensing matrix over the model set, the study establishes quantitative convergence rates that depend on the noise schedule. The framework is applied to uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets, and low-rank Gaussian mixture models, demonstrating global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set. <div>

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors, but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set, we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions: uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Summary: 
Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs) are a novel concept bottleneck model that combines an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic reasoning circuit to produce interpretable predictions. However, NPCs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate attribute predictions. This paper analyzes the adversarial robustness of NPCs and introduces RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit that improves adversarial robustness by integrating outputs from both modules in a class-wise manner. The theoretical analysis shows that RNPC is more resilient to attacks compared to NPCs. Empirical results on image classification tasks demonstrate that RNPC achieves superior robustness against adversarial inputs while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.

Summary: 
The study compares two hybrid classifiers, XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR), for diabetes risk stratification. XGB-RF outperformed SVM-LR in both internal and external cohorts, achieving higher AUROC and AUPRC values. The performance of XGB-RF remained strong on the external PIMA cohort, with acceptable calibration. Thresholded metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 showed XGB-RF had higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score compared to SVM-LR. The results support the use of XGBoost-based hybridization as a robust and transferable approach for diabetes risk prediction. Prospective multi-site validation and deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs are recommended for further research.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and (ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe, standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC ~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990; AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941; Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall 0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach for physics-informed generation by framing it as a sparse reward optimization problem. The authors propose Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF) to address issues with prior methods that rely on diffusion posterior sampling. PIRF calculates trajectory-level rewards and directly backpropagates their gradients to ensure adherence to physical constraints. To enhance efficiency, PIRF utilizes a layer-wise truncated backpropagation method tailored to physics-based rewards and a weight-based regularization scheme for improved data fidelity. Results across five PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIRF consistently outperforms existing methods in enforcing physical constraints while maintaining efficient sampling. This study showcases the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific generative modeling. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However, a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes, highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific generative modeling.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian Neural Networks, uncertainty quantification, hyperparameters, global sensitivity analysis, Bayesian optimization

Summary:
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) aim to provide predictive uncertainty in scientific applications, helping to identify when a model may be extrapolating or when more data is needed. However, accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) with BNNs can be challenging due to the complexity of hyperparameter choices and the approximations used in model training. A global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under various hyperparameter settings revealed that hyperparameters interact to impact both predictive accuracy and UQ. To enhance the practical use of BNNs, it is recommended to use global sensitivity analysis or Bayesian optimization to reduce dimensionality and select hyperparameters effectively. By improving hyperparameter selection, researchers can ensure accurate UQ in Bayesian Neural Networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective representations.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel class of stable and near-reversible Runge-Kutta schemes for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes offer memory-efficient training without sacrificing stability, allowing for accurate gradient computations in a scalable manner. Previous approaches to backpropagation through neural SDE solvers have been hindered by either high memory costs or slow evaluation speeds, but the EES schemes aim to overcome these limitations by combining the benefits of reversible solvers with improved stability. By demonstrating superior performance in numerical experiments, the EES schemes prove to be a practical foundation for effectively training neural SDEs, enabling efficient and accurate gradient computations even in complex models with large step sizes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs. These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Summary:
Function encoders, a novel technique, learn neural network basis functions to create adaptive representations of function Hilbert spaces. They establish a connection to feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through the learned feature map's inner product. This kernel perspective explains their ability to scale independently of dataset size while conforming to data structure, enabling kernel-style analysis of neural models. Two training algorithms are developed: a progressive approach that incrementally builds bases and a train-then-prune method post-training. Both use PCA principles to reveal the learned space's intrinsic dimension. Generalization bounds are derived using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques, ensuring inference time guarantees. Experimental validation on polynomial and nonlinear dynamical systems illustrates achieving comparable accuracy with fewer basis functions. This research paves the way for neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, delivering adaptable, efficient, and principled models at scale.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and principled at scale.

Summary: 
Mutual information (MI) is a challenging quantity to estimate for complex systems, but denoising diffusion models have shown promise in improving this estimation. By utilizing the information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, this study demonstrates a straightforward approach to estimating MI. The MI is calculated as half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. This method not only passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. Additionally, adaptive importance sampling is leveraged to achieve scalable MI estimation, maintaining strong performance even at high MI values. Overall, the use of denoising diffusion models offers a promising avenue for improving mutual information estimation in complex systems.

arXiv:2509.20609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI. In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong performance even when the MI is high.

However, evolving skills may not be compatible with existing policies, limiting their reusability. The SIL-C framework addresses this issue by ensuring compatibility between evolving skills and policies without the need for re-training. It uses a mapping technique to align subtask space with skill space, allowing each subtask to be executed efficiently by selecting the right skill. SIL-C was tested in various scenarios and proved to maintain compatibility while enhancing performance. <div>

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies, limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C, a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring efficiency throughout the learning process.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenges in training Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex multi-turn task planning. By transforming the multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems and utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense reward from expert trajectories, the proposed method achieves efficient policy optimization. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning leads to higher success probability in multi-turn tasks under minimal turns and generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental results show that a 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO outperforms larger baseline models up to 14B parameters in complex task planning, achieving success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. The strong cross-task generalizability is validated, showing that models trained on complex tasks can successfully complete all simpler subtasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler subtasks.

Summary:
Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL) is a novel federated learning framework that addresses data privacy constraints in multi-site functional MRI studies. It enables collaborative modeling without sharing raw data by performing independent dictionary learning at each site. PFedDL decomposes site-specific dictionaries into shared global components and personalized local components. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to ensure cross-site consistency, while the local atoms capture site-specific variability. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset show that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets. This innovative approach allows for more efficient and effective analysis of neuroimaging data while respecting data privacy constraints.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site, decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets.

Summary: 
The paper explores the use of Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) in music conversation and investigates if these models truly listen to audio or rely on textual reasoning. They implement the MM-SHAP framework to quantify the contribution of each modality to the model's output on the MuChoMusic benchmark. The study reveals that models with higher accuracy tend to rely more on text for answering questions. However, even when the overall audio contribution is low, models can still effectively identify key sound events, indicating that audio is not completely disregarded. This research is the first to apply MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs, paving the way for future studies in explainable AI and audio analysis.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low, models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in explainable AI and audio.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent reinforcement learning, artificial curiosity, exploration, intrinsic motivation, decentralized settings

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework called CERMIC that aims to improve exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios with sparse rewards. Existing artificial curiosity mechanisms often fail to distinguish between true novelty and stochastic environmental variability, leading to suboptimal exploration. CERMIC addresses this issue by dynamically adjusting agents' intrinsic curiosity based on multi-agent context, allowing them to filter out irrelevant surprises. This framework generates intrinsic rewards that incentivize agents to explore state transitions that provide significant information gain. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that exploration with CERMIC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward environments, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing multi-agent exploration in communication-free decentralized settings. <div>
arXiv:2509.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on using machine learning to predict the resources needed for massively parallel chemistry computations, specifically coupled-cluster methods, to assist users in planning experiments on supercomputers. The research addresses two main questions: finding the optimal parameter configurations for shortest execution time and minimizing resource usage. By evaluating various ML models and strategies using data from CCSD application runs on DOE's Frontier and Aurora supercomputers, the study achieves a high level of accuracy in predicting execution times. A Gradient Boosting model performs well in predicting CCSD iteration times on both supercomputers, with minimal errors. Additionally, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using active learning to reduce the number of experiments needed to collect data points, producing accurate predictions with a limited number of data samples. <div>
arXiv:2509.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE) Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from Aurora and Frontier.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a non-asymptotic lower bound linking the minimal number of demonstrations required for stable in-context learning (ICL) to prompt length sensitivity. It establishes explicit sufficient conditions based on the spectral properties of covariance, offering a practical criterion for implementation. The proposed two-stage observable estimator, with one-shot calibration, provides prompt-length estimates without distributional priors. Experimental results demonstrate the close alignment between predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with the theory acting as a reliable upper bound. Furthermore, the calibrated variant tightens this gap, enhancing the interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in finite-sample regimes. This research connects spectral coverage to stable ICL, bridging theory with deployment, and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of large-scale prompt-based learning systems.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance, providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic finite-sample regimes.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning, graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class or content.

<br />
Summary: In the study, the authors explore the use of federated learning (FL) for collaborative fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) while preserving privacy. Despite the belief that FL protects privacy by aggregating generalized knowledge in a global model, the findings reveal that attackers can still extract training data from the model. This privacy leakage increases with the model size and can be exacerbated by an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL. To address these privacy risks, the study evaluates various techniques including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates, and safety alignment in LLMs. These results offer valuable insights and practical guidelines for organizations looking to mitigate privacy risks when fine-tuning LLMs using federated learning. <div>
arXiv:2509.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains. Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Summary: 
FIRM-DTI is a new framework for accurately predicting drug-target binding affinity using deep learning. It combines molecular and protein embeddings using a feature-wise linear modulation layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss, resulting in smooth and interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its small size, FIRM-DTI outperforms existing models on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark. An extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation demonstrate its effectiveness. This framework highlights the importance of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction. <div>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening. While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark, as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation. Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

Summary:
SynGA is a genetic algorithm specifically designed to operate directly on synthesis routes in molecular design. It features custom crossover and mutation operators that ensure synthesizability of the generated molecules, making it effective for various design tasks like synthesizable analog search and property optimization in both 2D and 3D dimensions. By modifying the fitness function and coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter for building blocks, the algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. SynGBO, a variant of SynGA, combines it with block filtering in Bayesian optimization for efficient property optimization. Due to its lightweight nature and inherent focus on synthesizability, SynGA can serve as a strong standalone baseline and be seamlessly integrated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future. <div>
arXiv:2509.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

<div> Keywords: scaling laws, deep learning, redundancy laws, data covariance spectrum, model performance<br />
Summary:<br />
The study explores the mathematical underpinnings of scaling laws in deep learning, uncovering a connection to redundancy laws. By employing kernel regression, the researchers demonstrate that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum leads to an excess risk power law with a specific exponent. This exponent is determined by the spectral tail parameter beta, reflecting the level of redundancy in the data. The slope of the learning curve is shown to depend on data redundancy, with steeper spectra resulting in accelerated returns to scale. The universality of these findings is validated across various transformations, mixtures, approximations, and architectures, including Transformer models. This work provides a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.

<div> Keywords: audio watermarking, anti-spoofing systems, domain shift, Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning, benchmark

Summary:
This paper introduces a study on the impact of audio watermarking on anti-spoofing systems. By creating the Watermark-Spoofing dataset with various watermarking techniques, the researchers found that watermarking consistently decreases the performance of anti-spoofing systems, with higher watermark density leading to higher error rates. To address this issue, they propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, allowing models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while maintaining their original spoofing detection capability. These results highlight audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and provide a benchmark for developing anti-spoofing systems resilient to watermarks. The related protocols can be accessed at https://github.com/Alphawarheads/Watermark_Spoofing.git.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets, named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

Summary:
The study compares Transformer-based models GReaT and REaLTabFormer for synthetic tabular data generation. It evaluates the impact of hyperparameters on runtime, machine learning utility, and similarity to real data distributions across different model setups. Results show that runtime increases with the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT outperforms REaLTabFormer in runtime efficiency, but REaLTabFormer maintains high utility and similarity on larger datasets. REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs strikes the best balance between data quality and computational requirements. Despite efficiency gains, there is a limit to reducing runtime. The study suggests that lightweight LLMs can enhance efficiency without compromising data quality for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

<div> machine learning, learned indexes, dynamic updates, retraining cost, Sig2Model

Summary: 
Sig2Model is a novel approach to efficient and adaptive learned indexing that addresses the challenges of dynamic updates. By utilizing a sigmoid boosting approximation technique, the index model can be dynamically adjusted to account for shifts in data distribution without the need for full retraining, reducing retraining costs. Proactive update training using Gaussian mixture models allows for strategic placeholder allocation in high-update-probability regions, further speeding up updates. A neural joint optimization framework continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters, improving overall performance. In evaluations against existing approaches, Sig2Model demonstrated a reduction in retraining cost by up to 20x, achieved up to 3x higher queries-per-second (QPS), and used significantly less memory, making it a promising solution for real-world workloads with frequent updates. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS) metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively, rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS, and uses up to 1000x less memory.

Summary:
- The article introduces a novel approach that combines multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to improve multivariate time-series forecasting.
- MLP models are effective in capturing long-term dependencies but struggle with diverse distributions and local variations in data.
- CNNs are better at incorporating these variations, so the proposed model combines MLP for overall trend modeling and CNN for capturing fine-grained local patterns.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions, resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

Summary:
This article discusses the challenge of data efficiency in large-scale models due to the finite nature of high-quality data. It introduces a framework to improve data efficiency by formalizing the inductive bias of linear time-invariant State Space Models (SSMs) through an SSM-induced kernel. The method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI) is proposed, specifically power spectrum matching, to align the model's bias with the task's spectral characteristics before training. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TDI significantly enhances generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data scenarios. This work presents a theoretical and practical approach to developing more data-efficient models, contributing to the sustainable scaling of machine learning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge. One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

Summary:
Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer robustness from teacher to student without accessing training data. However, existing methods overlook robust fairness issues, causing significant variation in robustness across different categories. Two key problems were identified: variations in student behavior across categories with equal class proportions and instability of student robustness across different attack targets. To address these issues, Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework was introduced. FERD adjusts the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples by implementing robustness-guided class reweighting and generating Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) and Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs). Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under various adversarial attacks, improving robustness and fairness simultaneously.<br /><br />Summary: Data-Free Robustness Distillation transfers robustness but neglects fairness, leading to disparities. FERD addresses this by adjusting proportions and distributions of adversarial examples, improving worst-class robustness and fairness simultaneously. <div>

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and (2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack (e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by 15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Summary: 
The article introduces T2I-Diff, a framework for generating fMRI data that addresses the limitations of existing generative models. By leveraging time-frequency representation and classifier-free denoising diffusion, T2I-Diff captures complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. The framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms using a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. A classifier-free diffusion model is then trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are converted back to BOLD signals. The efficacy of the approach is validated through improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.<br />

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning. CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&amp;A tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style. Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models.

<br />Summary: 
This work aims to explain late-phase phenomena in deep neural networks, such as grokking and the information bottleneck principle. The authors propose a unified explanation based on the concept of neural collapse, which involves the contraction of population within-class variance in learned representations. They show that this measure is key to understanding both grokking and the information bottleneck effect. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, the authors demonstrate that the differences in time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse can account for the behavior of late-phase phenomena. The theoretical findings are validated on various datasets and neural network architectures. <div>
arXiv:2509.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal fusion, effective competitive strength, mutual information, FastPID, asynchronous training

Summary:
In the study, a two-stage training framework is proposed to address modality competition in multi-modal fusion. The concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) is introduced to quantify a modality's dominance during training. The framework utilizes mutual information (MI) as a proxy for ECS and develops the FastPID solver for partial information decomposition. An asynchronous training controller dynamically balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and synergy. By shaping the initial states through unimodal training, the method achieves a tighter error bound and better performance in multi-modal fusion tasks. The approach proves to be effective in mitigating modality competition and enhancing synergy among different modalities. The experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method in multi-modal fusion tasks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of pre-fusion model initialization in optimizing multi-modal fusion. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state, most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples, including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them. Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches, and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

<div> Keywords: Time series generation, conditional models, causal perspective, CaTSG, interventions, counterfactuals

Summary: 
This article introduces the concept of causal time series generation (CaTSG), which goes beyond traditional conditional models by considering unobserved confounding and incorporating interventions and counterfactual scenarios. The CaTSG framework utilizes Pearl's causal ladder to guide the generation process, allowing for the creation of realistic time series sequences under different causal conditions. By incorporating backdoor adjustment and causal score functions, CaTSG can generate sequences that accurately reflect the effects of interventions and individual counterfactuals. Experimental results demonstrate that CaTSG outperforms existing baselines in terms of fidelity and support for interventional and counterfactual generation. The proposed causal TSG family and the CaTSG framework represent a novel approach to time series synthesis, offering promising possibilities for more reliable simulation in various causal scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings. To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation.

<div> Keywords: newborns, artificial intelligence, fetal heart rate monitoring, missing data, autoencoder<br />
Summary:<br />
Approximately 10% of newborns require breathing assistance at birth, and 5% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is crucial for assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care and detecting abnormal patterns. AI methods can analyze large FHR datasets to predict the risk of interventions. Wearable FHR monitors allow continuous monitoring but face signal dropouts due to sensor displacement. The proposed masked transformer-based autoencoder can reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing spatial and frequency components, preserving spectral characteristics. This approach is robust for varying durations of missing data, enabling signal inpainting and forecasting. It can be applied to research datasets for developing AI-based risk algorithms and potentially integrated into wearable FHR monitors for early risk detection. <br /><br />Summary: 
- Newborns often need breathing assistance at birth, with FHR monitoring being critical for fetal well-being assessment.
- AI analysis of FHR data can predict the need for interventions based on diverse outcomes.
- Wearable FHR monitors face signal dropouts, which the proposed autoencoder can reconstruct robustly.
- This approach preserves signal characteristics and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated (AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more robust risk detection.

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines, especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts. However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

<title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays</title>

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

<title>Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877</link>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution. Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance, alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for global imbalance.

<title>Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated, attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction, trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons, enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model. During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance (with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and organizational overhead.

arXiv:2509.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

<title>Deep Learning for Crime Forecasting: The Role of Mobility at Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Scales</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20913</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to 2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq. miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance, especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision, and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes, while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency, with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve (PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve. The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid, implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

<title>Why Attention Fails: The Degeneration of Transformers into MLPs in Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments, progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon, demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

<title>Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations</title>

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values. Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture, showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

<title>Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy</title>

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via 'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing individualized treatments for patients.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

<title>Toward Robust and Efficient ML-Based GPU Caching for Modern Inference</title>

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S \subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto \exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$ that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for $k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without [Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA '24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC '19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the truncated Ising model.

<title>Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor.

<title>Feature Augmentation of GNNs for ILPs: Local Uniqueness Suffices</title>

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method.

<title>Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation</title>

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows. However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

<title>ExMolRL: Phenotype-Target Joint Generation of De Novo Molecules via Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse, and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective solution for de novo drug discovery.

<title>Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.

<title>Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

<title>DELTA-Code: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Programming Algorithms in LLMs?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21016</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<title>Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks, which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse, multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL.

<title>FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities. In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability, failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.

<title>Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs</title>

arXiv:2509.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

Efficient learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations. Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning $\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the stationary trajectories.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving. Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization, SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model, which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between "Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code: https://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both. TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

<title>Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as \textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs) to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence. The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

<title>EvoMail: Self-Evolving Cognitive Agents for Adaptive Spam and Phishing Email Defense</title>

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting.

<title>LAVA: Explainability for Unsupervised Latent Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However, without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities (neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly distant regions of the latent spaces.

<title>CAD-Tokenizer: Towards Text-based CAD Prototyping via Modality-Specific Tokenization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline. However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

<title>GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost.

<title>DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective, relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>Mixture of Thoughts: Learning to Aggregate What Experts Think, Not Just What They Say</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21164</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain (e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i) route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii) aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii) fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity. We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further, MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jacobfa/mot.

<title>A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model. While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities, existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences, that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

<title>Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

<title>Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy</title>

arXiv:2509.21190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics: local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper, we propose the {\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral {\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection, anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation, and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions, simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making. Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain generalization techniques ...

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art. Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization. This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT, which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance comparable to the centralized baseline.

Abstract: There has been a considerable interest in constrained training of deep neural networks (DNNs) recently for applications such as fairness and safety. Several toolkits have been proposed for this task, yet there is still no industry standard. We present humancompatible.train (https://github.com/humancompatible/train), an easily-extendable PyTorch-based Python package for training DNNs with stochastic constraints. We implement multiple previously unimplemented algorithms for stochastically constrained stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the toolkit use by comparing two algorithms on a deep learning task with fairness constraints.

<title>A Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Model for Multi-Region and Multi-Pollutant Air Quality Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health, environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

<title>SuperOffload: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale LLM Training on Superchips</title>

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package, which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently. SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems, enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of 13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while achieving 55% MFU.

<title>It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

<title>Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment, invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models), most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm. However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

<title>No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions, portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set, rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance. Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks. Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact, less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization in this setting.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting, and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates, and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for healthcare.

Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.

Abstract: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible PhIML.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages. Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin) corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion representation.

<title>Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Abstract: ECG biometrics offer a unique, secure authentication method, yet their deployment on wearable devices faces real-time processing, privacy, and spoofing vulnerability challenges. This paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model (MobileNetV1+GRU) for ECG-based authentication, injection of 20dB Gaussian noise & custom preprocessing. We simulate wearable conditions and edge deployment using the ECGID, MIT-BIH, CYBHi, and PTB datasets, achieving accuracies of 99.34%, 99.31%, 91.74%, and 98.49%, F1-scores of 0.9869, 0.9923, 0.9125, and 0.9771, Precision of 0.9866, 0.9924, 0.9180 and 0.9845, Recall of 0.9878, 0.9923, 0.9129, and 0.9756, equal error rates (EER) of 0.0009, 0.00013, 0.0091, and 0.0009, and ROC-AUC values of 0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9985, and 0.9998, while under FGSM adversarial attacks, accuracy drops from 96.82% to as low as 0.80%. This paper highlights federated learning, adversarial testing, and the need for diverse wearable physiological datasets to ensure secure and scalable biometrics.

<title>A Comparative Analysis of Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Approaches with Explainable AI for Multi-Class Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks</title>

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types. Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME, were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance, enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical drone operations.

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+ deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations. These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama 8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints, representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic deception contexts.

<title>Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics</title>

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional numerical simulations in the future.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work, we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set, and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical applications. Code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/conformal-importance-summarization.

Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

<title>Fast Estimation of Wasserstein Distances via Regression on Sliced Wasserstein Distances</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole, particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.

<title>Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520</link>

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands, thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments.

<title>A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition</title>

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme. Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the literature.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of 96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72 sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent, underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy. When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2% and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual benchmark.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

<title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with an Unobservable Source Subpopulation</title>

Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model. Our open-source code and data is released at https://github.com/chipermaria/every-character-counts.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge. This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models (LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment, retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and democratize network control for everyday users.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph databases, and user interfaces -- interconnected via web-based APIs. While these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments, such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers. In this paper, we share our experience deploying GenAI workloads within an established HPC center, discussing the integration of HPC and cloud computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads, helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM) across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC container community, guiding future research and tool development.

We demonstrate that covering numbers for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped dimensions, generalizing the results of \cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of convergence in statistical and online learning.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality. The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together, these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Abstract: As software systems grow in scale and complexity, understanding the distribution of programming language topics within source code becomes increasingly important for guiding technical decisions, improving onboarding, and informing tooling and education. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75 in code-topic highlight. Our findings contribute empirical insights and a reusable pipeline for researchers and practitioners interested in code analysis and data-driven software engineering.

Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS, and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying, whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error. We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware super-resolution.

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN) can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN. Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication; and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et. al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors, laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their potential for practical applications.

Abstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel, audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup, with clean speech playback through headphones.

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i) an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of biomanufacturing processes.

Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&amp;A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&amp;A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight. MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

<title>ImaginationPolicy: Towards Generalizable, Precise and Reliable End-to-End Policy for Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks, multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Actively Learning Halfspaces without Synthetic Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20848</link>

Abstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal $\widetilde{O}(d \log n)$ query algorithm is known due to Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in fact without this power there is an $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).
  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound, we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size $D$, and show tight bounds of $\Theta(D + \log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain an optimal $O(d + \log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$. In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$ provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.
  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\min(D + \log(1/\varepsilon), 1/\varepsilon) \cdot \log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error $\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a $c\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This bound is optimal up to a $\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting.

<title>Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats: choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.

Abstract: Reverse differentiation is an essential operation for automatic differentiation. Cartesian reverse differential categories axiomatize reverse differentiation in a categorical framework, where one of the primary axioms is the reverse chain rule, which is the formula that expresses the reverse derivative of a composition. Here, we present the reverse differential analogue of Faa di Bruno's Formula, which gives a higher-order reverse chain rule in a Cartesian reverse differential category. To properly do so, we also define partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives in a Cartesian reverse differential category.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining, clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.

Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations. Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time, spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite. Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact, quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

<title>RollPacker: Mitigating Long-Tail Rollouts for Fast, Synchronous RL Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5 family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort, outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly central to many applications, raising concerns about bias, fairness, and regulatory compliance. This paper reviews risks of biased outputs and their societal impact, focusing on frameworks like the EU's AI Act and the Digital Services Act. We argue that beyond constant regulation, stronger attention to competition and design governance is needed to ensure fair, trustworthy AI. This is a preprint of the Communications of the ACM article of the same title.

<title>Are Modern Speech Enhancement Systems Vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks?</title>

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.

<title>Best-of-$\infty$ -- Asymptotic Performance of Test-Time Compute</title>

Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$, which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs, showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.

<title>The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while keeping raw data decentralized, making it a conduit for leveraging the power of IoT devices while maintaining privacy of the locally collected data. However, existing privacy- preserving techniques present notable hurdles. Methods such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential Privacy (DP) often incur high compu- tational costs and suffer from limited scalability. This survey examines emerging approaches that hold promise for enhancing both privacy and efficiency in FL, including Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Quantum Computing (QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues, offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

<title>WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective</title>

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text. Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a modern and pertinent problem.

<title>Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy</title>

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

<title>Breaking the curse of dimensionality for linear rules: optimal predictors over the ellipsoid</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X) Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules -- encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators, including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&amp;R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&amp;R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&amp;R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions. The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions. Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al. (2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel hyperparameters.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches. Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research domains.

<title>Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?</title>

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural information about how movements relate to one another, this information is frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

We also show that maxout polytopes are cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Abstract: First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.

Abstract: We consider a contextual bandit problem with a combinatorial action set and time-varying base arm availability. At the beginning of each round, the agent observes the set of available base arms and their contexts and then selects an action that is a feasible subset of the set of available base arms to maximize its cumulative reward in the long run. We assume that the mean outcomes of base arms are samples from a Gaussian Process (GP) indexed by the context set ${\cal X}$, and the expected reward is Lipschitz continuous in expected base arm outcomes. For this setup, we propose an algorithm called Optimistic Combinatorial Learning and Optimization with Kernel Upper Confidence Bounds (O'CLOK-UCB) and prove that it incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\lambda^*(K)KT\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)} )$ regret with high probability, where $\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)$ is the maximum information gain associated with the sets of base arm contexts $\mathcal{X}_t$ that appeared in the first $T$ rounds, $K$ is the maximum cardinality of any feasible action over all rounds, and $\lambda^*(K)$ is the maximum eigenvalue of all covariance matrices of selected actions up to time $T$, which is a function of $K$. To dramatically speed up the algorithm, we also propose a variant of O'CLOK-UCB that uses sparse GPs. Finally, we experimentally show that both algorithms exploit inter-base arm outcome correlation and vastly outperform the previous state-of-the-art UCB-based algorithms in realistic setups.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment and has been increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, including autonomous driving. Despite its promise, RL is susceptible to attacks designed either to compromise policy learning or to induce erroneous decisions by trained agents. Although the literature on RL security has grown rapidly and several surveys exist, existing categorizations often fall short in guiding the selection of appropriate defenses for specific systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.

<title>Towards the Identifiability in Noisy Label Learning: A Multinomial Mixture Modelling Approach</title>

Abstract: Learning from noisy labels (LNL) is crucial in deep learning, in which one of the approaches is to identify clean-label samples from poorly-annotated datasets. Such an identification is challenging because the conventional LNL problem, which assumes only one noisy label per instance, is non-identifiable, i.e., clean labels cannot be estimated theoretically without additional heuristics. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach that addresses this issue without requiring any heuristics about clean samples. We discover that the LNL problem becomes identifiable if there are at least $2C - 1$ i.i.d. noisy labels per instance, where $C$ is the number of classes. Our finding relies on the assumption of i.i.d. noisy labels and multinomial mixture modelling, making it easier to interpret than previous studies that require full-rank noisy-label transition matrices. To fulfil this condition without additional manual annotations, we propose a method that automatically generates additional i.i.d. noisy labels through nearest neighbours. These noisy labels are then used in the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to infer clean labels. Our method demonstrably estimates clean labels accurately across various label noise benchmarks, including synthetic, web-controlled, and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the model trained with our method performs competitively with many state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: To raise awareness of the environmental impact of deep learning (DL), many studies estimate the energy use of DL systems. However, energy estimates during DL training often rely on unverified assumptions. This work addresses that gap by investigating how model architecture and training environment affect energy consumption. We train a variety of computer vision models and collect energy consumption and accuracy metrics to analyze their trade-offs across configurations. Our results show that selecting the right model-training environment combination can reduce training energy consumption by up to 80.68% with less than 2% loss in $F_1$ score. We find a significant interaction effect between model and training environment: energy efficiency improves when GPU computational power scales with model complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that common estimation practices, such as using FLOPs or GPU TDP, fail to capture these dynamics and can lead to substantial errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Stable Training Epoch Projection (STEP) and the Pre-training Regression-based Estimation (PRE) methods. Across evaluations, our methods outperform existing tools by a factor of two or more in estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Sampling from Boltzmann distributions, particularly those tied to high dimensional and complex energy functions, poses a significant challenge in many fields. In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator (EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and diffusion models. EDG uses a decoder to generate Boltzmann-distributed samples from simple latent variables, and a diffusion-based encoder to estimate the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution. Notably, EDG is simulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints such as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG across a variety of sampling tasks with complex target distributions, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We show that several major algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) fit into the framework of categorical cybernetics, that is to say, parametrised bidirectional processes. We build on our previous work in which we show that value iteration can be represented by precomposition with a certain optic. The outline of the main construction in this paper is: (1) We extend the Bellman operators to parametrised optics that apply to action-value functions and depend on a sample. (2) We apply a representable contravariant functor, obtaining a parametrised function that applies the Bellman iteration. (3) This parametrised function becomes the backward pass of another parametrised optic that represents the model, which interacts with an environment via an agent. Thus, parametrised optics appear in two different ways in our construction, with one becoming part of the other. As we show, many of the major classes of algorithms in RL can be seen as different extremal cases of this general setup: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, and deep RL. We see this as strong evidence that this approach is a natural one and believe that it will be a fruitful way to think about RL in the future.

Abstract: This paper introduces Least Volume (LV)--a simple yet effective regularization method inspired by geometric intuition--that reduces the number of latent dimensions required by an autoencoder without prior knowledge of the dataset's intrinsic dimensionality. We show that its effectiveness depends on the Lipschitz continuity of the decoder, prove that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear special case, and demonstrate that LV induces a PCA-like importance ordering in nonlinear models. We extend LV to non-Euclidean settings as Generalized Least Volume (GLV), enabling the integration of label information into the latent representation. To support implementation, we also develop an accompanying Dynamic Pruning algorithm. We evaluate LV on several benchmark problems, demonstrating its effectiveness in dimension reduction. Leveraging this, we reveal the role of low-dimensional latent spaces in data sampling and disentangled representation, and use them to probe the varying topological complexity of various datasets. GLV is further applied to labeled datasets, where it induces a contrastive learning effect in representations of discrete labels. On a continuous-label airfoil dataset, it produces representations that lead to smooth changes in aerodynamic performance, thereby stabilizing downstream optimization.

Abstract: Desirable random graph models (RGMs) should (i) reproduce common patterns in real-world graphs (e.g., power-law degrees, small diameters, and high clustering), (ii) generate variable (i.e., not overly similar) graphs, and (iii) remain tractable to compute and control graph statistics. A common class of RGMs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi and stochastic Kronecker) outputs edge probabilities, so we need to realize (i.e., sample from) the output edge probabilities to generate graphs. Typically, the existence of each edge is assumed to be determined independently, for simplicity and tractability. However, with edge independency, RGMs provably cannot produce high subgraph densities and high output variability simultaneously. In this work, we explore RGMs beyond edge independence that can better reproduce common patterns while maintaining high tractability and variability. Theoretically, we propose an edge-dependent realization (i.e., sampling) framework called binding that provably preserves output variability, and derive closed-form tractability results on subgraph (e.g., triangle) densities. Practically, we propose algorithms for graph generation with binding and parameter fitting of binding. Our empirical results demonstrate that RGMs with binding exhibit high tractability and well reproduce common patterns, significantly improving upon edge-independent RGMs.

Abstract: Adaptive inference schemes reduce the cost of machine learning inference by assigning smaller models to easier examples, attempting to avoid invocation of larger models when possible. In this work we explore a simple, effective adaptive inference technique we term Agreement-Based Cascading (ABC). ABC builds a cascade of models of increasing size/complexity, and uses agreement between ensembles of models at each level of the cascade as a basis for data-dependent routing. Although ensemble execution introduces additional expense, we show that these costs can be easily offset in practice due to large expected differences in model sizes, parallel inference execution capabilities, and accuracy benefits of ensembling. We examine ABC theoretically and empirically in terms of these parameters, showing that the approach can reliably act as a drop-in replacement for existing models and surpass the best single model it aims to replace in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we explore the performance of ABC relative to existing cascading methods in three common scenarios: (1) edge-to-cloud inference, where ABC reduces communication costs by up to 14x; (2) cloud-based model serving, where it achieves a 3x reduction in rental costs; and (3) inference via model API services, where ABC achieves a 2-25x reduction in average price per token/request relative to state-of-the-art LLM cascades.

Abstract: Scientific discovery catalyzes human intellectual advances, driven by the cycle of hypothesis generation, experimental design, evaluation, and assumption refinement. Central to this process is causal inference, uncovering the mechanisms behind observed phenomena. While randomized experiments provide strong inferences, they are often infeasible due to ethical or practical constraints. However, observational studies are prone to confounding or mediating biases. While crucial, identifying such backdoor paths is expensive and heavily depends on scientists' domain knowledge to generate hypotheses. We introduce a novel benchmark where the objective is to complete a partial causal graph. We design a benchmark with varying difficulty levels with over 4000 queries. We show the strong ability of LLMs to hypothesize the backdoor variables between a cause and its effect. Unlike simple knowledge memorization of fixed associations, our task requires the LLM to reason according to the context of the entire graph.

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous real-world applications. Being an unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD without label supervision. Despite a long list of available OD algorithms with tunable hyperparameters, the lack of systematic approaches for unsupervised algorithm and hyperparameter selection limits their effective use in practice. In this paper, we present FoMo-0D, a pre-trained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which bypasses the hurdle of model selection altogether. Having been pre-trained on synthetic data, FoMo-0D can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of test samples without parameter fine-tuning -- requiring no labeled data, and no additional training or hyperparameter tuning when given a new task. Extensive experiments on 57 real-world datasets against 26 baselines show that FoMo-0D is highly competitive; outperforming the majority of the baselines with no statistically significant difference from the 2nd best method. Further, FoMo-0D is efficient in inference time requiring only 7.7 ms per sample on average, with at least 7x speed-up compared to previous methods. To facilitate future research, our implementations for data synthesis and pre-training as well as model checkpoints are openly available at https://github.com/A-Chicharito-S/FoMo-0D.

<title>Expressiveness of Multi-Neuron Convex Relaxations in Neural Network Certification</title>

Abstract: Neural network certification methods heavily rely on convex relaxations to provide robustness guarantees. However, these relaxations are often imprecise: even the most accurate single-neuron relaxation is incomplete for general ReLU networks, a limitation known as the \emph{single-neuron convex barrier}. While multi-neuron relaxations have been heuristically applied to address this issue, two central questions arise: (i) whether they overcome the convex barrier, and if not, (ii) whether they offer theoretical capabilities beyond those of single-neuron relaxations. In this work, we present the first rigorous analysis of the expressiveness of multi-neuron relaxations. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that they are inherently incomplete, even when allocated sufficient resources to capture finitely many neurons and layers optimally. This result extends the single-neuron barrier to a \textit{universal convex barrier} for neural network certification. On the positive side, we show that completeness can be achieved by either (i) augmenting the network with a polynomial number of carefully designed ReLU neurons or (ii) partitioning the input domain into convex sub-polytopes, thereby distinguishing multi-neuron relaxations from single-neuron ones which are unable to realize the former and have worse partition complexity for the latter. Our findings establish a foundation for multi-neuron relaxations and point to new directions for certified robustness, including training methods tailored to multi-neuron relaxations and verification methods with multi-neuron relaxations as the main subroutine.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce social biases, yet prevailing evaluations score models in isolation, obscuring how biases persist across families and releases. We introduce Bias Similarity Measurement (BSM), which treats fairness as a relational property between models, unifying scalar, distributional, behavioral, and representational signals into a single similarity space. Evaluating 30 LLMs on 1M+ prompts, we find that instruction tuning primarily enforces abstention rather than altering internal representations; small models gain little accuracy and can become less fair under forced choice; and open-weight models can match or exceed proprietary systems. Family signatures diverge: Gemma favors refusal, LLaMA 3.1 approaches neutrality with fewer refusals, and converges toward abstention-heavy behavior overall. Counterintuitively, Gemma 3 Instruct matches GPT-4-level fairness at far lower cost, whereas Gemini's heavy abstention suppresses utility. Beyond these findings, BSM offers an auditing workflow for procurement, regression testing, and lineage screening, and extends naturally to code and multilingual settings. Our results reframe fairness not as isolated scores but as comparative bias similarity, enabling systematic auditing of LLM ecosystems. Code available at https://github.com/HyejunJeong/bias_llm.

Abstract: Traditional theories of optimization cannot describe the dynamics of optimization in deep learning, even in the simple setting of deterministic training. The challenge is that optimizers typically operate in a complex, oscillatory regime called the "edge of stability." In this paper, we develop theory that can describe the dynamics of optimization in this regime. Our key insight is that while the *exact* trajectory of an oscillatory optimizer may be challenging to analyze, the *time-averaged* (i.e. smoothed) trajectory is often much more tractable. To analyze an optimizer, we derive a differential equation called a "central flow" that characterizes this time-averaged trajectory. We empirically show that these central flows can predict long-term optimization trajectories for generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these central flows, we are able to understand how gradient descent makes progress even as the loss sometimes goes up; how adaptive optimizers "adapt" to the local loss landscape; and how adaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards regions where they can take larger steps. Our results suggest that central flows can be a valuable theoretical tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.

Abstract: Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations. An ablation study highlights the critical role of monotonicity in enhancing performance.

Abstract: We propose the first method to show theoretical limitations for one-layer softmax transformers with arbitrarily many precision bits (even infinite). We establish those limitations for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match 3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all possible token triplets in an input sequence. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: function composition (Peng et al., 2024) and binary relations composition, respectively. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that, equipped with this mechanism, a one-layer transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. Importantly, we show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023), and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.

Abstract: Human language encompasses a wide range of intricate and diverse implicit features, which attackers can exploit to launch adversarial or backdoor attacks, compromising DNN models for NLP tasks. Existing model-oriented defenses often require substantial computational resources as model size increases, whereas sample-oriented defenses typically focus on specific attack vectors or schemes, rendering them vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We observe that the root cause of both adversarial and backdoor attacks lies in the encoding process of DNN models, where subtle textual features, negligible for human comprehension, are erroneously assigned significant weight by less robust or trojaned models. Based on it we propose a unified and adaptive defense framework that is effective against both adversarial and backdoor attacks. Our approach leverages reformulation modules to address potential malicious features in textual inputs while preserving the original semantic integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing sample-oriented defense baselines across a diverse range of malicious textual features.

Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain of the network into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which a network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define an equivalence class $\sim_\Phi$ on top of an input dataset, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the \textit{overlap decomposition} $\mathcal{O}_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and an input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to quotient homology groups $H_k(\Phi(\mathcal{M})) \simeq H_k(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{O}_\Phi)$. This lets us intrinsically calculate the Betti numbers of neural representations without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our overlap homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on several classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.

Abstract: Multi-source transfer learning provides an effective solution to data scarcity in real- world supervised learning scenarios by leveraging multiple source tasks. In this field, existing works typically use all available samples from sources in training, which constrains their training efficiency and may lead to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that answers the question: what is the optimal quantity of source samples needed from each source task to jointly train the target model? Specifically, we introduce a generalization error measure based on K-L divergence, and minimize it based on high-dimensional statistical analysis to determine the optimal transfer quantity for each source task. Additionally, we develop an architecture-agnostic and data-efficient algorithm OTQMS to implement our theoretical results for target model training in multi- source transfer learning. Experimental studies on diverse architectures and two real-world benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and data efficiency.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that structured machine learning models such as tree ensembles are vulnerable to privacy attacks targeting their training data. To mitigate these risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted countermeasure, as it offers rigorous privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce a reconstruction attack targeting state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-DP random forests. By leveraging a constraint programming model that incorporates knowledge of the forest's structure and DP mechanism characteristics, our approach formally reconstructs the most likely dataset that could have produced a given forest. Through extensive computational experiments, we examine the interplay between model utility, privacy guarantees and reconstruction accuracy across various configurations. Our results reveal that random forests trained with meaningful DP guarantees can still leak portions of their training data. Specifically, while DP reduces the success of reconstruction attacks, the only forests fully robust to our attack exhibit predictive performance no better than a constant classifier. Building on these insights, we also provide practical recommendations for the construction of DP random forests that are more resilient to reconstruction attacks while maintaining a non-trivial predictive performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.

Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-bootstrap perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-bootstrap process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4\% under global long-tailed settings.

Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. However, while this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient~optimization.

Abstract: Accurate crop-type classification from satellite time series is essential for agricultural monitoring. While various machine learning algorithms have been developed to enhance performance on data-scarce tasks, their evaluation often lacks real-world scenarios. Consequently, their efficacy in challenging practical applications has not yet been profoundly assessed. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating supervised and SSL methods for crop-type classification under real-world conditions. This benchmark study relies on the EuroCropsML time-series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to supervised transfer learning and SSL methods. However, compared to simpler transfer learning, the improvement of meta-learning comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, supervised methods benefit most when pre-trained and fine-tuned on geographically close regions. In addition, while SSL generally lags behind meta-learning, it demonstrates advantages over training from scratch, particularly in capturing fine-grained features essential for real-world crop-type classification, and also surpasses standard transfer learning. This highlights its practical value when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce. Our insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational demand in selecting supervised machine learning methods for real-world crop-type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of knowledge transfer across diverse geographic regions. Furthermore, they demonstrate the practical value of SSL approaches when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce.

Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models are released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit. In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave among the functionalities of language models.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have made great progress in the field of text-to-speech (TTS), but they still face major challenges in synthesizing fine-grained emotional speech in an interpretable manner. Traditional methods rely on discrete emotion labels to control emotion categories and intensities, which cannot capture the complexity and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and fine-grained emotional annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose UDDETTS, a universal LLM framework unifying discrete and dimensional emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech datasets with different types of emotional annotations to train the UDDETTS. Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along three interpretable dimensions, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech synthesis capabilities. Code and demos are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/UDDETTS.

Abstract: While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework introducing two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions, equipping the method with a fallback mechanism guaranteeing a performance lower bound even on non-fractal graphs. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61\%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional and latest baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 4\%. Codes are available at (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FractalGCL-0511/).

Abstract: Time series forecasting faces two important but often overlooked challenges. Firstly, the inherent random noise in the time series labels sets a theoretical lower bound for the forecasting error, which is positively correlated with the entropy of the labels. Secondly, neural networks exhibit a frequency bias when modeling the state-space of time series, that is, the model performs well in learning certain frequency bands but poorly in others, thus restricting the overall forecasting performance. To address the first challenge, we prove a theorem that there exists a unitary transformation that can reduce the marginal entropy of multiple correlated Gaussian processes, thereby providing guidance for reducing the lower bound of forecasting error. Furthermore, experiments confirm that Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can reduce the entropy in the majority of scenarios. Correspondingly, to alleviate the frequency bias, we jointly introduce supervision in the frequency domain along the temporal dimension through DFT and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). This supervision-side strategy is highly general and can be seamlessly integrated into any supervised learning method. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function named OLMA, which utilizes the frequency domain transformation across both channel and temporal dimensions to enhance forecasting. Finally, the experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OLMA in addressing the above two challenges and the resulting improvement in forecasting accuracy. The results also indicate that the perspectives of entropy and frequency bias provide a new and feasible research direction for time series forecasting. The code is available at: https://github.com/Yuyun1011/OLMA-One-Loss-for-More-Accurate-Time-Series-Forecasting.

Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although many advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3\dots$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks researchers' view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on the Schr\"odingerisation method in quantum simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution mechanism in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement a Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, the $d+1$ dimensional evolving designs in our SKNO consistently outperform other baselines across ten benchmarks of increasing difficulty, ranging from the simple 1D heat equation to the highly nonlinear 3D Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We also validate the resolution-invariance of SKNO on mixing-resolution training and zero-shot super-resolution tasks. In addition, we show the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is essential for long-term decision-making, particularly when the environment may differ from its specification. However, a significant gap exists in understanding the finite-sample complexity of these methods, as most existing work provides only asymptotic guarantees. This limitation hinders their principled understanding and practical deployment, especially in data-limited scenarios. We close this gap by proposing \textbf{Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI)}, a new algorithm designed for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with transition uncertainty characterized by $\ell_p$-norm and contamination models. Our approach offers three key advantages over previous methods: (1). Weaker Structural Assumptions: RHI only requires the underlying robust MDP to be communicating, a less restrictive condition than the commonly assumed ergodicity or irreducibility; (2). No Prior Knowledge: Our algorithm operates without requiring any prior knowledge of the robust MDP; (3). State-of-the-Art Sample Complexity: To learn an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy, RHI achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias span. This result represents the tightest known bound. Our work hence provides essential theoretical understanding of sample efficiency of robust average reward RL.

Abstract: Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of quantisation formats is large and formats are often chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using variable-length codes. We frame the problem as minimising the KL divergence between original and quantised model outputs under a model size constraint, which can be approximated by minimising the squared quantisation error, a well-studied problem where entropy-constrained quantisers with variable-length codes are optimal. We develop non-linear quantisation curves for block-scaled data across multiple distribution families and observe that these formats, along with sparse outlier formats, consistently outperform fixed-length formats, indicating that they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when applied to large language models.

Abstract: Traditional saliency map methods, popularized in computer vision, highlight individual points (pixels) of the input that contribute the most to the model's output. However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain, enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction, electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide semantically meaningful insights in time-series models that are impossible with traditional time-domain saliency.

Abstract: Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast>1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions. However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored. We introduce Cohort-based Active Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark acquisition strategies. Experiments on multimodal datasets with up to 15 modalities demonstrate that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the acquisition of additional modalities for selected samples compared with methods relying solely on unimodal information, entropy-based guidance, or random selection. We showcase the real-world relevance and scalability of our method by demonstrating its ability to effectively guide the costly acquisition of proteomics data for disease prediction in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank (UKBB). Our work provides an effective approach for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level, enabling more effective use of resources in constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and to be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided but a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments and using the latter as explicit supervisory signals. To assess effectiveness, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate their performance on downstream tasks. The evaluation includes both node-level tasks, such as gene function classification, and graph-level tasks on patient-specific GRNs, such as patient survival hazard prediction. Across 13 tasks built from GRN datasets derived from patients with three cancer types, SupGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

Abstract: Open-weight large language model (LLM) zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of $2\times$ cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

<title>Bridging Arbitrary and Tree Metrics via Differentiable Gromov Hyperbolicity</title>

Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data. Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.

Abstract: Competing risks are crucial considerations in survival modelling, particularly in healthcare domains where patients may experience multiple distinct event types. We propose CRISP-NAM (Competing Risks Interpretable Survival Prediction with Neural Additive Models), an interpretable neural additive model for competing risks survival analysis which extends the neural additive architecture to model cause-specific hazards while preserving feature-level interpretability. Each feature contributes independently to risk estimation through dedicated neural networks, allowing for visualization of complex non-linear relationships between covariates and each competing risk. We demonstrate competitive performance on multiple datasets compared to existing approaches.

<title>On the Dynamic Regret of Following the Regularized Leader: Optimism with History Pruning</title>

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However, building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not the "lazy" projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates, allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two when necessary.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.

Abstract: Transformers excel across a large variety of tasks but remain susceptible to corrupted inputs, since standard self-attention treats all query-key interactions uniformly. Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii) comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning.
  We are interested in the so-called ``robust'' setting, where the convergence guarantee does not depend on the minimal curvature of the potential function.
  While prior work has established convergence guarantees in this setting, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is projected onto a bounded set, a condition that is both artificial and does not match the current practice.
  In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such an assumption and present a refined analysis of TD learning. For the first time, we show that the simple projection-free variant converges with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computing resources, weight pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve SNNs' efficiency. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot post-training pruning/quantization framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based loss found in OBC with a spike train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to prune or quantize synapses and analytically rescale the rest. Our experiments on models trained with neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) and large static datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet) show state-of-the-art results for one-shot post-training compression methods on SNNs, with single-digit to double-digit accuracy gains compared to OBC. SBC also approaches the accuracy of costly iterative methods, while cutting compression time by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements, or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data, (ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization for unconditional and conditional generative models. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. On standard image benchmarks, our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery. We demonstrate our algorithms with datasets of increasing complexity (MNIST, CelebA and ImageNet-1K) and for generative models of increasing complexity (VAEs and diffusion transformers).

<title>There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept. This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the training loss. As a result, MCBMs yield more interpretable representations, support principled concept-level interventions, and remain consistent with probability-theoretic foundations.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy. Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both: during pre-training, a gradient-surgery projection balances the exploration and diversity gradients, and during fine-tuning, a skill selector exploits the learned diversity by choosing skills suited to downstream tasks. Our approach achieves performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. Through an extensive ablation study, we identify the role of each component and demonstrate that each element in AMPED is contributing to performance. We further provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, with a greedy skill selector, greater skill diversity reduces fine-tuning sample complexity. These results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and generalizable skill learning.

<title>Improved Scaling Laws in Linear Regression via Data Reuse</title>

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase. However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$, where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting, one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse (i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity and supports diverse applications in neuroscience. While EEG foundation models (EFMs) have emerged to address the scalability issues of task-specific models, current approaches still yield clinically uninterpretable and weakly discriminative representations, inefficiently capture global dependencies, and neglect important local neural events. We present CodeBrain, a two-stage EFM designed to fill this gap. In the first stage, we introduce the TFDual-Tokenizer, which decouples heterogeneous temporal and frequency EEG signals into discrete tokens, quadratically expanding the representation space to enhance discriminative power and offering domain-specific interpretability by suggesting potential links to neural events and spectral rhythms. In the second stage, we propose the multi-scale EEGSSM architecture, which combines structured global convolution with sliding window attention to efficiently capture both sparse long-range and local dependencies, reflecting the brain's small-world topology. Pretrained on the largest public EEG corpus, CodeBrain achieves strong generalization across 8 downstream tasks and 10 datasets under distribution shifts, supported by comprehensive ablations, scaling-law analyses, and interpretability evaluations. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in the future version.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data-stemming from the onerous and costly nature of experimental validation-further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the model to learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate significant performance gains on challenging real-world datasets with substantial covariate shift, supported by t-SNE visualizations highlighting our interpolation method.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL) that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior. Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases, results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation, which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied five machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. Overall, our findings show that Random Forest with A2 copula oversampling (theta = 10) achieved the best performance, with improvements of 5.3% in accuracy, 9.5% in precision, 5.7% in recall, 7.6% in F1-score, and 1.1% in AUC compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we statistically validated our results using the McNemar's test. This research represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to very successful, but by no means humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability and the exact convex polytope representations. We show that it results in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and cheaply-computable confidence/reliability measures for both the model inputs and the outputs. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a broad set of synthetic and real-world problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of important La Ni\~na and El Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training - a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction tools.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and necessitate a middleware layer that adapts FL to distributional shifts. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition-prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called Co-Learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED produces curricula that improve zero-shot generalization over strong baselines across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the transition-prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that Co-Learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition-prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained MDP. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based RCMDP setting. In addition to the RCMDP setting, the paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

<title>Blending Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Prefix Sampling</title>

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.

<title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Naturally Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

<title>Training-Free Stein Diffusion Guidance: Posterior Correction for Sampling Beyond High-Density Regions</title>

Abstract: Training free diffusion guidance provides a flexible way to leverage off-the-shelf classifiers without additional training. Yet, current approaches hinge on posterior approximations via Tweedie's formula, which often yield unreliable guidance, particularly in low-density regions. Stochastic optimal control (SOC), in contrast, provides principled posterior simulation but is prohibitively expensive for fast sampling. In this work, we reconcile the strengths of these paradigms by introducing Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a novel training-free framework grounded in a surrogate SOC objective. We establish a theoretical bound on the value function, demonstrating the necessity of correcting approximate posteriors to faithfully reflect true diffusion dynamics. Leveraging Stein variational inference, SDG identifies the steepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between approximate and true posteriors. By incorporating a principled Stein correction mechanism and a novel running cost functional, SDG enables effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on molecular low-density sampling tasks suggest that SDG consistently surpasses standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential for broader diffusion-based sampling beyond high-density regions.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for black-box optimization, but its application to high-dimensional permutation spaces is severely limited by the challenge of defining scalable representations. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on an exhaustive $\Omega(n^2)$ pairwise comparison, inducing a dense representation that is impractical for large-scale permutations. To break this barrier, we introduce a novel framework for generating efficient permutation representations via kernel functions derived from sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from enumeration sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} , which leverages the divide-and-conquer structure of merge sort to produce a compact, $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity with no information loss and effectively capture permutation structure. Our central thesis is that the Merge Kernel performs competitively with the Mallows kernel in low-dimensional settings, but significantly outperforms it in both optimization performance and computational efficiency as the dimension $n$ grows. Extensive evaluations on various permutation optimization benchmarks confirm our hypothesis, demonstrating that the Merge Kernel provides a scalable and more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional permutation spaces, thereby unlocking the potential for tackling previously intractable problems such as large-scale feature ordering and combinatorial neural architecture search.

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The implementation is readily available at: \href{https://github.com/itay1551/ParallelTime}{GitHub}.

Abstract: We propose the State Space Neural Operator (SS-NO), a compact architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Our formulation extends structured state space models (SSMs) to joint spatiotemporal modeling, introducing two key mechanisms: adaptive damping, which stabilizes learning by localizing receptive fields, and learnable frequency modulation, which enables data-driven spectral selection. These components provide a unified framework for capturing long-range dependencies with parameter efficiency. Theoretically, we establish connections between SSMs and neural operators, proving a universality theorem for convolutional architectures with full field-of-view. Empirically, SS-NO achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks-including 1D Burgers' and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows-while using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches. A factorized variant of SS-NO further demonstrates scalable performance on challenging 2D problems. Our results highlight the effectiveness of damping and frequency learning in operator modeling, while showing that lightweight factorization provides a complementary path toward efficient large-scale PDE learning.

<title>GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance</title>

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables stable sample reuse over multiple epochs by employing a policy gradient clipping mechanism tailored for RPG. It is further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and remains fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and strong performance.

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like Llama-3.1-8B.

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time causal model as the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite the presence of latent subprocesses.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This training-free method, termed Running Confidence Remasking (RCR), consistently enhances performance and provides further improvements when used with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer $\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization skills and reasoning skills. By training MoE families that vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing under fixed compute budgets, we disentangle pre-training loss from downstream accuracy. Our results reveal two principles. First, Active FLOPs: models with identical training loss but greater active compute achieve higher reasoning accuracy. Second, Total tokens per parameter (TPP): memorization tasks improve with more parameters, while reasoning tasks benefit from optimal TPP, indicating that reasoning is data-hungry. Neither reinforcement learning post-training (GRPO) nor increased test-time compute alters these trends. We therefore argue that optimal MoE sparsity must be determined jointly by active FLOPs and TPP, revising the classical picture of compute-optimal scaling. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long-horizon rollout of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories. Finally, with only 10 solver steps' worth of augmented stencil data, our approach outperforms traditional ML emulators trained on thousands of trajectories in long-horizon rollout accuracy and stability.

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness. Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for achieving these gains.

<title>On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms</title>

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

<title>Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs. Neural Operators</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing accurate, data-efficient surrogate models is central to advancing AI for Science. Neural operators (NOs), which approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using conventional neural architectures, have gained popularity as surrogates for systems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their reliance on large datasets and limited ability to generalize in low-data regimes hinder their practical utility. We argue that these limitations arise from their global processing of data, which fails to exploit the local, discretized structure of physical systems. To address this, we propose Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) as a principled surrogate modeling paradigm for time-dependent PDEs. GNS leverages message-passing combined with numerical time-stepping schemes to learn PDE dynamics by modeling the instantaneous time derivatives. This design mimics traditional numerical solvers, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts and strong inductive biases that enhance generalization. We rigorously evaluate GNS on four canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D scalar Burgers', (2) 2D coupled Burgers', (3) 2D Allen-Cahn, and (4) 2D nonlinear shallow-water equations, comparing against state-of-the-art NOs including Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Results demonstrate that GNS is markedly more data-efficient, achieving less than 1% relative L2 error using only 3% of available trajectories, and exhibits dramatically reduced error accumulation over time (82.5% lower autoregressive error than FNO, 99.9% lower than DeepONet). To choose the training data, we introduce a PCA combined with KMeans trajectory selection strategy. These findings provide compelling evidence that GNS, with its graph-based locality and solver-inspired design, is the most suitable and scalable surrogate modeling framework for AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network reasoning and generalization; models must decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment), a simple encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction ($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit and probing experiments, we reveal how ALICE progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common human strategies -- early layers place greater emphasis on letter frequencies, while later layers form word-level structures. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods are applicable beyond cryptograms and offer new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task decision-making, tasks not only exhibit diverse observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in their underlying complexities. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling a broad and diverse suite of tasks, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two complementary perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, to mitigate the gradient conflicts, we systematically investigate key architectural designs for extending UniZero. Our investigation identifies a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture as the most effective approach. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that this architecture alleviates gradient conflicts by routing task-specific representations to specialized sub-networks. This finding leads to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically allocate model capacity throughout the learning process, we introduce an online Dynamic Parameter Scaling (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Evaluations on a diverse set of standard benchmarks (Atari, DMC, Jericho) demonstrate that ScaleZero, utilizing solely online reinforcement learning with one model, performs on par with specialized single-task agents. With the DPS strategy, it remains competitive while using just 71.5% of the environment interactions. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective multi-task planning.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. For LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 37.3 for QuIP. \href{https://github.com/42Shawn/Butterflyquant-llm}{Codes} are available.

Abstract: The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations, the overall effect size across the entire population is small. Then, the focus naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning framework tailored to matched-pair designs. Our design not only reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions. Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity and experiments in practical scenarios demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the approach.

Abstract: Large language models frequently generate confident but incorrect outputs, requiring formal uncertainty quantification with abstention guarantees. We develop information-lift certificates that compare model probabilities to a skeleton baseline, accumulating evidence into sub-gamma PAC-Bayes bounds valid under heavy-tailed distributions. Across eight datasets, our method achieves 77.2\% coverage at 2\% risk, outperforming recent 2023-2024 baselines by 8.6-15.1 percentage points, while blocking 96\% of critical errors in high-stakes scenarios vs 18-31\% for entropy methods. Limitations include skeleton dependence and frequency-only (not severity-aware) risk control, though performance degrades gracefully under corruption.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML) pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

Abstract: Domestic violence is commonly viewed as a gendered issue that primarily affects women, which tends to leave male victims largely overlooked. This study presents a novel, data-driven analysis of male domestic violence (MDV) in Bangladesh, highlighting the factors that influence it and addressing the challenges posed by a significant categorical imbalance of 5:1 and limited data availability. We collected data from nine major cities in Bangladesh and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying dynamics. EDA revealed patterns such as the high prevalence of verbal abuse, the influence of financial dependency, and the role of familial and socio-economic factors in MDV. To predict and analyze MDV, we implemented 10 traditional machine learning (ML) models, three deep learning models, and two ensemble models, including stacking and hybrid approaches. We propose a stacking ensemble model with ANN and CatBoost as base classifiers and Logistic Regression as the meta-model, which demonstrated the best performance, achieving $95\%$ accuracy, a $99.29\%$ AUC, and balanced metrics across evaluation criteria. Model-specific feature importance analysis of the base classifiers identified key features influencing their decision-making. Model-agnostic explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, provided both local and global insights into the decision-making processes of the proposed model, thereby increasing transparency and interpretability. Statistical validation using paired $t$-tests with 10-fold cross-validation and Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.0036$) confirmed the superior performance of our proposed model over alternatives. Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that domestic abuse primarily affects women, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions and support systems for male victims.

Abstract: Timely detection of problematic research is essential for safeguarding scientific integrity. To explore whether social media commentary can serve as an early indicator of potentially problematic articles, this study analysed 3,815 tweets referencing 604 retracted articles and 3,373 tweets referencing 668 comparable non-retracted articles. Tweets critical of the articles were identified through both human annotation and large language models (LLMs). Human annotation revealed that 8.3% of retracted articles were associated with at least one critical tweet prior to retraction, compared to only 1.5% of non-retracted articles, highlighting the potential of tweets as early warning signals of retraction. However, critical tweets identified by LLMs (GPT-4o mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) only partially aligned with human annotation, suggesting that fully automated monitoring of post-publication discourse should be applied with caution. A human-AI collaborative approach may offer a more reliable and scalable alternative, with human expertise helping to filter out tweets critical of issues unrelated to the research integrity of the articles. Overall, this study provides insights into how social media signals, combined with generative AI technologies, may support efforts to strengthen research integrity.

Abstract: Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for accelerating the training of scientific machine learning applications. The design of the proposed preconditioner is motivated by the nonlinear two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner. The neural network parameters are decomposed into groups (subdomains) with overlapping regions. In addition, the network's feed-forward structure is indirectly imposed through a novel subdomain-wise synchronization strategy and a coarse-level training step. Through a series of numerical experiments, which consider physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed two-level preconditioner significantly speeds up the convergence of the standard (LBFGS) optimizer while also yielding more accurate machine learning models. Moreover, the devised preconditioner is designed to take advantage of model-parallel computations, which can further reduce the training time.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic systems like disease outbreaks, social influence, and information diffusion requires effective modeling of complex networks. Traditional evaluation methods for static networks often fall short when applied to temporal networks. This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507).

Abstract: We study the problem of restricting a Markov equivalence class of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) to only those MAGs that contain certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert or orientation knowledge. Such a restriction of the Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential ancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation rules for adding orientation knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with orientation knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm for including this orientation knowledge and show that in certain settings the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally, outside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent confounding.

Abstract: Identifying reaction conditions that are broadly applicable across diverse substrates is a longstanding challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical research. While many methods are available to generate conditions with acceptable performance, a universal approach for reliably discovering effective conditions during reaction exploration is rare. Consequently, current reaction optimization processes are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly, relying heavily on trial-and-error experimentation. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry-related problems, such as molecule design and chemical reasoning tasks. Here, we report the design, implementation and application of Chemma-RC, a text-augmented multimodal LLM to identify effective conditions through task-specific dialogue and condition generation. Chemma-RC learns a unified representation of chemical reactions by aligning multiple modalities-including text corpus, reaction SMILES, and reaction graphs-within a shared embedding module. Performance benchmarking on datasets showed high precision in identifying optimal conditions, with up to 17% improvement over the current state-of-the-art methods. A palladium-catalysed imidazole C-H arylation reaction was investigated experimentally to evaluate the functionalities of the Chemma-RC in practice. Our findings suggest that Chemma-RC holds significant potential to accelerate high-throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce a real-time identification method for discrete-time state-dependent switching systems in both the input--output and state-space domains. In particular, we design a system of adaptive algorithms running in two timescales; a stochastic approximation algorithm implements an online deterministic annealing scheme at a slow timescale and estimates the mode-switching signal, and an recursive identification algorithm runs at a faster timescale and updates the parameters of the local models based on the estimate of the switching signal. We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we address specific challenges that arise in the application of the proposed methodology in identification of more general switching systems. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) extends recognition beyond fixed taxonomies by aligning visual and textual features, as in MDETR, GLIP, or RegionCLIP. While effective, these models require updating all parameters of large vision--language backbones, leading to prohibitive training cost. Recent efficient OVD approaches, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or adapters, reduce trainable parameters but often face challenges in selecting which layers to adapt and in balancing efficiency with accuracy. We propose UniProj-Det, a lightweight modular framework for parameter-efficient OVD. UniProj-Det freezes pretrained backbones and introduces a Universal Projection module with a learnable modality token, enabling unified vision--language adaptation at minimal cost. Applied to MDETR, our framework trains only about ~2-5% of parameters while achieving competitive or superior performance on phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and segmentation. Comprehensive analysis of FLOPs, memory, latency, and ablations demonstrates UniProj-Det as a principled step toward scalable and efficient open-vocabulary detection.

Abstract: The discovery of magnetic materials with high operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are limited by the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 67,573 magnetic materials entries(www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, we trained machine learning models to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 (0.83) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 56K (38K). These models identified 25 (13) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models to accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.

Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.

<title>Scaling Laws for Online Advertisement Retrieval</title>

Abstract: The scaling law is a notable property of neural network models and has significantly propelled the development of large language models. Scaling laws hold great promise in guiding model design and resource allocation. Recent research increasingly shows that scaling laws are not limited to NLP tasks or Transformer architectures; they also apply to domains such as recommendation. However, there is still a lack of literature on scaling law research in online advertisement retrieval systems. This may be because 1) identifying the scaling law for resource cost and online revenue is often expensive in both time and training resources for industrial applications, and 2) varying settings for different systems prevent the scaling law from being applied across various scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight paradigm to identify online scaling laws of retrieval models, incorporating a novel offline metric and an offline simulation algorithm. We prove that under mild assumptions, the correlation between the novel metric and online revenue asymptotically approaches 1 and empirically validates its effectiveness. The simulation algorithm can estimate the machine cost offline. Based on the lightweight paradigm, we can identify online scaling laws for retrieval models almost exclusively through offline experiments, and quickly estimate machine costs and revenues for given model configurations. We further validate the existence of scaling laws across mainstream model architectures (e.g., Transformer, MLP, and DSSM) in our real-world advertising system. With the identified scaling laws, we demonstrate practical applications for ROI-constrained model designing and multi-scenario resource allocation in the online advertising system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study identification and application of online scaling laws for online advertisement retrieval.

arXiv:2412.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its theoretical properties are still not well understood. As with classic neural networks, a common approach to improve these models is to increase their size and depth. However, such strategies may be suboptimal, as several works have shown that adding more layers yields increasingly diminishing returns. More importantly, prior studies have shown that increasing depth may lead to model collapse, i.e., all the tokens converge to a single cluster, undermining the ability of LLMs to generate diverse outputs. Building on differential equation models for the transformer dynamics, we prove that all the tokens in a transformer asymptotically converge to a cluster as depth increases. At the technical level we leverage tools from control theory, including consensus dynamics on manifolds and input-to-state stability (ISS). We then extend our analysis to autoregressive models, exploiting their structure to further generalize the theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Multiple agents are increasingly combined to make decisions with the expectation of achieving complementary performance, where the decisions they make together outperform those made individually. However, knowing how to improve the performance of collaborating agents requires knowing what information and strategies each agent employs. With a focus on human-AI pairings, we contribute a decision-theoretic framework for characterizing the value of information. By defining complementary information, our approach identifies opportunities for agents to better exploit available information in AI-assisted decision workflows. We present a novel explanation technique (ILIV-SHAP) that adapts SHAP explanations to highlight human-complementing information. We validate the effectiveness of ACIV and ILIV-SHAP through a study of human-AI decision-making, and demonstrate the framework on examples from chest X-ray diagnosis and deepfake detection. We find that presenting ILIV-SHAP with AI predictions leads to reliably greater reductions in error over non-AI assisted decisions more than vanilla SHAP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may have an important role to play in mental health by facilitating the quantification of verbal expressions used to communicate emotions, feelings and thoughts. While there has been substantial and very promising work in this area, the fundamental limits are uncertain. Here, focusing on depressive symptoms, we outline and evaluate LLM performance on three critical tests. The first test evaluates LLM performance on a novel ground-truth dataset from a large human sample (n=770). This dataset is novel as it contains both standard clinically validated quantifications of depression symptoms and specific verbal descriptions of the thoughts related to each symptom by the same individual. The performance of LLMs on this richly informative data shows an upper bound on the performance in this domain, and allow us to examine the extent to which inference about symptoms generalises. Second, we test to what extent the latent structure in LLMs can capture the clinically observed patterns. We train supervised sparse auto-encoders (sSAE) to predict specific symptoms and symptom patterns within a syndrome. We find that sSAE weights can effectively modify the clinical pattern produced by the model, and thereby capture the latent structure of relevant clinical variation. Third, if LLMs correctly capture and quantify relevant mental states, then these states should respond to changes in emotional states induced by validated emotion induction interventions. We show that this holds in a third experiment with 190 participants. Overall, this work provides foundational insights into the quantification of pathological mental states with LLMs, highlighting hard limits on the requirements of the data underlying LLM-based quantification; but also suggesting LLMs show substantial conceptual alignment.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Dealing with this trade-off is still an open challenge in designing AI systems for creativity. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We show that our score can be used as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments considering a variety of creative tasks, such as poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.

Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations, reducing late-stage clinical failures, and accelerating the development of precision therapies. Current AI models rely on structural or target-based features but fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically relevant predictions. Here, we introduce Madrigal, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug-combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21,842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. Madrigal uses an attention bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference, a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions, and ablations show both modality alignment and multimodality are necessary. It captures transporter-mediated interactions and aligns with head-to-head clinical trial differences for neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and hypoglycemia. In type 2 diabetes and MASH, Madrigal supports polypharmacy decisions and prioritizes resmetirom among safer candidates. Extending to personalization, Madrigal improves patient-level adverse-event prediction in a longitudinal EHR cohort and an independent oncology cohort, and predicts ex vivo efficacy in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models. Madrigal links preclinical multimodal readouts to safety risks of drug combinations and offers a generalizable foundation for safer combination design.

Abstract: We introduce Paralinguistic Speech Captions (ParaSpeechCaps), a large-scale dataset that annotates speech utterances with rich style captions. While rich abstract tags (e.g. guttural, nasal, pained) have been explored in small-scale human-annotated datasets, existing large-scale datasets only cover basic tags (e.g. low-pitched, slow, loud). We combine off-the-shelf text and speech embedders, classifiers and an audio language model to automatically scale rich tag annotations for the first time. ParaSpeechCaps covers a total of 59 style tags, including both speaker-level intrinsic tags and utterance-level situational tags. It consists of 342 hours of human-labelled data (PSC-Base) and 2427 hours of automatically annotated data (PSC-Scaled). We finetune Parler-TTS, an open-source style-prompted TTS model, on ParaSpeechCaps, and achieve improved style consistency (+7.9% Consistency MOS) and speech quality (+15.5% Naturalness MOS) over the best performing baseline that combines existing rich style tag datasets. We ablate several of our dataset design choices to lay the foundation for future work in this space. Our dataset, models and code are released at https://github.com/ajd12342/paraspeechcaps .

Abstract: Modern machine learning produces models that are impossible for users or developers to fully understand -- raising concerns about trust, oversight, safety, and human dignity when they are integrated into software products. Transparency and explainability methods aim to provide some help in understanding models, but it remains challenging for developers to design explanations that are understandable to target users and effective for their purpose. Emerging guidelines and regulations set goals but may not provide effective actionable guidance to developers. In a large-scale experiment with 124 participants, we explored how developers approach providing end-user explanations, including what challenges they face, and to what extent specific policies can guide their actions. We investigated whether and how specific forms of policy guidance help developers design explanations and provide evidence for policy compliance for an ML-powered screening tool for diabetic retinopathy. Participants across the board struggled to produce quality explanations and comply with the provided policies. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the nature and specificity of policy guidance had little effect. We posit that participant noncompliance is in part due to a failure to imagine and anticipate the needs of non-technical stakeholders. Drawing on cognitive process theory and the sociological imagination to contextualize participants' failure, we recommend educational interventions.

Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models are released at Hugging Face and ModelScope.

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise confidence scores that represent the model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs. We evaluate CONSIGN against two CP baselines across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&amp;D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.

Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nayoung10/MOFFlow-2.

<title>Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion/flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

<title>Bayesian Attention Mechanism: A Probabilistic Framework for Positional Encoding and Context Length Extrapolation</title>

arXiv:2505.22842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length, outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and introducing minimal additional parameters.

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks (TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic multilayer networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

<title>Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models</title>

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by moving illicit funds into the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, detection rates remain low because launderers evade oversight, confirmed cases are rare, and institutions see only fragments of the global transaction network. Since access to real transaction data is tightly restricted, synthetic datasets are essential for developing and evaluating detection methods. However, existing datasets fall short: they often neglect partial observability, temporal dynamics, strategic behavior, uncertain labels, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. We introduce AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. AMLGentex enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering systems under conditions that mirror real-world challenges. By releasing multiple country-specific datasets and practical parameter guidance, we aim to empower researchers and practitioners and provide a common foundation for collaboration and progress in combating money laundering.

arXiv:2507.06795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

arXiv:2507.14119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets (original image, instruction, edited image), yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approx. 2.6x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit, an open dataset of 720k high-quality triplets, curated at industrial scale via millions of guided generations and validator passes, and we analyze the pipeline's stage-wise survival rates, providing a framework for estimating computational effort across different model stacks. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, a fine-tuned Bagel model with state-of-the-art metrics.

<title>GeMix: Conditional GAN-Based Mixup for Improved Medical Image Augmentation</title>

arXiv:2507.15577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification, yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms between Banach spaces of functions. They have become an increasingly critical tool for spatiotemporal forecasting and physics emulation, especially in high-stakes scenarios where robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification is required. We introduce Local Sliced Conformal Inference (LSCI), a distribution-free framework for generating function-valued, locally adaptive prediction sets for operator models. We prove finite-sample validity and derive a data-dependent upper bound on the coverage gap under local exchangeability. On synthetic Gaussian-process tasks and real applications (air quality monitoring, energy demand forecasting, and weather prediction), LSCI yields tighter sets with stronger adaptivity compared to conformal baselines. We also empirically demonstrate robustness against biased predictions and certain out-of-distribution noise regimes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent works have begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, abstract representations of motion between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Vision-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. We demonstrate that villa-X can generate latent action plans in a zero-shot fashion, even for unseen embodiments and open-vocabulary symbolic understanding. This capability enables villa-X to achieve superior performance across diverse simulation tasks in SIMPLER and on two real-world robotic setups involving both gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. These results establish villa-X as a principled and scalable paradigm for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. We believe it provides a strong foundation for future research.

arXiv:2508.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify whether a given output truly originates from the certified model. We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider itself may act adversarially, replacing the certified model with a cheaper or lower-quality substitute. To our knowledge, this is the first work to study fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. Our approach introduces a trusted verifier that, during a certification phase, extracts hidden fingerprints from the authentic model's output space and trains a detector to recognize them. During verification, this detector can determine whether new outputs are consistent with the certified model, without requiring specialized hardware or model modifications. In extensive experiments, our methods achieve near-zero FPR@95%TPR on both GANs and diffusion models, and remain effective even against subtle architectural or training changes. Furthermore, the approach is robust to adaptive adversaries that actively manipulate outputs in an attempt to evade detection.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

arXiv:2508.17892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ and trims the memory footprint to a few tenths of that required for the full context, but also delivers performance comparable to or superior to the full-context setup in long-context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the perspective of improved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces logical constraints on action trajectories in dynamical systems. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the underlying foundation model. We perform comprehensive evaluation of our approach across state-of-the-art navigation foundation models and we show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action-generation.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts. Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge.

Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Text-guided sound separation supports flexible audio editing across media and assistive applications, but existing models like AudioSep are too compute-heavy for edge deployment. Neural audio codec (NAC) models such as CodecFormer and SDCodec are compute-efficient but limited to fixed-class separation. We introduce CodecSep, the first NAC-based model for on-device universal, text-driven separation. CodecSep combines DAC compression with a Transformer masker modulated by CLAP-derived FiLM parameters. Across six open-domain benchmarks under matched training/prompt protocols, \textbf{CodecSep} surpasses \textbf{AudioSep} in separation fidelity (SI-SDR) while remaining competitive in perceptual quality (ViSQOL) and matching or exceeding fixed-stem baselines (TDANet, CodecFormer, SDCodec). In code-stream deployments, it needs just 1.35~GMACs end-to-end -- approximately $54\times$ less compute ($25\times$ architecture-only) than spectrogram-domain separators like AudioSep -- while remaining fully bitstream-compatible.

Abstract: We study whether 3D self-supervised pretraining with Point--JEPA enables label-efficient grasp joint-angle prediction. Meshes are sampled to point clouds and tokenized; a ShapeNet-pretrained Point--JEPA encoder feeds a $K{=}5$ multi-hypothesis head trained with winner-takes-all and evaluated by top--logit selection. On a multi-finger hand dataset with strict object-level splits, Point--JEPA improves top--logit RMSE and Coverage@15$^{\circ}$ in low-label regimes (e.g., 26% lower RMSE at 25% data) and reaches parity at full supervision, suggesting JEPA-style pretraining is a practical lever for data-efficient grasp learning.

<div> Keywords: brain network data, self-supervised learning, SAM-BG, structural semantics, psychiatric diagnoses 

Summary: 
SAM-BG is a two-stage framework designed to improve the accuracy and interpretability of psychiatric diagnoses by learning brain graph representations with preserved structural semantics. The framework consists of a pre-training stage where an edge masker captures key structural semantics from a small labeled subset, and a self-supervised learning stage where this knowledge guides a structure-aware augmentation process for more meaningful representations. Experiments on real-world psychiatric datasets show that SAM-BG outperforms existing methods, especially in settings with limited labeled data, and reveals clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability. The code for SAM-BG is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process, enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability.

<div> Keywords: symbolic regression, Monte Carlo Tree Search, bandit allocation, state-jumping actions, numerical study

Summary:
In this study, an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework for symbolic regression is proposed to address limitations in traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction. The key innovations include an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions and evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover. These enhancements lead to improved search efficiency, robustness, and performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions. A thorough numerical study evaluates the impact of these improvements and benchmarks the approach against existing methods on various datasets. The results demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries, achieving a favorable balance between accuracy and model complexity on the Pareto frontier. The code for the proposed approach is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

Summary:
This paper introduces Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel framework for offline reinforcement learning that incorporates frequency-domain features to address the issue of trajectory instability caused by shifts in low-frequency components. By employing Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories and Short-Time Fourier Transform with cross attention mechanisms to extract and facilitate cross-frequency interaction, WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift and improves decision-making performance. Experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser outperforms existing methods by producing smoother, more stable trajectories. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However, existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother, more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by refining their capabilities.

<br />
Summary: DeepACTIF is a lightweight feature attribution method designed for interpreting deep learning models in time-series domains, particularly suited for real-time applications such as healthcare and human-AI interaction. By leveraging internal activations of LSTM-based networks, DeepACTIF efficiently estimates feature importance using an inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasizes stability and magnitude of activations across time steps. Evaluation on three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction and outperforms established methods like SHAP and IG in terms of accuracy and robustness. Through experiments, DeepACTIF is shown to reduce computation time and memory usage significantly while maintaining model accuracy with only the top-ranked features. This makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models, particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently. Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top 10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods, including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors.

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns, increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality and efficiency. The findings have implications for auditors, policymakers, and researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial oversight and risk management.

Summary: The article critically evaluates the effectiveness of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in hallucination detection, particularly focusing on their performance on the RAGTruth dataset. It is found that the high performance of SOTA methods is primarily due to a spurious correlation with the data. When this effect is controlled for, SOTA methods do not outperform supervised linear probes, necessitating extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. The analysis also reveals that out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, as all methods studied perform close to random in this regard. The article proposes a set of guidelines for both hallucination detection and its evaluation, highlighting the need for improved methods that can overcome current limitations in detecting and addressing hallucinations effectively. <div>

Out-of-distribution generalization is currently out of reach, with all of the analyzed methods performing close to random. We propose a set of guidelines for hallucination detection and its evaluation.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in expressing uncertainty, particularly in high-stakes domains like clinical diagnostics. Traditional methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities often lead to overconfidence and poor calibration. In this study, the authors propose an approach using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to address these issues. By treating LLMs as stochastic simulators and inferring posterior distributions over predictive probabilities, the ABC approach significantly improves accuracy (up to 46.9%) and reduces Brier scores by 74.4%. The method also enhances calibration, as demonstrated by improvements in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy. Evaluation on synthetic oral lesion diagnosis and a symptom-to-diagnosis dataset further validates the effectiveness of the ABC approach in improving the reliability and performance of LLMs in clinical settings.

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference, based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors focus on addressing temporal failures in RAG systems using two different methods applied to cybersecurity data. The first method involved a simple recency prior, which successfully achieved a high accuracy of 1.00 on freshness tasks. This result indicates the effectiveness of using recency as a factor in addressing temporal failures. However, the second method, which utilized a clustering heuristic for topic evolution, did not perform as well, as it yielded a low F1-score of 0.08. This outcome suggests that detecting trends in cybersecurity data requires more advanced methods beyond simple heuristics. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering different approaches and strategies when dealing with temporal failures in RAG systems, especially in the context of cybersecurity data analysis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

arXiv:2509.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance, requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

Summary: <br />
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is commonly used to enhance Transformers by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices into attention projections. However, existing methods treat these matrices as independent for each layer and projection, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, the authors propose TensLoRA, a unified framework that combines LoRA updates into higher-order tensors, allowing for a wide range of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. This approach offers mode-specific compression rates, enabling customization of parameter budgets based on modality and task. Experimental results on vision and language tasks demonstrate that the tensor construction significantly impacts performance, sometimes outperforming standard LoRA with similar parameter counts. TensLoRA provides a more versatile and efficient way to adapt Transformers, yielding improved results in various scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.

It also implements segment-wise decoding, treating each prediction horizon as a separate subtask to adapt to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements. Through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, TimeMosaic outperforms existing methods and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art TSFMs when trained on a large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations. The framework's innovative approach to capturing the diverse complexities of short-term and long-term forecasting horizons makes it a promising tool for various domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Summary:<br />
This study compares three techniques, SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, for credit default prediction, addressing the class imbalance issue. ML models were evaluated on imbalanced data to establish baseline performance before resampling. Ensemble boosting algorithms like XGBoost, AdaBoost, GBM, and Light GBM were tested with Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection. The Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier showed the best performance (F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in credit default prediction. This study lays the groundwork for enhancing credit default systems adaptability in the rising global credit market. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques, namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models (F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

Summary:<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management, and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

<div> sensitivity, distributional shifts, verification methodology, risk assessment, deep learning systems
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel methodology for evaluating and assessing the risks of deep learning systems, which are often sensitive to minor shifts in input data known as distributional shifts. These shifts, common in real-world scenarios, are not typically considered during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. The proposed approach estimates the probability of distributional shifts at runtime using out-of-distribution detectors and combines this with network correctness probabilities in a binary tree structure for accurate accuracy estimation. Tested on five datasets with varying distributional shift frequencies, the approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation methods with small estimation errors. In a medical segmentation benchmark, the approach demonstrates potential for risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses. This approach aims to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Summary:<br /><br /> This study introduces a novel approach, THINNs, for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems. By using a physically informed penalization strategy based on a large deviations principle, improbable deviations are penalized, leading to a thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs. Analytical a posteriori estimates are provided, and empirical comparisons with established penalization strategies are conducted to validate the efficacy of THINNs. This new approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of PINNs in modeling complex systems with fluctuating behavior. <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems, we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established penalization strategies.

<div> scalability, transformer modeling, multivariate time series, delegate tokens, noise-resilience<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces DELTAformer, a new method for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data to address scalability and performance issues. DELTAformer utilizes delegate tokens to constrain inter-variable mixing, improving signal focus and noise-resilience. The method scales linearly with variable count, outperforming standard transformers and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks. By strategically incorporating domain-specific challenges, DELTAformer demonstrates superior performance in noisy MTS environments, showcasing improved noise-resilience compared to standard transformers. The model's selective information propagation enhances signal relevance and overall effectiveness in MTS data analysis. Through effective constraint of inter-variable modeling, DELTAformer simultaneously improves scalability and performance, highlighting the potential for domain-specific design considerations to enhance transformer models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention (DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science applications.

The study introduces a frame-based diffusion paradigm for molecular generation that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance. Three variants are investigated: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD). By incorporating EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9 dataset. The results demonstrate high validity and uniqueness, with faster sampling compared to other methods. This approach maintains atom stability of 98.98% and molecular stability of 90.51%, outperforming equivariant baselines. The study highlights the importance of global structure preservation in molecular generation and establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm. <div>

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.

<br />
Summary: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) introduces a new method for learning dissipative dynamics without violating first principles. Unlike neural surrogates that can destabilize long-horizon rollouts, MCFM incorporates a conservative-dissipative split into the vector field and a structure preserving sampler. By training via conditional flow matching on short transitions, MCFM avoids the need for long rollout adjoints. During inference, a Strang-prox scheme ensures discrete energy decay through alternating symplectic updates and proximal metric steps. Additionally, an optional projection can enforce strict decay when trusted energy information is available. Continuous and discrete time guarantees connect MCFM's parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts. In experiments on a mechanical benchmark, MCFM produces phase portraits closer to ground truth and exhibits fewer instances of energy increase and positive energy rate events compared to unconstrained neural flows, while maintaining a comparable fit to the terminal distribution. <div>

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Summary:<br /><br />Diffusion-based world models have shown promise in generating realistic trajectories for offline RL but struggle with action generation. The proposed DAWM model addresses this limitation by incorporating actions into the trajectory generation process alongside states and rewards. This allows for compatibility with one-step TD-based offline RL algorithms. DAWM utilizes an inverse dynamics model for efficient action inference, leading to complete synthetic transitions that benefit conservative offline RL algorithms like TD3BC and IQL. Empirical results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of DAWM, with improved performance over existing diffusion-based baselines across various tasks. This modular design enhances training efficiency and enables better utilization of generated trajectories for offline RL algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2509.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference (TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work, and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

arXiv:2509.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules' input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

<div> Machine Learning, Antibody Design, Reformatting Success, Protein Language Models, Predictive Accuracy
Summary:
Machine learning is used to predict the success of reformatting antibodies from one format to another. The framework considers sequence, structure, and realistic deployment scenarios. Surprisingly, large pretrained protein language models do not outperform simple, domain-tailored representations, especially in challenging scenarios with new antibodies. The best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, allowing for the prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple, domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario, our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new approach, von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss, for deep hashing in time series data indexing. The proposed method aims to reduce information loss by mapping data to a hyperspherical space and modeling each data class with distinct vMF distributions. This allows for better separation between semantically different data samples, improving search and retrieval efficiency. The vMF hashing loss outperforms existing baselines in experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating compact binary representations for time series data. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available to facilitate further research and application in time series data mining. <div>

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes, but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing

<title>Mamba Modulation: On the Length Generalization of Mamba</title>

<div> spectrum scaling, state-space models, attention mechanism, Transformer models, language modeling<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of the Mamba architecture in handling long-context inputs, attributing it to the out-of-distribution behavior of its state-space dynamics and the structure of its state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike previous explanations focusing on the accumulation of discretization time steps, the authors link the model's sensitivity to context length extension to the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. To address this issue, they propose a spectrum scaling approach to selectively modulate the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer of pre-trained Mamba models. This technique demonstrates significant improvements in long-context generalization performance, providing a new perspective on enhancing state-space models for better handling of extended context lengths.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension. Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition matrices.

Summary:<br />
Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a challenging task due to scarcity of real data and temporal dependencies. The proposed TIMED framework integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a supervisor network for autoregressive dependencies, and a Wasserstein critic for temporal smoothness. It also includes a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss for feature space alignment. All components are optimized for sequence modeling and trained jointly to capture unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results show that TIMED outperforms state-of-the-art models in generating realistic and coherent sequences across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection, where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

<div> Keywords: Global Station Weather Forecasting, spatial correlation, attention mechanism, multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting, performance improvement<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel approach called Spatial Structured Attention Block for global station weather forecasting. This method addresses the limitation of existing time series forecasting methods by incorporating spatial correlation modeling. It partitions the spatial graph into subgraphs and utilizes both Intra-subgraph Attention and Inter-subgraph Attention to learn and represent local spatial correlation while considering global correlation. By expanding subgraph scales, a scalable and structured multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model is developed. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 16.8% improvement in performance compared to baseline methods, with low running costs. This approach enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of global weather forecasting for various sectors such as energy, aviation, and agriculture.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.

<div> Keywords: time series, digital health, self-supervised learning, data distribution shift, deep learning

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful patterns from noisy time series data in digital health using self-supervised learning. The proposed framework incorporates a bag-of-symbol representation to account for data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors. This representation is advantageous as it is insensitive to data warping, location shifts, and noise. By being aware of these factors, the deep learning model can better generalize across significant data shifts. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in scenarios where data shifting is substantial. The study highlights the importance of considering data distribution shift in deep learning models for time series data analysis in digital health applications. <div>
arXiv:2509.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance where significant data shifting exists.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel approach for distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) focusing on numerical data. The method utilizes wavelet expansions to express sample distributions, with a priority on estimating low-order coefficients for accurate macroscopic level estimation. By preventing probability mass from being misplaced far away from the true distribution, the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods under Wasserstein and KS distances. The theoretical guarantees of the method are also established. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the wavelet expansion method in accurately estimating distributions while preserving privacy under LDP. <div>

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein and KS distances.

<div> Keywords: Chest X-Rays, healthcare datasets, machine learning models, clinical context, pre-test probability

Summary: 
Machine learning models for Chest X-Ray (CXR) diagnosis, evaluated using prior discharge summaries to assess contextual knowledge available to clinicians, show better performance on cases with low pre-test probabilities compared to higher ones. The use of pre-test probability also helps distinguish true diagnostic signal from shortcut inference abilities, as evidenced by performance drops in a balanced test set without the shortcut. This analysis method, utilizing clinical context from discharge summaries, offers a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation approach for evaluating clinical vision models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a ``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs. Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis, using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

<div> Keywords: Federated continual learning, prompt-based methods, class-wise knowledge coherence, C${}^2$Prompt, task data<br />
Summary:<br />
Federated continual learning (FCL) deals with learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients. Existing prompt-based FCL methods face challenges related to class-wise knowledge coherence, leading to intra-class distribution gaps and inter-prompt class-wise relevance issues. To tackle these issues, the Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method is proposed. It includes a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) to reduce intra-class distribution disparities and a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) to enhance class-relevant knowledge aggregation during prompt communication. By explicitly addressing class-wise coherence, C${}^2$Prompt outperforms existing methods in FCL benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The source code for C${}^2$Prompt is publicly available for further research and applications. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts, intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<div> Adam, continual learning, trainability, optimization, ReLU <br />
Summary:
The article investigates the issue of Loss of Trainability (LoT) in continual learning and analyzes it through an optimization perspective. Traditional indicators like Hessian rank, sharpness level, and gradient norms are found to be unreliable predictors of LoT in Adam optimization. Instead, the study introduces two new criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that together form a per-layer predictive threshold. By using this threshold, a simple per-layer scheduler is developed to maintain effective step sizes within safe limits, thereby stabilizing training and enhancing accuracy across various methods including CReLU and regularization techniques. The learned learning-rate trajectories generated by this approach mirror standard decay patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling the trainability issue in continual learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2509.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios, and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit, stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU), Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Summary: 
The study focuses on training a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks without providing the model with normal equations or handcrafted iterations. The model learns to predict missing blocks, including scalar targets and unseen kernel slices for Nyström extrapolation, through input-output pairs and mean-squared loss. Surprisingly, the model uncovers a parameter-free update rule through algebraic unrolling, demonstrating second-order convergence on full-batch problems and reducing complexity in distributed iterations. The model remains accurate even with rank-limited attention and adapts to different computational regimes. This research showcases the capability of in-context learning, where a transformer trained for patching missing blocks implicitly discovers a unified iterative solver for various tasks like prediction, estimation, and Nyström extrapolation. <div>

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss; it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation). We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a powerful capability of in-context learning.

Summary:
Surgical decision-making in complex procedures like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction requires accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs). Traditional statistical methods struggle with heterogeneous data, leading to limited accuracy. In this study, a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, is developed to model surgical decisions as distinct tasks while learning shared representations. The framework incorporates inverse probability weighting (IPW) to enhance causal validity. Evaluation on spinal fusion and scoliosis datasets demonstrates superior performance in estimating treatment effects and predicting patient-reported outcomes. The model achieves high AUC values, outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation, and provides robust patient-specific causal estimates. X-MultiTask has the potential to advance personalized surgical care, improve patient outcomes, and is available for use on GitHub.

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision (e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs. posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset (368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs. non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ (0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains, with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902. By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient outcomes.

This research introduces a novel method for noninvasively predicting arterial blood pressure (ABP) using speech signals. The traditional cuff-based methods for ABP monitoring can yield inconsistent results, but by leveraging the acoustic characteristics of speech and employing advanced deep learning techniques, this study successfully captures voice features to establish correlations with blood pressure levels. The model, based on BERT regression, achieved impressive performance metrics with mean absolute errors of 1.36 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 1.24 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The robustness of the model was demonstrated by high R-scores of 0.99 and 0.94 for SBP and DBP, respectively. The analysis of training and validation loss also indicated effective learning with minimal overfitting. This approach not only provides an accurate and user-friendly method for blood pressure assessment but also holds significant implications for enhancing patient care and proactive management of cardiovascular health.

Summary: Frictional Q-learning is introduced as a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control tasks. Drawing an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and extrapolation error in off-policy RL, the algorithm incorporates a constraint to prevent the policy from drifting towards unsupported actions. By constraining the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to that in the replay buffer while maintaining a distance from the orthonormal action space manifold, the algorithm effectively addresses extrapolation error. This constraint, inspired by the concept of friction, simplifies the batch-constrained reinforcement learning approach and offers a physical interpretation of the error. Empirically, Frictional Q-learning demonstrates robust training and competitive performance on standard continuous control benchmarks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.

Summary:  
Sobolev training, a technique incorporating target derivatives in loss functions, has been proven to speed up convergence and enhance generalization in comparison to standard $L^2$ training. However, the precise mechanisms behind this method were not fully understood. This study establishes a theoretical framework demonstrating that Sobolev training quickens convergence in Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Using a student-teacher setup with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, the research provides exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, illustrating improved conditioning of the loss landscape and faster convergence rates via gradient flow. Extensive experiments confirm these theoretical results and demonstrate that the advantages of Sobolev training are applicable to contemporary deep learning tasks. <div>

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep learning tasks.

arXiv:2509.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis. Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges, including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than 118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world cardiovascular screening.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel approach called Tanbr for efficient online inference in Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models. Tanbr addresses the challenges of large model size and complex expert routing by estimating task distribution from historical data. It utilizes a binary tree to generate candidate merging weights, applying neural bandit to determine optimal expert merging. Tanbr achieves a sublinear regret bound of O(sqrt(T) log(T)) over T rounds, matching existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate Tanbr's effectiveness in reducing inference latency by 45% and memory usage by up to 25%, while maintaining high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Tanbr's task-aware expert merging capability enhances online inference efficiency and reliability, making it a promising solution for real-time applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing, especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that \texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$}, while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
- Human drivers focus on a few agents at a time, while autonomous systems handle complex scenes with multiple agents.
- Existing attention mechanisms for agent interactions are computationally expensive due to their quadratic nature.
- RDAR proposes a strategy to learn per-agent relevance by identifying which agents impact the controlled vehicle's behavior.
- RDAR formulates the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process, where actions determine agent exclusion.
- Evaluation on a large driving dataset shows RDAR's ability to accurately measure relevance while processing fewer agents than state-of-the-art models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.

<div> Keywords: Policy-based reinforcement learning, mathematical reasoning tasks, rollout-based reinforcement learning, difficulty levels, curriculum reinforcement learning.

Summary: 
Policy-based reinforcement learning techniques are vital for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based methods do not consider LLMs' learning ability across samples of varying difficulty levels. A new framework called VCRL is proposed, which adjusts the sample difficulty based on the variance of group rewards in reinforcement learning. Samples with moderate difficulty exhibit higher variance, indicating their suitability for training. Experimental results on multiple mathematical benchmarks and models demonstrate the superiority of VCRL over current LLM RL approaches. This approach aligns with the human cognitive process of solving mathematical problems starting from easy to difficult ones, enhancing the performance of LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels, which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter (CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate $O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a structured alternative to existing methods.

<div> Keywords: boreal forests, carbon sequestration, permafrost preservation, reinforcement learning, multi-objective optimization

Summary:<br />
1. The study focuses on boreal forests, which store a significant amount of terrestrial carbon and are crucial for climate mitigation due to their vulnerability to permafrost thaw.
2. The researchers introduce BoreaRL, a multi-objective reinforcement learning environment designed for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, incorporating a simulator of energy, carbon, and water fluxes.
3. Carbon objectives are found to be easier to optimize compared to thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, highlighting the complexity of balancing these competing goals.
4. Different management strategies emerge from the analysis, with carbon-focused policies favoring high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies prioritize species composition and density to protect permafrost while maximizing carbon gains.
5. The study underscores the challenges in developing robust climate-adaptive forest management strategies using current multi-objective reinforcement learning methods, underscoring the need for further research in this area.<br />

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation. However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms: site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings, standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate applications.

<div> transformer-based models, symbolic regression, generalization, pre-training data, out-of-distribution challenges 

Summary: 
- Symbolic regression algorithms use Transformer-based models to search for mathematical expressions that fit given data, reducing the need for expensive combinatorial searches. 
- The success of these models depends heavily on their pre-training data, with their ability to generalize to new problems largely unexplored. 
- A systematic study was conducted to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained transformer-based symbolic regression models, showing a significant gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. 
- While these models perform well within their pre-training data, their performance degrades in scenarios outside this distribution, limiting their practical applications in real-world problems. 
- The findings suggest that addressing this generalization gap is crucial to enhance the usability of pre-trained approaches for broader applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a method to address the challenge of unbalanced classification tasks in machine learning by distinguishing critical instances near the decision boundary from redundant samples in the core of the data distribution. The proposed boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score significantly on benchmark datasets, while the core-aware reduction method compresses datasets without sacrificing accuracy. This has implications for efficient model training, especially in computationally demanding domains like Large Language Model (LLM) training. The approach prioritizes decision-relevant data, leading to faster convergence, improved generalization, and substantial computational savings. The method can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to intelligent sampling for data-efficient learning and driving advancements in AI technologies. The code for the method is available as a Python package for easy implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\% on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements.

NextHAM is a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. It introduces zeroth-step Hamiltonians as informative descriptors and initial estimates for the regression model to predict correction terms to target Hamiltonians. The neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry is used for prediction, along with a novel training objective to ensure accuracy in both real and reciprocal space.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

arXiv:2509.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm. Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry. We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets. In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines, particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited settings.

<title>PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2509.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems: human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME 24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5), surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future open-source models. The implementation is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/PromptCoT.

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy, yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free, tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm, bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

<title>Latent Iterative Refinement Flow: A Geometric-Constrained Approach for Few-Shot Generation</title>

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling. Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss} $L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle, candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem} demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

<title>On the Fragility of Contribution Score Computation in Federated Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical need for more robust evaluation schemes.

<title>Exploration with Foundation Models: Capabilities, Limitations, and Hybrid Approaches</title>

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap, we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20 examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii) Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript, and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use multimodal construction to improve interpretability.

<title>TABFAIRGDT: A Fast Fair Tabular Data Generator using Autoregressive Decision Trees</title>

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models, achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably, TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU, making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover, it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems, and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum harmonic oscillator.

<title>Learnable Sampler Distillation for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/feiyangfu/LSD}{https://github.com/feiyangfu/LSD}.

<title>From Samples to Scenarios: A New Paradigm for Probabilistic Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.

<title>Faster Than SVD, Smarter Than SGD: The OPLoRA Alternating Update</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine (LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

<title>RAD: Towards Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Multi-modal Clinical Diagnosis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters, neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover, recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis.

<title>Pi-Transformer: A Physics-informed Attention Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

<title>Learning Robust Penetration-Testing Policies under Partial Observability: A systematic evaluation</title>

arXiv:2509.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size, aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go beyond quantitative results.

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework, \textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM, LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second, we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks. Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization, capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

arXiv:2509.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks, including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and imputing partially observed dynamics.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making. However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks. Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50 samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs) under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition, and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained} optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood. In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution. We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between embedding organization and semantic patterns.

<title>Generative Model Inversion Through the Lens of the Manifold Hypothesis</title>

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process, yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

<title>An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity</title>

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

<title>FairEquityFL -- A Fair and Equitable Client Selection in Federated Learning for Heterogeneous IoV Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process. The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset, FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline models to a considerable extent.

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold. We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular, but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets, highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical experiments.

<title>Q-Palette: Fractional-Bit Quantizers Toward Optimal Bit Allocation for Efficient LLM Deployment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Q-Palette.

<title>Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HGMamba-ncRNA-94D0.

<title>Energy Use of AI Inference: Efficiency Pathways and Test-Time Compute</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200 billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8 GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day, similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains during the internet and cloud build-up.

<title>Dynamic Lagging for Time-Series Forecasting in E-Commerce Finance: Mitigating Information Loss with A Hybrid ML Architecture</title>

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5% reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method. Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.

<title>Extended Low-Rank Approximation Accelerates Learning of Elastic Response in Heterogeneous Materials</title>

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results across representative material systems, including two phase composites and single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary, xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/judgment-to-noise-947D/README.md

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as $\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks, where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered. Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.

<title>Feature Dynamics as Implicit Data Augmentation: A Depth-Decomposed View on Deep Neural Network Generalization</title>

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones. This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability. Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization, which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise. Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of \textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of \textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common neonatal anomaly, highlighting the urgent need for early detection to improve outcomes. Yet, fetal ECG (fECG) signals in abdominal ECG (aECG) are often masked by maternal ECG and noise, challenging conventional methods under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose FetalHealthNet (FHNet), a deep learning framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks with a multi-scale enhanced transformer to dynamically model spatiotemporal inter-lead correlations and extract clean fECG signals. On benchmark aECG datasets, FHNet consistently outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM) models, standard transformers, and state-of-the-art models, achieving R2>0.99 and RMSE = 0.015 even under severe noise. Interpretability analyses highlight physiologically meaningful temporal and lead contributions, supporting model transparency and clinical trust. FHNet illustrates the potential of AI-driven modeling to advance fetal monitoring and enable early CHD screening, underscoring the transformative impact of next-generation biomedical signal processing.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.

Abstract: As the consumption of traditional energy sources intensifies and their adverse environmental impacts become more pronounced, wave energy stands out as a highly promising member of the renewable energy family due to its high energy density, stability, widespread distribution, and environmental friendliness. The key to its development lies in the precise prediction of Significant Wave Height (WVHT). However, wave energy signals exhibit strong nonlinearity, abrupt changes, multi-scale periodicity, data sparsity, and high-frequency noise interference; additionally, physical models for wave energy prediction incur extremely high computational costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model combining STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM. This model exploits the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess (STL), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technologies. The model aims to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, capture extreme wave heights, and address issues related to high-frequency noise and periodic signals, thereby achieving efficient and accurate prediction of significant wave height. Experiments were conducted using hourly data from NOAA Station 41008 and 41047 spanning 2019 to 2022. The results showed that compared with other single models and hybrid models, the STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM model achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy in capturing extreme wave heights and suppressing high-frequency noise, with MAE reduced by 15.8\%-40.5\%, SMAPE reduced by 8.3\%-20.3\%, and R increased by 1.31\%-2.9\%; in ablation experiments, the model also demonstrated the indispensability of each component step, validating its superiority in multi-scale feature fusion.

Abstract: Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset, including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64, +15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening, pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and congenital heart disease populations.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.

Abstract: Human activity recognition is critical for applications such as early intervention and health analytics. Traditional activity recognition relies on inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are resource intensive and require calibration. Although electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods have been explored, these have typically served as supplements to IMUs or have been limited to broad categorical classification such as fall detection or active vs. inactive in daily activities. In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be further improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates the first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical activities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation wearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition without additional motion sensors.

Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks. The open-source library is publicly accessible at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/2025ULUIUBUEUMUEUR485384

Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects. We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/EonHao/Holographic-Transformers.

Abstract: To address the issue of limited channels and insufficient information collection in portable EEG devices, this study explores an EEG virtual channel signal generation network using a novel spatio-temporal feature fusion strategy. Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.

Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness, LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation. This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework in localization and channel modeling.

Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions. However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension. ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse computational problems.

Abstract: The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is known to be involved in olfactory learning and memory; the synaptic plasticity of the Kenyon cell (KC) to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) synapses plays a key role in the learning process. Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling. However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead, limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases, coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial parameter selection.

Abstract: We present a sensor-fusion framework for rapid, non-destructive classification and quality control of organic substances, built on a standard Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller platform equipped with three commercial environmental and gas sensors. All data used in this study were generated in-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired samples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and cardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup, resulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was employed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised learning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were trained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing models, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test accuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that low-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with advanced machine learning and correlation-driven feature engineering, enable reliable identification and quality control of organic compounds.

Abstract: This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly electricity demand in C\'ordoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of 0.95. The inclusion of periodic temporal encodings and weather variables proved crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii) an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.

<title>Data-Driven Reconstruction of Significant Wave Heights from Sparse Observations</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover 32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.

<title>A Statistical Mixture-of-Experts Framework for EMG Artifact Removal in EEG: Empirical Insights and a Proof-of-Concept Application</title>

Abstract: Effective control of neural interfaces is limited by poor signal quality. While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification, (2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.

Abstract: Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) are the electroencephalographic hallmark of absence epilepsy, yet their manual identification in multi-day recordings remains labour-intensive and error-prone. We present a lightweight hybrid pipeline that couples analytical features with a shallow artificial neural network (ANN) for accurate, patient-specific SWD detection in long-term, monopolar EEG. A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the high-frequency components of normal background activity. The residual signal is then summarised by the mean and the standard deviation of its normally distributed samples, yielding a compact, two-dimensional feature vector for every 20s window. These features are fed to a single-hidden-layer ANN trained via back-propagation to classify each window as SWD or non-SWD. The method was evaluated on 780 channels sampled at 256 Hz from 12 patients, comprising 392 annotated SWD events. It correctly detected 384 events (sensitivity: 98%) while achieving a specificity of 96.2 % and an overall accuracy of 97.2%. Because feature extraction is analytic, and the classifier is small, the pipeline runs in real-time and requires no manual threshold tuning. These results indicate that normal-distribution descriptors combined with a modest ANN provide an effective and computationally inexpensive solution for automated SWD screening in extended EEG recordings.

<title>Self-Alignment Learning to Improve Myocardial Infarction Detection from Single-Lead ECG</title>

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be publicly available after acceptance.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.

Abstract: Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.

Abstract: The Internet Yellow Pages (IYP) aggregates information from multiple sources about Internet routing into a unified, graph-based knowledge base.

In this paper, we propose ChatIYP, a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to query IYP through natural language questions. Our evaluation demonstrates solid performance on simple queries, as well as directions for improvement, and provides insights for selecting evaluation metrics that are better fit for IYP querying AI agents.

Abstract: Classifying hadronic jets using their constituents' kinematic information is a critical task in modern high-energy collider physics. Often, classifiers are designed by targeting the best performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, or rejection rates. However, the use of a single metric can lead to the use of architectures that are more model-dependent than competitive alternatives, leading to potential uncertainty and bias in analysis. We explore such trade-offs and demonstrate the consequences of using networks with high performance metrics but low resilience.

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where global methods fail.

Abstract: We test the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) in astronomy by measuring representational convergence across a range of foundation models trained on different data types. Using spectroscopic and imaging observations from JWST, HSC, Legacy Survey, and DESI, we compare representations from vision transformers, self-supervised models, and astronomy-specific architectures via mutual $k$-nearest neighbour analysis. We observe consistent scaling: representational alignment generally increases with model capacity across our tested architectures, supporting convergence toward a shared representation of galaxy astrophysics. Our results suggest that astronomical foundation models can use pre-trained general-purpose architectures, allowing us to capitalise on the broader machine learning community's already-spent computational investment.

Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Standard first-order Langevin algorithms such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) are obtained by discretizing the Langevin diffusion and are widely used for sampling in machine learning because they scale to high dimensions and large datasets. However, they face two key limitations: (i) they require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions. The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions. The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/SEIL.git.

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme -- in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

Abstract: In this short note, we study the impact of data augmentation on the smoothness of principal components of high-dimensional datasets. Using tools from quantum harmonic analysis, we show that eigenfunctions of operators corresponding to augmented data sets lie in the modulation space $M^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, guaranteeing smoothness and continuity. Numerical examples on synthetic and audio data confirm the theoretical findings. While interesting in itself, the results suggest that manifold learning and feature extraction algorithms can benefit from systematic and informed augmentation principles.

Abstract: Humans can flexibly interpret and compose different goal specifications, such as language instructions, spatial coordinates, or visual references, when navigating to a destination. In contrast, most existing robotic navigation policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric, semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities, and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe OmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation policies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation models. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its checkpoints and training code on our project page.

<title>AIRwaves at CheckThat! 2025: Retrieving Scientific Sources for Implicit Claims on Social Media with Dual Encoders and Neural Re-Ranking</title>

Abstract: Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original publications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly discourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and domain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval pipelines.

<title>Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517</link>

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

<title>AnySafe: Adapting Latent Safety Filters at Runtime via Safety Constraint Parameterization in the Latent Space</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19555</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that foundational safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, can be applied in the latent space of world models. While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error scores by up to 23.83%.

Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.

Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in language modeling, but the challenge of uncertainty quantification remains open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3 semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when reconstructing patches. The uncertainty is also influenced by the script, with Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.

Abstract: Time series analysis has emerged as an important tool for improving patient diagnosis and management in healthcare applications. However, these applications commonly face two critical challenges: time misalignment and data sparsity. Traditional approaches address these issues through a two-step process of imputation followed by prediction. We propose MAGIC (Multi-tAsk Gaussian Process for Imputation and Classification), a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs class-informed missing value imputation and label prediction within a hierarchical multi-task Gaussian process coupled with functional logistic regression. To handle intractable likelihood components, MAGIC employs Taylor expansion approximations with bounded error analysis, and parameter estimation is performed using EM algorithm with block coordinate optimization supported by convergence analysis. We validate MAGIC through two healthcare applications: prediction of post-traumatic headache improvement following mild traumatic brain injury and prediction of in-hospital mortality within 48 hours after ICU admission. In both applications, MAGIC achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods. The ability to generate real-time and accurate predictions with limited samples facilitates early clinical assessment and treatment planning, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed treatment decisions.

Abstract: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.

<title>What Does Your Benchmark Really Measure? A Framework for Robust Inference of AI Capabilities</title>

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance? Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations. After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together, these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and additional information can be found at https://ego-bridge.github.io

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments. Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust, scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation hyperspectral missions.

Abstract: Online classification is a central problem in optimization, statistical learning and data science. Classical algorithms such as the perceptron offer efficient updates and finite mistake guarantees on linearly separable data, but they do not exploit the underlying geometric structure of the classification problem. We study the offline maximum margin problem through its dual formulation and use the resulting geometric insights to design a principled and efficient algorithm for the online setting. A key feature of our method is its translation invariance, inherited from the offline formulation, which plays a central role in its performance analysis. Our theoretical analysis yields improved mistake and margin bounds that depend only on translation-invariant quantities, offering stronger guarantees than existing algorithms under the same assumptions in favorable settings. In particular, we identify a parameter regime where our algorithm makes at most two mistakes per sequence, whereas the perceptron can be forced to make arbitrarily many mistakes. Our numerical study on real data further demonstrates that our method matches the computational efficiency of existing online algorithms, while significantly outperforming them in accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a framework that enables neural models to "think while listening" to everyday sounds, thereby enhancing audio classification performance. Motivated by recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, we address two central questions: (i) how can thinking be incorporated into existing audio classification pipelines to enable reasoning in the category space and improve performance, and (ii) can a new architecture be designed from the ground up to support both thinking and test-time scaling? We demonstrate that in both settings, our models exhibit improved classification accuracy. Leveraging test-time scaling, we observe consistent gains as the number of sampled traces increases. Furthermore, we evaluate two open-source reasoning models, GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-14B, showing that while such models are capable of zero-shot reasoning, a lightweight approach--retraining only the embedding matrix of a frozen, smaller model like GPT-2--can surpass the performance of billion-parameter text-based reasoning models.

Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30 success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Abstract: Copulas are a fundamental tool for modelling multivariate dependencies in data, forming the method of choice in diverse fields and applications. However, the adoption of existing models for multimodal and high-dimensional dependencies is hindered by restrictive assumptions and poor scaling. In this work, we present methods for modelling copulas based on the principles of diffusions and flows. We design two processes that progressively forget inter-variable dependencies while leaving dimension-wise distributions unaffected, provably defining valid copulas at all times. We show how to obtain copula models by learning to remember the forgotten dependencies from each process, theoretically recovering the true copula at optimality. The first instantiation of our framework focuses on direct density estimation, while the second specialises in expedient sampling. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art copula approaches in modelling complex and high-dimensional dependencies from scientific datasets and images. Our work enhances the representational power of copula models, empowering applications and paving the way for their adoption on larger scales and more challenging domains.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive real-world evaluation of AI-assisted software development tools deployed at enterprise scale. Over one year, 300 engineers across multiple teams integrated an in-house AI platform (DeputyDev) that combines code generation and automated review capabilities into their daily workflows. Through rigorous cohort analysis, our study demonstrates statistically significant productivity improvements, including an overall 31.8% reduction in PR review cycle time.
  Developer adoption was strong, with 85% satisfaction for code review features and 93% expressing a desire to continue using the platform. Adoption patterns showed systematic scaling from 4% engagement in month 1 to 83% peak usage by month 6, stabilizing at 60% active engagement. Top adopters achieved a 61% increase in code volume pushed to production, contributing to approximately 30 to 40% of code shipped to production through this tool, accounting for an overall 28% increase in code shipment volume.
  Unlike controlled benchmark evaluations, our longitudinal analysis provides empirical evidence from production environments, revealing both the transformative potential and practical deployment challenges of integrating AI into enterprise software development workflows.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions. Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

Abstract: A common way to estimate an unknown convex regression function $f_0: \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ from a set of $n$ noisy observations is to fit a convex function that minimizes the sum of squared errors. However, this estimator is known for its tendency to overfit near the boundary of $\Omega$, posing significant challenges in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator of $f_0$ that avoids this overfitting by minimizing a penalty on the subgradient while enforcing an upper bound $s_n$ on the sum of squared errors. The key advantage of this method is that $s_n$ can be directly estimated from the data. We establish the uniform almost sure consistency of the proposed estimator and its subgradient over $\Omega$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and derive convergence rates. The effectiveness of our estimator is illustrated through its application to estimating waiting times in a single-server queue.

Abstract: We address the Statistical Process Control (SPC) of high-dimensional, dynamic industrial processes from two complementary perspectives: manifold fitting and manifold learning, both of which assume data lies on an underlying nonlinear, lower dimensional space. We propose two distinct monitoring frameworks for online or 'phase II' Statistical Process Control (SPC). The first method leverages state-of-the-art techniques in manifold fitting to accurately approximate the manifold where the data resides within the ambient high-dimensional space. It then monitors deviations from this manifold using a novel scalar distribution-free control chart. In contrast, the second method adopts a more traditional approach, akin to those used in linear dimensionality reduction SPC techniques, by first embedding the data into a lower-dimensional space before monitoring the embedded observations. We prove how both methods provide a controllable Type I error probability, after which they are contrasted for their corresponding fault detection ability. Extensive numerical experiments on a synthetic process and on a replicated Tennessee Eastman Process show that the conceptually simpler manifold-fitting approach achieves performance competitive with, and sometimes superior to, the more classical lower-dimensional manifold monitoring methods. In addition, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed manifold-fitting approach by successfully detecting surface anomalies in a real image dataset of electrical commutators.

Abstract: Deep learning is increasingly used for complex, large-scale systems where first-principles modeling is difficult. However, standard deep learning models often fail to enforce physical structure or preserve convexity in downstream control, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and discontinuous inputs owing to nonconvexity. We introduce sign constraints--sign restrictions on Jacobian entries--that unify monotonicity, positivity, and sign-definiteness; additionally, we develop model-construction methods that enforce them, together with a control-synthesis procedure. In particular, we design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.

<title>Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.

Abstract: Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection.

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Abstract: In 2011, einsum was introduced to NumPy as a practical and convenient notation for tensor expressions in machine learning, quantum circuit simulation, and other fields. It has since been implemented in additional Python frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other programming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum notation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the different frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and systematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor expressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on this definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor expressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates, creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a "nuisance space" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation techniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline space flexibility while introducing "gravitational" terms that encourage convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits and enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: Secure monitoring and dynamic control in an IIoT environment are major requirements for current development goals. We believe that dynamic, secure monitoring of the IIoT environment can be achieved through integration with the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Digital Twin (DT) paradigms. The current literature lacks implementation details for SDN-based DT and time-aware intelligent model training for short-term anomaly detection against IIoT threats. Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly detection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware labeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm. According to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU- accelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of high recall and strong classification performance.

Abstract: Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods. We make the code available at https://hyperspectraladapter.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem. Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.

Abstract: Consider N players and K games taking place simultaneously. Each of these games is modeled as a Tug-of-War (ToW) game where increasing the action of one player decreases the reward for all other players. Each player participates in only one game at any given time. At each time step, a player decides the game in which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game. Their reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game. This system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game. These games can model scenarios such as power control, distributed task allocation, and activation in sensor networks. We propose the Meta Tug-of-Peace algorithm, a distributed algorithm where the action updates are done using a simple stochastic approximation algorithm, and the decision to switch games is made using an infrequent 1-bit communication between the players. We prove that in Meta-ToW games, our algorithm converges to an equilibrium that satisfies a target Quality of Service reward vector for the players. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through simulations for the scenarios mentioned above.

Abstract: API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models~(LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models were able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar pipelines.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance towards texture.

Abstract: This paper investigates theoretical and methodological foundations for stochastic optimal control (SOC) in discrete time. We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.

<title>Feeding Two Birds or Favoring One? Adequacy-Fluency Tradeoffs in Evaluation and Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation</title>

Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly, we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.

<title>Ads that Stick: Near-Optimal Ad Optimization through Psychological Behavior Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20304</link>

Abstract: Optimizing the timing and frequency of ads is a central problem in digital advertising, with significant economic consequences. Existing scheduling policies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps, that overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users' long-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several psychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).
  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on three key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and operant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave function of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is modeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user interest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask the following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads should be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the ads?
  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of displayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the operant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm that outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the performance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small. Our algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and shows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many natural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on the mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a simple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings with experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various baselines.

Abstract: Exoplanet imaging is a major challenge in astrophysics due to the need for high angular resolution and high contrast. We present a multi-scale statistical model for the nuisance component corrupting multivariate image series at high contrast. Integrated into a learnable architecture, it leverages the physics of the problem and enables the fusion of multiple observations of the same star in a way that is optimal in terms of detection signal-to-noise ratio. Applied to data from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, the method significantly improves the detection sensitivity and the accuracy of astrometric and photometric estimation.

Abstract: Hope speech language that fosters encouragement and optimism plays a vital role in promoting positive discourse online. However, its detection remains challenging, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection using an active learning approach and transformer-based models, including mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, German, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our results show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional baselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy. Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even with small annotated datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining multilingual transformers with data-efficient training strategies for hope speech detection.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics. VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at: https://visualmimic.github.io .

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of high-quality synthetic data -- generated by advanced AI models or collected as auxiliary data from related tasks -- presents both opportunities and challenges for statistical inference. This paper introduces a GEneral Synthetic-Powered Inference (GESPI) framework that wraps around any statistical inference procedure to safely enhance sample efficiency by combining synthetic and real data. Our framework leverages high-quality synthetic data to boost statistical power, yet adaptively defaults to the standard inference method using only real data when synthetic data is of low quality. The error of our method remains below a user-specified bound without any distributional assumptions on the synthetic data, and decreases as the quality of the synthetic data improves. This flexibility enables seamless integration with conformal prediction, risk control, hypothesis testing, and multiple testing procedures, all without modifying the base inference method. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging tasks with limited labeled data, including AlphaFold protein structure prediction, and comparing large reasoning models on complex math problems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a vector-valued objective function $\boldsymbol{f}$ sampled from a Gaussian Process (GP) whose index set is a well-behaved, compact metric space $({\cal X},d)$ of designs. We assume that $\boldsymbol{f}$ is not known beforehand and that evaluating $\boldsymbol{f}$ at design $x$ results in a noisy observation of $\boldsymbol{f}(x)$. Since identifying the Pareto optimal designs via exhaustive search is infeasible when the cardinality of ${\cal X}$ is large, we propose an algorithm, called Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL, that exploits the smoothness of the GP-sampled function and the structure of $({\cal X},d)$ to learn fast. In essence, Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL employs a tree-based adaptive discretization technique to identify an $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set of designs in as few evaluations as possible. We provide both information-type and metric dimension-type bounds on the sample complexity of $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set identification. We also experimentally show that our algorithm outperforms other Pareto set identification methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are predominantly developed for stationary environments, and the limited literature that considers nonstationary environments often involves specific assumptions about changes that can occur in transition probability matrices and reward functions. Considering that real-world applications involve environments that continuously evolve due to various external events, and humans make decisions by discerning patterns in historical events, this study investigates Markov Decision Processes under the influence of an external temporal process. We establish the conditions under which the problem becomes tractable, allowing it to be addressed by considering only a finite history of events, based on the properties of the perturbations introduced by the exogenous process. We propose and theoretically analyze a policy iteration algorithm to tackle this problem, which learns policies contingent upon the current state of the environment, as well as a finite history of prior events of the exogenous process. We show that such an algorithm is not guaranteed to converge. However, we provide a guarantee for policy improvement in regions of the state space determined by the approximation error induced by considering tractable policies and value functions. We also establish the sample complexity of least-squares policy evaluation and policy improvement algorithms that consider approximations due to the incorporation of only a finite history of temporal events. While our results are applicable to general discrete-time processes satisfying certain conditions on the rate of decay of the influence of their events, we further analyze the case of discrete-time Hawkes processes with Gaussian marks. We performed experiments to demonstrate our findings for policy evaluation and deployment in traditional control environments.

Abstract: On tabular data, a significant body of literature has shown that current deep learning (DL) models perform at best similarly to Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), while significantly underperforming them on outlier data. However, these works often study idealized problem settings which may fail to capture complexities of real-world scenarios. We identify a natural tabular data setting where DL models can outperform GBDTs: tabular Learning-to-Rank (LTR) under label scarcity. Tabular LTR applications, including search and recommendation, often have an abundance of unlabeled data, and scarce labeled data. We show that DL rankers can utilize unsupervised pretraining to exploit this unlabeled data. In extensive experiments over both public and proprietary datasets, we show that pretrained DL rankers consistently outperform GBDT rankers on ranking metrics -- sometimes by as much as 38% -- both overall and on outliers.

Abstract: Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.

Abstract: Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF. The code is available at https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/STELLA.

Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss and showing that it can lead to higher compression and better generation. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.

Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.

Abstract: Computational wave imaging (CWI) extracts hidden structure and physical properties of a volume of material by analyzing wave signals that traverse that volume. Applications include seismic exploration of the Earth's subsurface, acoustic imaging and non-destructive testing in material science, and ultrasound computed tomography in medicine. Current approaches for solving CWI problems can be divided into two categories: those rooted in traditional physics, and those based on deep learning. Physics-based methods stand out for their ability to provide high-resolution and quantitatively accurate estimates of acoustic properties within the medium. However, they can be computationally intensive and are susceptible to ill-posedness and nonconvexity typical of CWI problems. Machine learning-based computational methods have recently emerged, offering a different perspective to address these challenges. Diverse scientific communities have independently pursued the integration of deep learning in CWI. This review discusses how contemporary scientific machine-learning (ML) techniques, and deep neural networks in particular, have been developed to enhance and integrate with traditional physics-based methods for solving CWI problems.
  We present a structured framework that consolidates existing research spanning multiple domains, including computational imaging, wave physics, and data science. This study concludes with important lessons learned from existing ML-based methods and identifies technical hurdles and emerging trends through a systematic analysis of the extensive literature on this topic.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.

Abstract: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers expose hundreds of parameters that have an outsized impact on performance but are difficult to configure for all but expert users. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches require training on thousands of related instances, generalize poorly and can be difficult to integrate into existing solver workflows. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based framework that configures cutting plane separators using problem descriptions and solver-specific separator summaries. To reduce variance in LLM outputs, we introduce an ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates candidate configurations into a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our method requires no custom solver interface, generates configurations in seconds via simple API calls, and requires solving only a small number of instances. Extensive experiments on standard synthetic and real-world MILPs show our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art configuration methods with a fraction of the data and computation.

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that mutual distillation between reinforcement learning policies serves as an implicit regularization, preventing them from overfitting to irrelevant features. We highlight two separate contributions: (i) Theoretically, for the first time, we prove that enhancing the policy robustness to irrelevant features leads to improved generalization performance. (ii) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Ultimately, we do not claim to achieve state-of-the-art performance but rather focus on uncovering the underlying principles of generalization and deepening our understanding of its mechanisms.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), in which a momentum term is added to SGD, has been well studied in both theory and practice. The theoretical studies show that the settings of the learning rate and momentum weight affect the convergence of SGDM. Meanwhile, the practical studies have shown that the batch-size setting strongly affects the performance of SGDM. In this paper, we focus on mini-batch SGDM with a constant learning rate and constant momentum weight, which is frequently used to train deep neural networks. We show theoretically that using a constant batch size does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss in training a deep neural network, whereas using an increasing batch size definitely minimizes it; that is, an increasing batch size improves the convergence of mini-batch SGDM. We also provide numerical results supporting our analyses, indicating specifically that mini-batch SGDM with an increasing batch size converges to stationary points faster than with a constant batch size, while also reducing computational cost. Python implementations of the optimizers used in the numerical experiments are available at https://github.com/iiduka-researches/NSHB_increasing_batchsize_acml25/.

Abstract: Bias-variance decompositions are widely used to understand the generalization performance of machine learning models. While the squared error loss permits a straightforward decomposition, other loss functions - such as zero-one loss or $L_1$ loss - either fail to sum bias and variance to the expected loss or rely on definitions that lack the essential properties of meaningful bias and variance. Recent research has shown that clean decompositions can be achieved for the broader class of Bregman divergences, with the cross-entropy loss as a special case. However, the necessary and sufficient conditions for these decompositions remain an open question.
  In this paper, we address this question by studying continuous, nonnegative loss functions that satisfy the identity of indiscernibles (zero loss if and only if the two arguments are identical), under mild regularity conditions. We prove that so-called $g$-Bregman divergences are the only such loss functions that have a clean bias-variance decomposition. A $g$-Bregman divergence can be transformed into a standard Bregman divergence through an invertible change of variables. This makes the squared Mahalanobis distance, up to such a variable transformation, the only symmetric loss function with a clean bias-variance decomposition. Consequently, common metrics such as $0$-$1$ and $L_1$ losses cannot admit a clean bias-variance decomposition, explaining why previous attempts have failed. We also examine the impact of relaxing the restrictions on the loss functions and how this affects our results.

Abstract: Rule-based models are essential for high-stakes decision-making due to their transparency and interpretability, but their discrete nature creates challenges for optimization and scalability. In this work, we present the Fuzzy Rule-based Reasoner (FRR), a novel gradient-based rule learning system that supports strict user constraints over rule-based complexity while achieving competitive performance. To maximize interpretability, the FRR uses semantically meaningful fuzzy logic partitions, unattainable with existing neuro-fuzzy approaches, and sufficient (single-rule) decision-making, which avoids the combinatorial complexity of additive rule ensembles. Through extensive evaluation across 40 datasets, FRR demonstrates: (1) superior performance to traditional rule-based methods (e.g., $5\%$ average accuracy over RIPPER); (2) comparable accuracy to tree-based models (e.g., CART) using rule bases $90\%$ more compact; and (3) achieves $96\%$ of the accuracy of state-of-the-art additive rule-based models while using only sufficient rules and requiring only $3\%$ of their rule base size.

Abstract: Among other uses, neural networks are a powerful tool for solving deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems in real-time, where variational autoencoders, a specialized type of neural network, enable the Bayesian estimation of model parameters and their distribution from observational data allowing real-time inverse uncertainty quantification. In this work, we build upon existing research [Goh, H. et al., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2022] by proposing a novel loss function to train variational autoencoders for Bayesian inverse problems. When the forward map is affine, we provide a theoretical proof of the convergence of the latent states of variational autoencoders to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We validate this theoretical result through numerical tests and we compare the proposed variational autoencoder with the existing one in the literature both in terms of accuracy and generalization properties. Finally, we test the proposed variational autoencoder on a Laplace equation, with comparison to the original one and Markov Chains Monte Carlo.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems is essential for ensuring reliability, safety, and efficiency in industrial and cyber-physical infrastructures. Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on two subsets (FD001, FD003) of the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan engine degradation. TDC-AE machtes LSTMs and outperforms Transformers while achieving a nearly 100x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.

Abstract: Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) mitigates the need for reward definition, aligning with human preferences via preference-driven reward feedback without interacting with the environment. However, trajectory-wise preference labels are difficult to meet the precise learning of step-wise reward, thereby affecting the performance of downstream algorithms. To alleviate the insufficient step-wise reward caused by trajectory-wise preferences, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). DPR directly treats step-wise preference-based reward acquisition as a binary classification and utilizes the robustness of diffusion classifiers to infer step-wise rewards discriminatively. In addition, to further utilize trajectory-wise preference information, we propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which conditions on trajectory-wise preference labels to enhance reward inference. We apply the above methods to existing offline RL algorithms, and a series of experimental results demonstrate that the diffusion classifier-driven reward outperforms the previous reward acquisition method with the Bradley-Terry model.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a set featuring 20 generic reaction templates written in SMARTS, a pattern-based notation designed to describe substructures and reactivity. Additionally, we introduce ProPreT5, a T5-based model specifically adapted for chemistry and, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of directly handling and applying SMARTS reaction templates. To further improve generalization, we propose the first augmentation strategy for SMARTS, which injects structural diversity at the pattern level. Trained on augmented templates, ProPreT5 demonstrates strong predictive performance and generalization to unseen reactions. Together, these contributions provide a novel and practical alternative to current methods, advancing the field of template-based reaction prediction.

Abstract: Alignment between human brain networks and artificial models has become an active research area in vision science and machine learning. A widely adopted approach is identifying "metamers," stimuli physically different yet perceptually equivalent within a system. However, conventional methods lack a direct approach to searching for the human metameric space. Instead, researchers first develop biologically inspired models and then infer about human metamers indirectly by testing whether model metamers also appear as metamers to humans. Here, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Metamer Exploration (MAME) framework, enabling direct, high-dimensional exploration of human metameric spaces through online image generation guided by human perceptual feedback. MAME modulates reference images across multiple dimensions based on hierarchical neural network responses, adaptively updating generation parameters according to participants' perceptual discriminability. Using MAME, we successfully measured multidimensional human metameric spaces within a single psychophysical experiment. Experimental results using a biologically plausible CNN model showed that human discrimination sensitivity was lower for metameric images based on low-level features compared to high-level features, which image contrast metrics could not explain. The finding suggests a relatively worse alignment between the metameric spaces of humans and the CNN model for low-level processing compared to high-level processing. Counterintuitively, given recent discussions on alignment at higher representational levels, our results highlight the importance of early visual computations in shaping biologically plausible models. Our MAME framework can serve as a future scientific tool for directly investigating the functional organization of human vision.

Abstract: Accurately predicting spatio-temporal network traffic is essential for dynamically managing computing resources in modern communication systems and minimizing energy consumption. Although spatio-temporal traffic prediction has received extensive research attention, further improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency remain necessary. In particular, existing decomposition-based methods or hybrid architectures often incur heavy overhead when capturing local and global feature correlations, necessitating novel approaches that optimize accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal network traffic prediction framework, DP-LET, which consists of a data processing module, a local feature enhancement module, and a Transformer-based prediction module. The data processing module is designed for high-efficiency denoising of network data and spatial decoupling. In contrast, the local feature enhancement module leverages multiple Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture fine-grained local features. Meanwhile, the prediction module utilizes a Transformer encoder to model long-term dependencies and assess feature relevance. A case study on real-world cellular traffic prediction demonstrates the practicality of DP-LET, which maintains low computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing MSE by 31.8% and MAE by 23.1% compared to baseline models.

Abstract: The advantage function is a central concept in RL that helps reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was proposed to compute the advantage for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all outputs in the group. However, it can lead to high variance when the reward advantage is inaccurately predicted. In this work, we propose Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (KRPO) model, by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically estimate the latent reward baseline and uncertainty. This filtering technique replaces the naive group mean, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization. Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models. Through the accuracies and rewards obtained from math question answering and reasoning, we show that using a more adaptive advantage estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO. The code is available at https://github.com/billhhh/KRPO_LLMs_RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.

Abstract: The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems - governed by partial differential equations - present unique challenges regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels. As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. We demonstrate significant gains in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better scaling to more complex dynamics. The accompanying code is available under https://github.com/FynnFromme/equivariant-rb-forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection. Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells' morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional. We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset. Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne}, enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. We further propose a training algorithm with single-sample bit-scale optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV) workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$ compared to the baseline dense model.

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms (on four out of six benchmarks). Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Highlighting its model-agnostic design, the method yielded valuable insights into both GT and MPNN backbones and appears well suited for broader DG applications beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained, score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Abstract: We propose a non-autoregressive framework for the Travelling Salesman Problem where solutions emerge directly from learned permutations, without requiring explicit search. By applying a similarity transformation to Hamiltonian cycles, the model learns to approximate permutation matrices via continuous relaxations. Our unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance against classical heuristics, demonstrating that the inherent structure of the problem can effectively guide combinatorial optimization without sequential decision-making. Our method offers concrete evidence that neural networks can directly capture and exploit combinatorial structure.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training. The source code is available at https://github.com/KlozeWang/LoSiA.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate candidate molecules' functional responses against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, which arises in modern applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees that the unique optimal transport map satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation and is the gradient of a convex function. In [arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps across both image morphing tasks and high-dimensional OT problems.

Abstract: Background and Aims: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities by learning from vast corpora of text and web data. Their semantic representations allow cross-task knowledge transfer and reasoning, offering promising opportunities for data-scarce and heterogeneous domains such as clinical medicine. Yet, in diagnostic tasks like sarcopenia, major challenges remain: interpretability, transparency, and deployment efficiency. Traditional machine learning (TML) models provide stable performance and feature-level attribution, ensuring traceable and auditable decision logic, but lack semantic breadth. Conversely, LLMs enable flexible inference but often function as opaque predictors. Existing integration strategies remain shallow, rarely embedding the structured reasoning of TML into LLM inference. Methods: Using sarcopenia diagnosis as a case study, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were extracted from a baseline XGBoost model and transformed into structured, LLM-compatible representations. An actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) strategy guided the LLM to reason over these SHAP-based inputs, producing calibrated rationales and refined decision rules. The distilled reasoning was consolidated into a structured knowledge repository and deployed via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for case-based inference. Results: (Omitted here.) Conclusion: By coupling SHAP-derived statistical evidence with reinforcement-trained LLM reasoning, CANDLE mitigates the interpretability-performance trade-off, enhances predictive accuracy, and preserves high decision consistency. The framework offers a scalable approach to knowledge assetization of TML models, enabling interpretable, reproducible, and clinically aligned decision support in sarcopenia and potentially broader medical domains.

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands adapters that are both parameter-efficient and expressive. We introduce \textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a hybrid adapter that combines Kronecker-structured factorization with low-rank LoRA compression-an integration that, to our knowledge, has not been explored in parameter-efficient fine-tuning or in matrix approximation literature. Kron-LoRA achieves up to 4$\times$ fewer parameters than standard LoRA while retaining similar expressivity. Experiments on DistilBERT, Mistral-7B, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-3-8B across eight benchmarks show that Kron-LoRA matches or exceeds LoRA baselines with modest memory savings and only a 5-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning, it also delivers competitive cross-task transfer despite using only one-quarter of the adapter parameters. Kron-LoRA thus offers a scalable, sustainable solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble (ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a changing climate.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Still, learning-based approaches to accelerate combinatorial optimization often require solving a large number of difficult instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational cost. Existing learning-based methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution, for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. We introduce Forge: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings, a framework that pre-trains a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large, diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised manner, without relying on optimization solvers or optimal solutions. Vector quantization produces discrete code assignments that serve as a vocabulary for representing optimization instances. We evaluate Forge in both unsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances across problem domains and sizes. In the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single pre-trained model helps predicting both the integrality gap for cut-generation and variable hints for search guidance across multiple problem and size distributions. In both tasks, we improve the performance of a commercial optimization solver and outperform state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Finally, we open-source our training code, pre-trained Forge weights, and embeddings for multiple MIP distributions to foster further research in representation learning for optimization problems.

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately. This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation (abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced, including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

Abstract: Brushing is a common interaction technique in 2D scatterplots, allowing users to select clustered points within a continuous, enclosed region for further analysis or filtering. However, applying conventional brushing to 2D representations of multidimensional (MD) data, i.e., Multidimensional Projections (MDPs), can lead to unreliable cluster analysis due to MDP-induced distortions that inaccurately represent the cluster structure of the original MD data. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel brushing technique for MDPs called Distortion-aware brushing. As users perform brushing, Distortion-aware brushing corrects distortions around the currently brushed points by dynamically relocating points in the projection, pulling data points close to the brushed points in MD space while pushing distant ones apart. This dynamic adjustment helps users brush MD clusters more accurately, leading to more reliable cluster analysis. Our user studies with 24 participants show that Distortion-aware brushing significantly outperforms previous brushing techniques for MDPs in accurately separating clusters in the MD space and remains robust against distortions. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through two use cases: (1) conducting cluster analysis of geospatial data and (2) interactively labeling MD clusters.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms protect individual-level information by introducing randomness into the statistical analysis procedure. Despite the availability of numerous DP tools, there remains a lack of general techniques for conducting statistical inference under DP. We examine a DP bootstrap procedure that releases multiple private bootstrap estimates to infer the sampling distribution and construct confidence intervals (CIs). Our privacy analysis presents new results on the privacy cost of a single DP bootstrap estimate, applicable to any DP mechanism, and identifies some misapplications of the bootstrap in the existing literature. For the composition of the DP bootstrap, we present a numerical method to compute the exact privacy cost of releasing multiple DP bootstrap estimates, and using the Gaussian-DP (GDP) framework (Dong et al., 2022), we show that the release of $B$ DP bootstrap estimates from mechanisms satisfying $(\mu/\sqrt{(2-2/\mathrm{e})B})$-GDP asymptotically satisfies $\mu$-GDP as $B$ goes to infinity. Then, we perform private statistical inference by post-processing the DP bootstrap estimates. We prove that our point estimates are consistent, our standard CIs are asymptotically valid, and both enjoy optimal convergence rates. To further improve the finite performance, we use deconvolution with DP bootstrap estimates to accurately infer the sampling distribution. We derive CIs for tasks such as population mean estimation, logistic regression, and quantile regression, and we compare them to existing methods using simulations and real-world experiments on 2016 Canada Census data. Our private CIs achieve the nominal coverage level and offer the first approach to private inference for quantile regression.

Abstract: Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as one of the optimal solutions for node-level and supervised tasks. However, for structure-related and unsupervised tasks such as graph clustering, current GCL algorithms face difficulties acquiring the necessary cluster-level information, resulting in poor performance. In addition, general unsupervised GCL improves the performance of downstream tasks by increasing the number of negative samples, which leads to severe class collision and unfairness of graph clustering. To address the above issues, we propose a Cluster-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Framework (CueGCL) to jointly learn clustering results and node representations. Specifically, we design a personalized self-training (PeST) strategy for unsupervised scenarios, which enables our model to capture precise cluster-level personalized information. With the benefit of the PeST, we alleviate class collision and unfairness without sacrificing the overall model performance. Furthermore, aligned graph clustering (AGC) is employed to obtain the cluster partition, where we align the clustering space of our downstream task with that in PeST to achieve more consistent node embeddings. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing it yields an embedding space with a significantly discernible cluster structure. Extensive experimental results also show our CueGCL exhibits state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets with different scales.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.

Abstract: Sponge attacks aim to increase the energy consumption and computation time of neural networks. In this work, we present a novel sponge attack called SkipSponge. SkipSponge is the first sponge attack that is performed directly on the parameters of a pretrained model using only a few data samples. Our experiments show that SkipSponge can successfully increase the energy consumption of image classification models, GANs, and autoencoders, requiring fewer samples than the state-of-the-art sponge attacks (Sponge Poisoning). We show that poisoning defenses are ineffective if not adjusted specifically for the defense against SkipSponge (i.e., they decrease target layer bias values) and that SkipSponge is more effective on the GANs and the autoencoders than Sponge Poisoning. Additionally, SkipSponge is stealthy as it does not require significant changes to the victim model's parameters. Our experiments indicate that SkipSponge can be performed even when an attacker has access to less than 1% of the entire training dataset and reaches up to 13% energy increase.

We also show how the analysis can be extended to fine-tuning with a general $f$-divergence regularizer. Numerical experiments on large-scale text-to-image models--Stable Diffusion v1.5 are conducted to validate our approach.

Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work. Our code and models are publicly released at https://jykoh.com/search-agents.

Abstract: Clustering is a well-studied unsupervised learning task that aims to partition data points into a number of clusters. In many applications, these clusters correspond to real-world constructs (e.g., electoral districts, playlists, TV channels), where a group (e.g., social or demographic) benefits only if it reaches a minimum level of representation in the cluster (e.g., 50% to elect their preferred candidate). In this paper, we study the k-means and k-medians clustering problems under the additional fairness constraint that each group must attain a minimum level of representation in at least a specified number of clusters. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer (nonlinear) optimization problem and propose an alternating minimization algorithm, called MiniReL, to solve it. Although incorporating fairness constraints results in an NP-hard assignment problem within the MiniReL algorithm, we present several heuristic strategies that make the approach practical even for large datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that our method yields fair clusters without increasing clustering cost across standard benchmark datasets.

<title>UNComp: Can Matrix Entropy Uncover Sparsity? -- A Compressor Design from an Uncertainty-Aware Perspective</title>

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference remains challenging due to their substantial memory and computational demands. While techniques such as Key-Value (KV) cache compression are designed to reduce memory usage, they often neglect the structured sparsity inherent in the relationship between hidden states and their corresponding KV cache. In this work, we explore the role of uncertainty as a potential indicator of sparsity within LLMs. We propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware framework that leverages truncated matrix entropy to identify areas of low information content, thereby revealing sparsity patterns that can be used for adaptive compression. Unlike traditional methods that apply uniform compression, UNComp dynamically adjusts its approach to compression, guided by uncertainty measures that reflect the importance of various model components. Our analysis shows that sparsity patterns, when derived from uncertainty estimates, can be exploited to reveal special long-range dependencies, such as retrieval heads and retrieval layers. This perspective not only enhances our understanding of how compression can be optimized but also provides new insights into the inherent sparsity of LLMs during long-context inference. By focusing on uncertainty to analyze the sparsity pattern in detail, UNComp reduces the KV cache size to 4.74% of the original, achieves a 6% prefill speedup, and improves throughput by 6.4x - not only delivering strong lossless compression performance, but also validating the effectiveness of the underlying theoretical tool. We release the code at https://github.com/menik1126/UNComp.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently been adopted in robotics for their capability in common sense reasoning and generalizability. Existing work has applied VLMs to generate task and motion planning from natural language instructions and simulate training data for robot learning. In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.

Abstract: We revisit continual learning~(CL), which enables pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) to sequentially fine-tune on new downstream tasks over time. However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a more serious challenge. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. Additionally, we propose a scheme to predict task identity with confidence and calibrate the model's outputs accordingly. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and computation efficiency in training over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents Sparse Gradient Descent as a solution for variable selection in convex piecewise linear regression, where the model is given as the maximum of $k$-affine functions $ x \mapsto \max_{j \in [k]} \langle a_j^\star, x \rangle + b_j^\star$ for $j = 1,\dots,k$. Here, $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ and $\{b_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ denote the ground-truth weight vectors and intercepts. A non-asymptotic local convergence analysis is provided for Sp-GD under sub-Gaussian noise when the covariate distribution satisfies the sub-Gaussianity and anti-concentration properties. When the model order and parameters are fixed, Sp-GD provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\max(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_z^2,1)s\log(d/s))$ observations where $\sigma_z^2$ denotes the noise variance. This also implies the exact parameter recovery by Sp-GD from $\mathcal{O}(s\log(d/s))$ noise-free observations. The proposed initialization scheme uses sparse principal component analysis to estimate the subspace spanned by $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$, then applies an $r$-covering search to estimate the model parameters. A non-asymptotic analysis is presented for this initialization scheme when the covariates and noise samples follow Gaussian distributions. When the model order and parameters are fixed, this initialization scheme provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\max(\sigma_z^4,\sigma_z^2,1)s^2\log^4(d))$ observations. A new transformation named Real Maslov Dequantization (RMD) is proposed to transform sparse generalized polynomials into sparse max-affine models. The error decay rate of RMD is shown to be exponentially small in its temperature parameter. Furthermore, theoretical guarantees for Sp-GD are extended to the bounded noise model induced by RMD. Numerical Monte Carlo results corroborate theoretical findings for Sp-GD and the initialization scheme.

Abstract: Music style transfer enables personalized music creation by blending the structure of a source with the stylistic attributes of a reference. Existing text-conditioned and diffusion-based approaches show promise but often require paired datasets, extensive training, or detailed annotations. We present Stylus, a training-free framework that repurposes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for music style transfer in the mel-spectrogram domain. Stylus manipulates self-attention by injecting style key-value features while preserving source queries to maintain musical structure. To improve fidelity, we introduce a phase-preserving reconstruction strategy that avoids artifacts from Griffin-Lim reconstruction, and we adopt classifier-free-guidance-inspired control for adjustable stylization and multi-style blending. In extensive evaluations, Stylus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 34.1% higher content preservation and 25.7% better perceptual quality without any additional training.

arXiv:2411.19860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present SpaRC, a novel Sparse fusion transformer for 3D perception that integrates multi-view image semantics with Radar and Camera point features. The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/phi-wol/sparc.

Abstract: In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a semantic understanding of an unseen environment to answer a situated question with confidence. This problem remains challenging in robotics, due to the difficulties in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online, and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient planning and exploration. To address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantics-guided exploration. We evaluate GraphEQA in simulation on two benchmark datasets, HM-EQA and OpenEQA, and demonstrate that it outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps. We further demonstrate GraphEQA in multiple real-world home and office environments.

Abstract: Circular and non-flat data distributions are prevalent across diverse domains of data science, yet their specific geometric structures often remain underutilized in machine learning frameworks. A principled approach to accounting for the underlying geometry of such data is pivotal, particularly when extending statistical models, like the pervasive Gaussian distribution. In this work, we tackle those issue by focusing on the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, a key focus in information geometry. We introduce a non-isotropic wrapped Gaussian by leveraging the exponential map, we derive theoretical properties of this distribution and propose a maximum likelihood framework for parameter estimation. Furthermore, we reinterpret established classifiers on SPD through a probabilistic lens and introduce new classifiers based on the wrapped Gaussian model. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of this geometry-aware distribution, underscoring its potential to advance manifold-based data analysis. This work lays the groundwork for extending classical machine learning and statistical methods to more complex and structured data.

Abstract: Two-sample hypothesis testing-determining whether two sets of data are drawn from the same distribution-is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning with broad scientific applications. In the context of nonparametric testing, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has gained popularity as a test statistic due to its flexibility and strong theoretical foundations. However, its use in large-scale scenarios is plagued by high computational costs. In this work, we use a Nystr\"om approximation of the MMD to design a computationally efficient and practical testing algorithm while preserving statistical guarantees. Our main result is a finite-sample bound on the power of the proposed test for distributions that are sufficiently separated with respect to the MMD. The derived separation rate matches the known minimax optimal rate in this setting. We support our findings with a series of numerical experiments, emphasizing applicability to realistic scientific data.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for training autonomous vehicles (AV) to navigate complex traffic environments by mimicking expert driver behaviors. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we study a data augmentation strategy that leverages the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured by the AV's sensors, as additional demonstrations. We introduce a simple vehicle-selection sampling and filtering strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer dataset for training. We evaluate this idea with a representative learning-based planner on a large real-world dataset and demonstrate improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, the approach reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10 percent of the original dataset, the method matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset. Through ablations, we analyze selection criteria and show that naive random selection can degrade performance. Our findings highlight the value of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.

Abstract: Visual grounding focuses on detecting objects from images based on language expressions. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced visual grounding performance by training large models with large-scale datasets. However, the problem remains challenging, especially when similar objects appear in the input image. For example, an LVLM may not be able to differentiate Diet Coke and regular Coke in an image. In this case, if additional reference images of Diet Coke and regular Coke are available, it can help the visual grounding of similar objects.
  In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding (MRVG). In this task, a model has access to a set of reference images of objects in a database. Based on these reference images and a language expression, the model is required to detect a target object from a query image. We first introduce a new dataset to study the MRVG problem. Then we introduce a novel method, named MRVG-Net, to solve this visual grounding problem. We show that by efficiently using reference images with few-shot object detection and using Large Language Models (LLMs) for object matching, our method achieves superior visual grounding performance compared to the state-of-the-art LVLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Our approach bridges the gap between few-shot detection and visual grounding, unlocking new capabilities for visual understanding, which has wide applications in robotics.

Abstract: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.

<title>Small or Large? Zero-Shot or Finetuned? Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled classical safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to generalize to complex robotic systems operating directly from high-dimensional sensor observations. However, obtaining comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical scenarios during world model training is extremely challenging. As a result, latent safety filters built on top of these models may miss novel hazards and even fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently misclassifying risky out-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this, we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from both known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model's epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We propose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented state space-spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty-we synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes safe, in-distribution actions.

Abstract: A key value proposition of machine learning is generalizability: the same methods and model architecture should be able to work across different domains and different contexts. While powerful, this generalization can sometimes go too far, and miss the importance of the specifics. In this work, we look at how fair machine learning has often treated as interchangeable the identity axis along which discrimination occurs. In other words, racism is measured and mitigated the same way as sexism, as ableism, as ageism. Disciplines outside of computer science have pointed out both the similarities and differences between these different forms of oppression, and in this work we draw out the implications for fair machine learning. While certainly not all aspects of fair machine learning need to be tailored to the specific form of oppression, there is a pressing need for greater attention to such specificity than is currently evident. Ultimately, context specificity can deepen our understanding of how to build more fair systems, widen our scope to include currently overlooked harms, and, almost paradoxically, also help to narrow our scope and counter the fear of an infinite number of group-specific methods of analysis.

Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.

Abstract: The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While final statuses are hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide useful representations of the underlying diffusion process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. Through extensive benchmarking against Approximate Bayesian Computation and GNN-based baselines, our framework consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering accurate parameter estimates across diverse diffusion settings while scaling efficiently to large networks. We validate the method on synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible.

<title>DISCO Balances the Scales: Adaptive Domain- and Difficulty-Aware Reinforcement Learning on Imbalanced Data</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups, assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Tonyzhou98/disco_grpo.

<title>Emergent Risk Awareness in Rational Agents under Resource Constraints</title>

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/TrustVLM.

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight training framework that significantly improves detail and texture fidelity in ultra-high-resolution (2K-4K) image synthesis. LWD introduces a novel, frequency-aware masking strategy derived from wavelet energy maps, which dynamically focuses the training process on detail-rich regions of the latent space. This is complemented by a scale-consistent VAE objective to ensure high spectral fidelity. The primary advantage of our approach is its efficiency: LWD requires no architectural modifications and adds zero additional cost during inference, making it a practical solution for scaling existing models. Across multiple strong baselines, LWD consistently improves perceptual quality and FID scores, demonstrating the power of signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient path toward high-resolution generative modeling.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore, hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the post-training of generalist robot policies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning, most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU). CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined (removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft, and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum increase in average accuracy across 1.03%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Abstract: Identifying useful sorbent materials for direct air capture (DAC) from humid air remains a challenge. We present the Open DAC 2025 (ODAC25) dataset, a significant expansion and improvement upon ODAC23 (Sriram et al., ACS Central Science, 10 (2024) 923), comprising nearly 60 million DFT single-point calculations for CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and O$_2$ adsorption in 15,000 MOFs. ODAC25 introduces chemical and configurational diversity through functionalized MOFs, high-energy GCMC-derived placements, and synthetically generated frameworks. ODAC25 also significantly improves upon the accuracy of DFT calculations and the treatment of flexible MOFs in ODAC23. Along with the dataset, we release new state-of-the-art machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ODAC25 and evaluate them on adsorption energy and Henry's law coefficient predictions.

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables, created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation, and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.

arXiv:2509.14461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum agnostic learning of phase states with respect to a function class $\mathsf{C}\subseteq \{c:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}\}$: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\textsf{opt}$ with a phase state $|\phi_c\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{x\in \{0,1\}^n}(-1)^{c(x)}|x\rangle$ for some $c\in \mathsf{C}$, output $|\phi\rangle$ which has fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \textsf{opt}-\varepsilon$. To this end, we give agnostic learning protocols for the following classes: (i) Size-$t$ decision trees which runs in time $\textsf{poly}(n,t,1/\varepsilon)$. This also implies $k$-juntas can be agnostically learned in time $\textsf{poly}(n,2^k,1/\varepsilon)$. (ii) $s$-term DNF formulas in time $\textsf{poly}(n,(s/\varepsilon)^{\log \log (s/\varepsilon) \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)})$.
  Our main technical contribution is a quantum agnostic boosting protocol which converts a weak agnostic learner, which outputs a parity state $|\phi\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt}/\textsf{poly}(n)$, into a strong learner which outputs a superposition of parity states $|\phi'\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi'|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt} - \varepsilon$.
  Using quantum agnostic boosting, we obtain a $n^{O(\log \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))}$-time algorithm for learning $\textsf{poly}(n)$-sized depth-$3$ circuits (consisting of $\textsf{AND}$, $\textsf{OR}$, $\textsf{NOT}$ gates) in the uniform $\textsf{PAC}$ model given quantum examples, which is near-polynomial time for constant $\varepsilon$. Classically, obtaining an algorithm with a similar complexity has been an open question in the $\textsf{PAC}$ model and our work answers this given quantum examples.

Summary:
The study introduces the Straight Consistent Trajectory (SCoT) model, which combines the advantages of the consistency model and the rectified flow method for efficient sampling in pre-trained diffusion models. SCoT maintains both consistent and straight trajectories by focusing on regulating gradient mapping and ensuring trajectory consistency. The model aims to improve sampling efficiency by accelerating the generation of clean images from random noises using advanced trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SCoT in producing consistent and straight trajectories while achieving faster sampling speeds. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by balancing the dual properties of trajectory consistency and straightness, providing a more efficient and reliable sampling framework for pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.

Abstract: Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed natural language understanding and generation, but they raise privacy concerns due to potential exposure of sensitive information. Studies have highlighted the risk of information leakage, where adversaries can extract sensitive information embedded in the prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel private prediction framework for generating high-quality synthetic text with strong privacy guarantees. Our approach leverages the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to ensure worst-case theoretical bounds on information leakage without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying models. The proposed method performs inference on private records and aggregates the resulting per-token output distributions. This enables the generation of longer and coherent synthetic text while maintaining privacy guarantees. Additionally, we propose a simple blending operation that combines private and public inference to further enhance utility. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, making it a promising direction for privacy-preserving text generation while maintaining high utility.

<div> intersectional fairness, machine learning, fairness-aware optimization, adaptive optimization, disparate impact

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Adaptive Pareto Front Explorer (APFEx), a framework that addresses fairness in machine learning models by explicitly considering intersectional biases across multiple protected attributes. APFEx utilizes an adaptive multi-objective optimizer to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, includes differentiable intersectional fairness metrics for optimizing non-smooth subgroup disparities, and guarantees convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that APFEx outperforms existing methods by reducing fairness violations while maintaining competitive accuracy. This approach bridges a critical gap in fair ML by offering a scalable, model-agnostic solution for intersectional fairness. <div>

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, especially when biases compound across intersecting protected attributes like race, gender, and age. While existing methods address fairness for single attributes, they fail to capture the nuanced, multiplicative biases faced by intersectional subgroups. We introduce Adaptive Pareto Front Explorer (APFEx), the first framework to explicitly model intersectional fairness as a joint optimization problem over the Cartesian product of sensitive attributes. APFEx combines three key innovations- (1) an adaptive multi-objective optimizer that dynamically switches between Pareto cone projection, gradient weighting, and exploration strategies to navigate fairness-accuracy trade-offs, (2) differentiable intersectional fairness metrics enabling gradient-based optimization of non-smooth subgroup disparities, and (3) theoretical guarantees of convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate APFEx's superiority, reducing fairness violations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work bridges a critical gap in fair ML, providing a scalable, model-agnostic solution for intersectional fairness.

<div> Hierarchical Federated Learning, Social Network with Mobility, Resource Allocation, Client Scheduling, Energy Consumption <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach called HFL-SNM for Federated Learning that considers both data sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. The framework addresses the issue of data privacy and client mobility often neglected in conventional FL frameworks. By formulating a joint optimization problem of resource allocation and client scheduling, the objective is to minimize energy consumption during the FL process. The concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate in the social network are introduced to analyze their impact on model performance. The proposed DO-SNM algorithm decouples the optimization problem into sub-problems and achieves superior model performance while reducing energy consumption compared to baseline algorithms. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach in improving model performance and energy efficiency in FL scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that allows collaborative local model training and global aggregation, thereby protecting data privacy. In conventional FL frameworks, data privacy is typically preserved under the assumption that local data remains absolutely private, whereas the mobility of clients is frequently neglected in explicit modeling. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical federated learning framework based on the social network with mobility namely HFL-SNM that considers both data sharing among clients and their mobility patterns. Under the constraints of limited resources, we formulate a joint optimization problem of resource allocation and client scheduling, which objective is to minimize the energy consumption of clients during the FL process. In social network, we introduce the concepts of Effective Data Coverage Rate and Redundant Data Coverage Rate. We analyze the impact of effective data and redundant data on the model performance through preliminary experiments. We decouple the optimization problem into multiple sub-problems, analyze them based on preliminary experimental results, and propose Dynamic Optimization in Social Network with Mobility (DO-SNM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior model performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to traditional baseline algorithms.

Summary: 
- Research shows that prime number distribution has deterministic and statistical characteristics.
- Image-focused machine learning models can measure regularity of prime number fields on Ulam spirals.
- Models trained on regions near 500m show higher accuracy than those near 25m.
- Precision and recall scores suggest different classification approaches in different regions of the spiral.
- Machine learning could serve as an experimental tool for number theory and investigating strong and weak prime patterns for cryptographic purposes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character: deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages (density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential 1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic purposes.

<div> Estimator, Federated Learning, Data Valuation, Wasserstein Distance, Model Performance

Summary: 
This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for Federated Learning (FL) in data marketplaces, addressing challenges in data valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources. The framework utilizes a Wasserstein-based estimator to predict model performance across unseen data combinations and assess compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. A distributed method for approximating Wasserstein distance ensures privacy without requiring access to raw data. The framework leverages the neural scaling law to reliably extrapolate model performance, enabling efficient data selection without full-scale training. Experimental results across various scenarios demonstrate the approach's ability to identify high-performing data combinations, contributing to the development of more reliable FL-based model marketplaces. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketplaces have become essential platforms for facilitating the exchange of data products to foster data sharing. Model transactions provide economic solutions in data marketplaces that enhance data reusability and ensure the traceability of data ownership. To establish trustworthy data marketplaces, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable collaborative learning across siloed datasets while safeguarding data privacy. However, effective data valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources in the FL setup remain key challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a Wasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts model performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To ensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein distance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that model performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law, enabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and unlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies high-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based model marketplaces.

Summary:
- The study investigates learning continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic demand to understand the impact of structure on forecasting the bullwhip effect.
- Two models, Neural ODE (NODE) and Universal Differential Equation (UDE), are compared to evaluate the forecasting performance under different demand regimes.
- UDE, which incorporates conservation and order-up-to structure, outperforms NODE in structured demand regimes, showing better generalization.
- NODE exhibits flexibility in extreme events, performing better under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks.
- The results suggest enforcing structure in light-tailed or correlated noise scenarios and relaxing structure in settings with extreme events dominating. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study learning of continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic demand and quantify when structure helps or hurts forecasting of the bullwhip effect. BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the entire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential Equation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while learning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain the bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while recent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain constraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias helps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by using a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1) (autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done on varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step forecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured regimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon, inventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96 to 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the flexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data shrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains stable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance: enforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax structure when extreme events dominate. Beyond inventory control, the results offer guidance for hybrid modeling in scientific and engineering systems: enforce known structure when conservation laws and modest noise dominate, and relax structure to capture extremes in settings where rare events drive dynamics.

Abstract: The growing use of permanent monitoring systems has increased data availability, offering new opportunities for structural assessment but also posing scalability challenges, especially across large bridge networks. Managing multiple structures requires tracking and comparing long-term behaviour efficiently. To address this, knowledge transfer between similar structures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer learning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model trained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics. These models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and generalizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data from two bridges. The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian inference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features from monitoring data. Results showed high sensitivity to damage location, severity, and extent. This approach enhances real-time monitoring and enables cross-structure knowledge transfer, promoting smart monitoring strategies and improved resilience at the network level.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers (AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
- Accurate recognition of vessel types from AIS data is crucial for safety and combatting IUU activity.

- The pipeline involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training with tree-based algorithms.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of vessel types from Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracks is essential for safety oversight and combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activity. This paper presents a strait-scale, machine-learning pipeline that classifies moving vessels using only AIS data. We analyze eight days of historical AIS from the Danish Maritime Authority covering the Bornholm Strait in the Baltic Sea (January 22-30, 2025). After forward/backward filling voyage records, removing kinematic and geospatial outliers, and segmenting per-MMSI tracks while excluding stationary periods ($\ge 1$ h), we derive 31 trajectory-level features spanning kinematics (e.g., SOG statistics), temporal, geospatial (Haversine distances, spans), and ship-shape attributes computed from AIS A/B/C/D reference points (length, width, aspect ratio, bridge-position ratio). To avoid leakage, we perform grouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing; N=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest with SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall 92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches one-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897. Feature-importance analysis highlights the bridge-position ratio and maximum SOG as the most discriminative signals; principal errors occur between cargo and tanker, reflecting similar transit behavior. We demonstrate operational value by backfilling missing ship types on unseen data and discuss improvements such as DBSCAN based trip segmentation and gradient-boosted ensembles to handle frequent-stop ferries and further lift performance. The results show that lightweight features over AIS trajectories enable real-time vessel type classification in straits.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a patch-based PCA-Net framework for efficiently solving partial differential equations using neural operator learning. By decomposing solution fields into smaller patches and applying PCA within each patch, computational overhead is significantly reduced. Two patch-based approaches, local-to-global and local-to-local patch PCA, are explored to balance efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. The study analyzes the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy and highlights the advantages and limitations of each approach. Additionally, refinements such as introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and employing a two-step process using a convolutional neural network are investigated for further efficiency improvements. Results demonstrate that patch-based PCA reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, leading to a 3.7 to 4 times reduction in processing time compared to global PCA. This approach shows promise for efficient operator learning in PDE-based systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However, applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1) local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach, we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i) introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based systems.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel context optimization (CoOp) framework for improving out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in artificial intelligence systems, specifically large-scale vision-language models. The framework combines subspace representation learning with prompt tuning to enhance the discriminative potential of feature embeddings. By projecting in-distribution (ID) features into a subspace defined by prompt vectors and filtering out ID-irrelevant features, the framework boosts ID-OOD separability. An end-to-end learning criterion is developed to ensure both strong OOD detection performance and high ID classification accuracy. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in improving the reliability of AI systems in open-world settings. <div>
arXiv:2509.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring (EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over 500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches, offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for future clinical AI development in prenatal care.

Abstract: Autoregressive inference in large transformer-based language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for runtime efficiency, particularly during the decode phase where load imbalance across GPU shards can cause throughput degradation and latency spikes. A DPU-assisted framework leveraged by BlueField-3 Data Processing Units can enable real-time detection and mitigation of load imbalance in multi-node tensor-parallel inference. By offloading monitoring tasks to the DPU and analyzing GPU telemetry and inter-node communication patterns, the resulting system can provide actionable feedback to inference controllers and schedulers. The goal of this study is three-fold i) identify the reported skews/imbalances/pathological conditions that arise in muti-GPU execution of a) LLM tensor computing (both during training and inference), b) identify their impact on computational performance, and c) make a critical assessment if those can be tracked for potential mitigation from a DPU network.

<div> Keywords: Spatial Balance Attention, spatiotemporal forecasting, spatial correlation, multiscale model, real-world datasets

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for spatiotemporal forecasting, aiming to strike a balance between spatial proximity and global correlation. By partitioning the spatial graph into subgraphs and employing Intra-subgraph Attention for local spatial correlation, combined with Inter-subgraph Attention for global spatial correlation, the proposed model facilitates message passing among subgraphs. This approach enables the development of a scalable multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model, enhancing structured spatial correlation while maintaining implementation simplicity. Evaluation on medium to large real-world datasets demonstrates performance improvements of up to 7.7% over baseline methods, achieved at low running costs. The model's efficacy and efficiency signify its potential for enhancing forecasting accuracy in complex spatiotemporal scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for spatiotemporal forecasting. To strike a balance between obeying spatial proximity and capturing global correlation, we partition the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiate Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph; to capture the global spatial correlation, we further aggregate the nodes to produce subgraph representations and achieve message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention. Building on the proposed Spatial Balance Attention block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively increasing the subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. We evaluate its efficacy and efficiency against the existing models on real-world spatiotemporal datasets from medium to large sizes. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 7.7% over the baseline methods at low running costs.

<div> Latent Space Optimization, Test-time Optimization, Iterative Methods, Amortized Latent Steering, Inference Efficiency <br />
Summary: <br />
Test-time optimization methods are often computationally expensive, hindering their scalability. Traditional approaches like iterative refinement and multi-step verification require significantly more compute power per query. Amortized Latent Steering (ALS) offers a novel solution by collapsing the iterative optimization process into a single vector computed offline and applied during inference at a constant cost. By calibrating the model's hidden representations based on successful versus unsuccessful generations, ALS achieves a 2-5x speedup compared to iterative methods while matching or surpassing other baselines. This approach, demonstrated on benchmark datasets like GSM8K and MATH-500, showcases the potential of leveraging offline computation to enhance model efficiency without compromising accuracy. As a result, sophisticated reasoning techniques become more practical for real-world deployment. <div>

Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive inference costs\textemdash techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step verification can require $10$--$100\times$ more compute per query than standard decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and MATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\times$ speedup over iterative methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\% improvement in efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning techniques viable for production deployment.

<div> machine learning, IoT devices, Federated Learning, RISC-V, L-SGD

Summary:<br /><br />The article discusses the challenges of on-device training for IoT devices due to the lack of GPUs and accelerators, leading to dependency on cloud-based services. Federated Learning is proposed as a solution for decentralized training directly on devices, but efficient optimization algorithms are needed. L-SGD, a variant of stochastic gradient descent, enables neural network training on Arm Cortex-M MCUs and has now been extended to RISC-V MCUs. Evaluation on both platforms shows the impact of the absence of FPUs in RISC-V MCUs. To address this, an 8-bit quantized version of L-SGD for RISC-V is introduced, achieving reduced memory usage and faster training time with minimal accuracy loss. <div>

Abstract: Modern IoT devices increasingly rely on machine learning solutions to process data locally. However, the lack of graphics processing units (GPUs) or dedicated accelerators on most platforms makes on-device training largely infeasible, often requiring cloud-based services to perform this task. This procedure often raises privacy-related concerns, and creates dependency on reliable and always-on connectivity. Federated Learning (FL) is a new trend that addresses these issues by enabling decentralized and collaborative training directly on devices, but it requires highly efficient optimization algorithms. L-SGD, a lightweight variant of stochastic gradient descent, has enabled neural network training on Arm Cortex-M Microcontroller Units (MCUs). This work extends L-SGD to RISC-V-based MCUs, an open and emerging architecture that still lacks robust support for on-device training. L-SGD was evaluated on both Arm and RISC-V platforms using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, highlighting the performance impact of the absence of Floating-Point Units (FPUs) in RISC-V MCUs. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce an 8-bit quantized version of L-SGD for RISC-V, which achieves nearly 4x reduction in memory usage and a 2.2x speedup in training time, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However, developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic reinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO) algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties. We introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both AndroidWorld (75.8%) and AndroidLab (46.8%). The MOBILERL framework is adopted in the AutoGLM products, and also open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/MobileRL.

Summary: 
The paper introduces CoCoGen, a framework that addresses the challenges of cross-silo federated learning in heterogeneous and competitive settings. It leverages generative AI and potential game theory to optimize collaborative learning while considering both statistical heterogeneity and economic competition among organizations. CoCoGen models competition and statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility formulations, treating each training round as a weighted potential game. The framework derives data generation strategies using GenAI that maximize social welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset demonstrate the impact of varying heterogeneity and competition levels on organizational behavior and show that CoCoGen outperforms baseline methods consistently. Overall, CoCoGen offers a solution for organizations to collaborate on AI model training while navigating competition and safeguarding data privacy. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals, making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model, analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face increasing pressure to allocate limited nursing resources efficiently while accounting for skill heterogeneity, patient acuity, staff fatigue, and continuity of care. Traditional optimization and heuristic scheduling methods struggle to capture these dynamic, multi-constraint environments. I propose NurseSchedRL, a reinforcement learning framework for nurse-patient assignment that integrates structured state encoding, constrained action masking, and attention-based representations of skills, fatigue, and geographical context. NurseSchedRL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with feasibility masks to ensure assignments respect real-world constraints, while dynamically adapting to patient arrivals and varying nurse availability. In simulation with realistic nurse and patient data, NurseSchedRL achieves improved scheduling efficiency, better alignment of skills to patient needs, and reduced fatigue compared to baseline heuristic and unconstrained RL approaches. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for decision support in complex, high-stakes healthcare workforce management.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized training framework widely used in IoT ecosystems that preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, making it ideal for IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with sensing and communication like Smart Grids (SGs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust, privacy-preserving EVCS security.

The paper introduces a new framework called Safe-SAIL that aims to interpret Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) within Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance safety analysis. This is important as the deployment of LLMs in real-world applications raises safety concerns. The research focuses on providing a mechanistic understanding of safety-related behaviors by explaining single-meaning atomic features extracted from SAEs. The framework systematically identifies SAEs with the best concept-specific interpretability and explains safety-related neurons. It introduces efficient strategies to scale up the interpretation process and offers a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron explanations. This framework facilitates empirical analysis of safety risks in LLMs and aims to advance research in the field of LLM safety. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu- lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

Summary:<br />
Machine learning surrogates are being used to replace expensive computational models for reliability analysis. However, the approximation errors in these models introduce uncertainty that can affect the accuracy of predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite quadrature approach to separate and analyze both aleatory uncertainty from model inputs and epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors. By evaluating conditional failure probabilities and integrating them across uncertainties, this method provides more accurate reliability predictions. Three examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing that it maintains computational efficiency while producing reliable results compared to traditional methods that overlook model uncertainty. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly employed to replace expensive computational models for physics-based reliability analysis. However, their use introduces epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors, which couples with aleatory uncertainty in model inputs, potentially compromising the accuracy of reliability predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite quadrature approach to decouple these nested uncertainties and enable more accurate reliability analysis. The method evaluates conditional failure probabilities under aleatory uncertainty using First and Second Order Reliability Methods and then integrates these probabilities across realizations of epistemic uncertainty. Three examples demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains computational efficiency while yielding more trustworthy predictions than traditional methods that ignore model uncertainty.

<div> Keywords: metro intelligent transportation system, transfer passenger flow prediction, STL method, GRU, deep learning

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel model for predicting transfer passenger flow in metro intelligent transportation systems. By integrating the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method with the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), the model improves prediction accuracy significantly. Using the Keras deep learning library, the model processes metro card swiping data, identifies passenger travel paths, and constructs transfer passenger flow time series. It then applies the STL algorithm to decompose the time series into trend, periodic, and residual components, filtering outliers and completing predictions. Validation on a metro station's transfer passenger flow data shows that the STL-GRU model outperforms LSTM, GRU, and the combined STL-LSTM model, reducing mean absolute percentage error by at least 2.3, 1.36, and 6.42 percentage points on weekdays (excluding Fridays), Fridays, and rest days, respectively. <div>

Abstract: In the metro intelligent transportation system, accurate transfer passenger flow prediction is a key link in optimizing operation plans and improving transportation efficiency. To further improve the theory of metro internal transfer passenger flow prediction and provide more reliable support for intelligent operation decisions, this paper innovatively proposes a metro transfer passenger flow prediction model that integrates the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).In practical application, the model first relies on the deep learning library Keras to complete the construction and training of the GRU model, laying the foundation for subsequent prediction; then preprocesses the original metro card swiping data, uses the graph-based depth-first search algorithm to identify passengers' travel paths, and further constructs the transfer passenger flow time series; subsequently adopts the STL time series decomposition algorithm to decompose the constructed transfer passenger flow time series into trend component, periodic component and residual component, and uses the 3{\sigma} principle to eliminate and fill the outliers in the residual component, and finally completes the transfer passenger flow prediction.Taking the transfer passenger flow data of a certain metro station as the research sample, the validity of the model is verified. The results show that compared with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the combined model of STL time series decomposition method and Long Short-Term Memory (STL-LSTM), the STL-GRU combined prediction model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of transfer passenger flow on weekdays (excluding Fridays), Fridays and rest days, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the prediction results reduced by at least 2.3, 1.36 and 6.42 percentage points respectively.

Summary: The research delves into the weight matrices of machine learning applications in physics, finding them to have a random-like nature that lacks a direct link to the physical or mathematical structure of the problems being studied. This suggests that machine learning and the scientific method may offer distinct yet complementary paths to knowledge, with strict explainability remaining elusive. The study also explores parallels between transformer operation and path-integration techniques, attributing the randomness of weights to this relationship but acknowledging that it does not fully resolve the issue of explainability. Ultimately, the research underscores the importance of Insight in gaining knowledge and cautions against relying solely on machine learning techniques for understanding complex physical phenomena. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of transformer-based machine learning applications to the solution of two representative physical applications show a random-like character which bears no directly recognizable link to the physical and mathematical structure of the physical problem under study. This suggests that machine learning and the scientific method may represent two distinct and potentially complementary paths to knowledge, even though a strict notion of explainability in terms of direct correspondence between network parameters and physical structures may remain out of reach. It is also observed that drawing a parallel between transformer operation and (generalized) path-integration techniques may account for the random-like nature of the weights, but still does not resolve the tension with explainability. We conclude with some general comments on the hazards of gleaning knowledge without the benefit of Insight.

Summary:
The paper introduces MoE-CL, a novel framework for continual instruction tuning of large language models in industrial settings. MoE-CL addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting by implementing a dual-expert design: dedicated task-specific experts and a shared expert for cross-task transfer. An adversarial approach is employed, with a task-aware discriminator ensuring that only task-aligned information is passed through the shared expert. This allows for balanced knowledge retention and cross-task generalization, supporting self-evolution of the models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world deployment at Tencent Video show significant cost reductions in manual review. MoE-CL proves to be practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are crucial.

Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.

Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a convolutional neural network.

Abstract: Inter-series correlations are crucial for accurate multivariate time series forecasting, yet these relationships often exhibit complex dynamics across different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Summary:
The article introduces a parameter efficient fine-tuning method called LoRA, which combines low-rank adaptation with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance adaptability across tasks. To establish fair comparisons among different methods, the authors propose a unified benchmark called LoRALib, standardizing datasets from 40 tasks and fine-tuning them with the same hyperparameters. Through large-scale experiments on three LoRA-MoE methods and various LoRA selection mechanisms, the study shows that LoRAMoE performs the best, with prioritizing task-relevant LoRAs further boosting MoE performance.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can save significant costs in storage and computing, but its strong adaptability to a single task is often accompanied by insufficient cross-task generalization capabilities. To improve this, existing work combines LoRA with mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance the model's adaptability through expert modules and routing mechanisms. However, existing LoRA-MoE methods lack unified standards in models, datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods, making it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods. To this end, we proposed a unified benchmark named LoRALib. Specifically, we standardized datasets from $40$ downstream tasks into a unified format, fine-tuned them using the same hyperparameters and obtained $680$ LoRA modules across $17$ model architectures. Based on this LoRA library, we conduct large-scale experiments on $3$ representative LoRA-MoE methods and different LoRA selection mechanisms using the open-sourced testing tool OpenCompass. Extensive experiments show that LoRAMoE performs best, and that prioritizing LoRAs relevant to the target task can further improve the performance of MoE. We hope these findings will inspire future work. Our datasets and LoRA library are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/YaoLuzjut/LoRAOcean_dataset and https://huggingface.co/YaoLuzjut/models.

Summary: <br /> 
The article introduces a new algorithm called Rank-Induced Plackett-Luce Mirror Descent (RIPLM) that utilizes the equivalence between the rank benchmark and distributional benchmark. Unlike previous methods that work with expert identities, RIPLM operates directly in the rank-induced Plackett-Luce parameterization, ensuring that the played distributions stay within the rank-induced distributions class. This feature makes RIPLM the first algorithm to be rank-faithful and variance-adaptive in the sleeping experts setting. By maintaining the equivalence with the rank benchmark and updating the parameters accordingly, RIPLM offers a novel approach to handling distribution updates and variance adaptation in the algorithmic context. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm, \emph{Rank-Induced Plackett--Luce Mirror Descent (RIPLM)}, which leverages the structural equivalence between the \emph{rank benchmark} and the \emph{distributional benchmark} established in \citet{BergamOzcanHsu2022}. Unlike prior approaches that operate on expert identities, RIPLM updates directly in the \emph{rank-induced Plackett--Luce (PL)} parameterization. This ensures that the algorithm's played distributions remain within the class of rank-induced distributions at every round, preserving the equivalence with the rank benchmark. To our knowledge, RIPLM is the first algorithm that is both (i) \emph{rank-faithful} and (ii) \emph{variance-adaptive} in the sleeping experts setting.

<div> Keywords: Machine Learning, FOLD-SE, FOLD-R++, XGBoost, binary classification 

Summary: 
The study compares rule-based classifiers FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++ in binary classification and evaluates FOLD-SE against XGBoost in multi-category classification. It was hypothesized that FOLD-SE may lose some accuracy and efficiency compared to XGBoost and FOLD-R++. Results show FOLD-SE outperforms FOLD-R++ in binary classification with fewer rules and minimal loss in accuracy and processing time. In multi-category classification tasks, FOLD-SE is more precise and efficient than XGBoost while generating understandable rule sets. The study concludes that FOLD-SE is a better choice for both binary and multi-category classifications, demonstrating rule-based models like FOLD-SE can balance explainability and performance in various classification tasks.<br /><br />
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the demand for Machine Learning (ML) models that can balance accuracy, efficiency, and interpreability has grown significantly. Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between accuracy and explainability in predictive models, with models such as Neural Networks achieving high accuracy on complex datasets while sacrificing internal transparency. As such, new rule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible justification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The primary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both rule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE performs against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to multi-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can generate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose upwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with XGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The research used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores, and processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that FOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering fewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in processing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE is more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to generating a comprehensible rule set. The results point out that FOLD-SE is a better choice for both binary tasks and classifications with multiple categories. Therefore, these results demonstrate that rule-based approaches like FOLD-SE can bridge the gap between explainability and performance, highlighting their potential as viable alternatives to black-box models in diverse classification tasks.

Abstract: Metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent a significant global health burden, disproportionately impacting genetically predisposed populations such as the Pima Indians (a Native American tribe from south central Arizona). This study introduces a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates predictive modeling with gene-agnostic pathway mapping to identify high-risk individuals and uncover potential therapeutic targets. Using the Pima Indian dataset, logistic regression and t-tests were applied to identify key predictors of T2DM, yielding an overall model accuracy of 78.43%. To bridge predictive analytics with biological relevance, we developed a pathway mapping strategy that links identified predictors to critical signaling networks, including insulin signaling, AMPK, and PPAR pathways. This approach provides mechanistic insights without requiring direct molecular data. Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic strategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1 modulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment analyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering interpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted intervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are: (1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal component analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a gene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and (3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk populations.

To improve accessibility, KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and biomarker-based subgroup analyses. By automating traditionally manual processes and providing a scalable, web-based solution, KM-GPT transforms clinical research by leveraging reconstructed IPD to enable more informed downstream analyses, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

Summary:
AdaSTI is introduced as a novel spatio-temporal data imputation approach that utilizes a conditional diffusion model. The method incorporates a BiS4PI network for pre-imputation, extracting conditional information through the Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC) network. It also includes the Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that AdaSTI surpasses existing methods, achieving a significant reduction in imputation error of up to 46.4%. The proposed approach addresses error accumulation issues and considers the variability of dependencies in noisy data, thereby enhancing spatio-temporal imputation performance. <div>
arXiv:2509.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model. Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation error.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a multi-label classification framework to predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs) in ICU patients using the first 24 hours of data. The framework focuses on respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration. Using the MIMIC-IV database, rule-based criteria are applied to define CETs in hours 24-72. Features extracted include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and demographics. XGBoost performs best, achieving high F1 scores for each area of deterioration. Feature analysis reveals clinically relevant predictors such as respiratory rate and creatinine as influential factors. The framework shows promise for providing early, interpretable clinical alerts without complex modeling. <div>
arXiv:2509.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care. Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration, using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg, creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss. XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory, 0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration, outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early, interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or natural language processing.

Summary:
ConceptFlow is a new framework for concept-based interpretability in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that aims to provide a more structured and in-depth understanding of model reasoning. It introduces concept attentions to associate filters with high-level concepts for localized interpretation and conceptual pathways to track the propagation of concepts between layers. By tracing the evolution of concepts across layers, ConceptFlow offers insights into the internal "thinking path" of a model, leading to more semantically meaningful explanations of decision behavior. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of ConceptFlow in providing human-aligned explanations and uncovering the hierarchical logic within CNNs. By modeling conceptual pathways, ConceptFlow enhances the interpretability of CNNs and supports the generation of more faithful explanations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework that simulates the internal "thinking path" of a model by tracing how concepts emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i) concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel training-efficient framework called the Sparse Training Scheme (STS) for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The STS consists of two main components: the Visual Token Compressor, which reduces information load by compressing visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which decreases computational overhead by skipping unnecessary layers during training. This approach is applicable to various MLLM architectures and has been tested on multiple benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency in improving training times. The STS addresses the challenge of training inefficiency caused by longer input sequences and underutilization of inter-layer computations in multimodal data processing. The results demonstrate the impact of the proposed framework on enhancing the training process for MLLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0$\times$ fewer samples.

Summary:
WLFM is a foundation model pretrained on well logs that tokenizes log patches into geological tokens. It utilizes self-supervised pretraining and multi-task adaptation for improved performance in porosity estimation and lithology classification. WLFM outperforms existing baselines with reduced mean square error and increased accuracy. WLFM-Finetune further enhances performance. The model shows layer-awareness, learns a geological vocabulary, and accurately reconstructs masked curves. Despite some offsets in specific intervals, WLFM demonstrates potential for boundary detection.

Abstract: Well-log interpretation is fundamental for subsurface characterization but remains challenged by heterogeneous tool responses, noisy signals, and limited labels. We propose WLFM, a foundation model pretrained on multi-curve logs from 1200 wells, comprising three stages: tokenization of log patches into geological tokens, self-supervised pretraining with masked-token modeling and stratigraphy-aware contrastive learning, and multi-task adaptation with few-shot fine-tuning. WLFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 0.0041 MSE in porosity estimation and 74.13\% accuracy in lithology classification, while WLFM-Finetune further improves to 0.0038 MSE and 78.10\% accuracy. Beyond predictive accuracy, WLFM exhibits emergent layer-awareness, learns a reusable geological vocabulary, and reconstructs masked curves with reasonable fidelity, though systematic offsets are observed in shallow and ultra-deep intervals. Although boundary detection is not explicitly evaluated here, clustering analyses suggest strong potential for future extension. These results establish WLFM as a scalable, interpretable, and transferable backbone for geological AI, with implications for multi-modal integration of logs, seismic, and textual data.

By leveraging a large-scale protein language model and reinforcement learning, the framework efficiently generates diverse and effective peptide candidates. Through in vitro evaluations, the designed peptides exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against clinically relevant bacteria, with most showing broad-spectrum effectiveness. The lead molecules primarily act on bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, highlighting their mechanism of action. This integrated approach offers a promising strategy for rapidly developing peptide antibiotics with high potency and broad efficacy to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. <div>

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within hours.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

Summary:
- The paper explores the optimization of activation functions in neural networks by using parameterized linear B-spline functions.
- It compares 9 training methodologies to find the most optimal activation shapes for neurons in the network.
- Experiments show significant improvements in accuracy and parameter efficiency, with up to 94% lower error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models.
- These gains come with the trade-off of increased development and training complexity as well as higher end model latency.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation functions in neural networks are typically selected from a set of empirically validated, commonly used static functions such as ReLU, tanh, or sigmoid. However, by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions, we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning more optimal activations to the neurons. In this paper, I present and compare 9 training methodologies to explore dual-optimization dynamics in neural networks with parameterized linear B-spline activation functions. The experiments realize up to 94% lower end model error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models. These gains come at the cost of additional development and training complexity as well as end model latency.

<div> Reinforcement learning, last-mile delivery, drone, truck, battery management <br />
Summary: <br />
The study explores last-mile delivery efficiency using a truck and drone system with explicit battery management. A hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) solver combines an ALNS-based truck tour with a pointer/attention policy for optimal drone scheduling. The policy considers launch, service, and rendezvous constraints, ensuring endurance and post-delivery recharge requirements are met. Testing on Euclidean instances shows the RL method outperforms ALNS by 2.73% on average and closely matches a neural network (NN) approach. The RL scheduler consistently matches or surpasses ALNS results and ties or exceeds NN performance in some cases. Analysis reveals a balance between truck efficiency and wait times in the learned scheduler, ultimately minimizing total completion time. The study provides a configurable implementation with plotting and significance testing tools to facilitate replication. <div>
arXiv:2509.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study last-mile delivery with one truck and one drone under explicit battery management: the drone flies at twice the truck speed; each sortie must satisfy an endurance budget; after every delivery the drone recharges on the truck before the next launch. We introduce a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) solver that couples an ALNS-based truck tour (with 2/3-opt and Or-opt) with a small pointer/attention policy that schedules drone sorties. The policy decodes launch--serve--rendezvous triplets with hard feasibility masks for endurance and post-delivery recharge; a fast, exact timeline simulator enforces launch/recovery handling and computes the true makespan used by masked greedy/beam decoding. On Euclidean instances with $N{=}50$, $E{=}0.7$, and $R{=}0.1$, the method achieves an average makespan of \textbf{5.203}$\pm$0.093, versus \textbf{5.349}$\pm$0.038 for ALNS and \textbf{5.208}$\pm$0.124 for NN -- i.e., \textbf{2.73\%} better than ALNS on average and within \textbf{0.10\%} of NN. Per-seed, the RL scheduler never underperforms ALNS on the same instance and ties or beats NN on two of three seeds. A decomposition of the makespan shows the expected truck--wait trade-off across heuristics; the learned scheduler balances both to minimize the total completion time. We provide a config-first implementation with plotting and significance-test utilities to support replication.

Summary: <br />
Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present challenges in understanding mathematical and logical tasks due to their denoising process. Current training methods focus on improving general knowledge retention and reasoning abilities but lack in-depth understanding of specific patterns. A new strategy called DSFT, which adjusts masking and loss functions, aims to guide models in recognizing mathematical and logical patterns. DSFT can be combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other methods. Validated on models like LLaDA and Dream series, DSFT shows improvements on mathematical and logical problems. This masking approach provides insights for learning specific patterns efficiently in dLLMs, offering potential for integration with various training methods. The publicly available code allows for easy application of DSFT in future research. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function, guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DSFT-0FFB/

Summary:
MobiGPT is a unified model designed for accurate and efficient forecasting of mobile data, such as base station traffic, user app usage, and channel quality. Through the use of soft-prompt learning and temporal masking mechanisms, MobiGPT is able to accurately predict short-term, long-term, and distribution generation scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that MobiGPT outperforms existing models in forecasting accuracy, with a significant improvement in generalization and transferability to unseen scenarios. The model demonstrates a strong foundation for multi-type forecasting in large-scale, heterogeneous mobile networks, offering operators valuable insights for optimizing network resources and improving service quality.

arXiv:2509.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting, production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage, and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over 100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting. Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%, 20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51% improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent systems.

Summary:
The article introduces the FedIA framework for Federated Graph Learning under domain skew, addressing the issue of incompatible representations due to noisy gradient signals. The framework employs a projection-first strategy, denoising client updates before aggregation. It consists of a server-side top-$\rho$ mask to retain informative coordinates and an influence-regularised momentum weight to suppress outlier clients. FedIA demonstrates smoother convergence and higher accuracy compared to nine strong baselines on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs like Twitch Gamers and Wikipedia. It maintains an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ with no additional uplink traffic and minimal server memory usage, making it easily deployable. <div>
arXiv:2509.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks -- drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from "aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage, plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds \emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous (Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows that dynamic projection maintains the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ rate.

<div> Large language models, Post-Training Quantization, compression, representation points, SBVR<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel quantization method, SBVR, for efficiently compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing quantization methods either fail to account for the weight distribution of LLMs or suffer from degraded inference speed due to memory access patterns. SBVR addresses these limitations by mapping weight values to non-uniform representation points that follow the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression. Furthermore, a custom CUDA kernel allows matrix-vector multiplication directly in the SBVR format, leading to high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Evaluations show that SBVR outperforms existing methods by achieving state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy benchmarks while delivering a significant end-to-end token-generation speedup of 2.21x-3.04x over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization regime. <div>
arXiv:2509.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data. Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest (RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR (Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression. Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization regime.

Summary:
The study focuses on exploring the geospatial route cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a large-scale benchmark evaluation. A dataset of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises worldwide is created for evaluation. PathBuilder, a novel tool, is introduced to convert natural language instructions into navigation routes. A new evaluation framework and metrics are proposed to assess 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on route reversal task. The results highlight limitations in LLMs' ability to reverse routes accurately, with many not returning to the starting point or resembling the optimal route. Challenges identified include low robustness in route generation and high confidence in incorrect answers. The study provides valuable insights into the geospatial cognition abilities of LLMs and offers a new perspective on evaluating their performance in this domain.

Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for their incorrect answers.

<div> Keywords: Conversational agents, Egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning, Multimodal spatial orientation, Chain-of-thought framework, Curriculum learning strategy

Summary: 
Conversational agents face the challenge of translating egocentric utterances into allocentric orientations, especially in settings with weak GPS signals. A new benchmark, Conversational Orientation Reasoning (COR), has been introduced for Traditional Chinese conversational navigation, tackling egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed scenarios. A multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a structured three-step reasoning process. Experiments show that MCoT achieves high orientation accuracy, even in noisy conversational conditions and cross-domain evaluation. The model demonstrates robustness under linguistic variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These results suggest that structured MCoT spatial reasoning has the potential to enhance embodied navigation in resource-constrained settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2) mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation. A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100% orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts, substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover, MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

Abstract: Task vectors capture how a model changes during fine-tuning by recording the difference between pre-trained and task-specific weights. The composition of task vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate knowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In this paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition coefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian inference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level, our framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the observation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a Spike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most informative components. To further address the high variance and sampling inefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling mechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition coefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more stable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting reliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving transparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by selectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task vectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach, establishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector composition.

Abstract: The size, diversity, and quality of pretraining datasets critically determine the generalization ability of foundation models. Despite their growing importance in chemoinformatics, the effectiveness of molecular representation learning has been hindered by limitations in existing small molecule datasets. To address this gap, we present MolPILE, large-scale, diverse, and rigorously curated collection of 222 million compounds, constructed from 6 large-scale databases using an automated curation pipeline. We present a comprehensive analysis of current pretraining datasets, highlighting considerable shortcomings for training ML models, and demonstrate how retraining existing models on MolPILE yields improvements in generalization performance. This work provides a standardized resource for model training, addressing the pressing need for an ImageNet-like dataset in molecular chemistry.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance, its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern, significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy, communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d. datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond the benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.

<title>Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.
  Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.
  The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.
  A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.
  To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations.
  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.

Abstract: Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task. Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.

Abstract: Deep learning optimizers are optimization algorithms that enable deep neural networks to learn. The effectiveness of learning is highly dependent on the optimizer employed in the training process. Alongside the rapid advancement of deep learning, a wide range of optimizers with different approaches have been developed. This study aims to provide a review of various optimizers that have been proposed and received attention in the literature. From Stochastic gradient descent to the most recent ones such as Momentum, AdamW, Sophia, and Muon in chronological order, optimizers are examined individually, and their distinctive features are highlighted in the study. The update rule of each optimizer is presented in detail, with an explanation of the associated concepts and variables. The techniques applied by these optimizers, their contributions to the optimization process, and their default hyperparameter settings are also discussed. In addition, insights are offered into the open challenges encountered in the optimization of deep learning models. Thus, a comprehensive resource is provided both for understanding the current state of optimizers and for identifying potential areas of future development.

Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery are essential.

Abstract: Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults (experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study, emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion intervention strategies in healthcare.

Abstract: The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.

Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering, and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations, but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices; manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods, yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework designed for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention, which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance. Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate, addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset, which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people, individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data. Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally, PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear manifold.

Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

Abstract: Embedding vectors are widely used for representing unstructured data and searching through it for semantically similar items. However, the large size of these vectors, due to their high-dimensionality, creates problems for modern vector search techniques: retrieving large vectors from memory/storage is expensive and their footprint is costly. In this work, we present NVQ (non-uniform vector quantization), a new vector compression technique that is computationally and spatially efficient in the high-fidelity regime. The core in NVQ is to use novel parsimonious and computationally efficient nonlinearities for building non-uniform vector quantizers. Critically, these quantizers are \emph{individually} learned for each indexed vector. Our experimental results show that NVQ exhibits improved accuracy compared to the state of the art with a minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.

Abstract: The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive. While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge: forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs, a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.

Abstract: Money laundering is a critical global issue for financial institutions. Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8% higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.

Abstract: A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification, scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning recipe for diverse biology tasks.

<title>Symphony-MoE: Harmonizing Disparate Pre-trained Models into a Coherent Mixture-of-Experts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18542</link>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a single lightweight stage of router training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: The meta-task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models of Google DeepMind. Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of configurations that we call $(\mathsf{m}, \mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\mathsf{m}, \mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\mathsf{m}$ and relative bias $\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.

Abstract: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.

<title>Interaction Topological Transformer for Multiscale Learning in Porous Materials</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels, including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization. ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.

<title>DS-Diffusion: Data Style-Guided Diffusion Model for Time-Series Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18584</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance. There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore, the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce "Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld (achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps, demonstrating its computational efficiency.

<title>Flow marching for a generative PDE foundation model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT) that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids, achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n \times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

arXiv:2509.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.

Abstract: This research focuses on rational pesticide design, using graph machine learning to accelerate the development of safer, eco-friendly agrochemicals, inspired by in silico methods in drug discovery. With an emphasis on ecotoxicology, the initial contributions include the creation of ApisTox, the largest curated dataset on pesticide toxicity to honey bees. We conducted a broad evaluation of machine learning (ML) models for molecular graph classification, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, GNNs, and pretrained transformers. The results show that methods successful in medicinal chemistry often fail to generalize to agrochemicals, underscoring the need for domain-specific models and benchmarks. Future work will focus on developing a comprehensive benchmarking suite and designing ML models tailored to the unique challenges of pesticide discovery.

<title>A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18714</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design. LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability. Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations, underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.

arXiv:2509.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel convolutional neural network architecture, termed the \emph{periodic CNN}, which incorporates periodic boundary conditions into the convolutional layers. Our main theoretical contribution is a rigorous approximation theorem: periodic CNNs can approximate ridge functions depending on $d-1$ linear variables in a $d$-dimensional input space, while such approximation is impossible in lower-dimensional ridge settings ($d-2$ or fewer variables). This result establishes a sharp characterization of the expressive power of periodic CNNs. Beyond the theory, our findings suggest that periodic CNNs are particularly well-suited for problems where data naturally admits a ridge-like structure of high intrinsic dimension, such as image analysis on wrapped domains, physics-informed learning, and materials science. The work thus both expands the mathematical foundation of CNN approximation theory and highlights a class of architectures with surprising and practically relevant approximation capabilities.

Abstract: Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate connection.

arXiv:2509.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks has been increasingly applied in fault diagnostics, where it uses historical data
  to capture systems behavior, bypassing the need for high-fidelity physical models.
  However, despite their competence in prediction tasks, these models often struggle with
  the evaluation of their confidence. This matter is particularly
  important in consistency-based diagnosis where decision logic is highly sensitive to false alarms.
  To address this challenge, this work presents a diagnostic framework that uses
  ensemble probabilistic machine learning to
  improve diagnostic characteristics of data driven consistency based diagnosis
  by quantifying and automating the prediction uncertainty.
  The proposed method is evaluated across several case studies using both ablation
  and comparative analyses, showing consistent improvements across a range of diagnostic metrics.

Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.

<title>Graph-based Clustering Revisited: A Relaxation of Kernel $k$-Means Perspective</title>

arXiv:2509.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known graph-based clustering methods, including spectral clustering, symmetric non-negative matrix factorization, and doubly stochastic normalization, can be viewed as relaxations of the kernel $k$-means approach. However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank, nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper, guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lwl-learning/LoRD.

Abstract: Expanding neural networks during training is a promising way to augment capacity without retraining larger models from scratch. However, newly added neurons often fail to adjust to a trained network and become inactive, providing no contribution to capacity growth. We propose the Shared-Weights Extender (SWE), a novel method explicitly designed to prevent inactivity of new neurons by coupling them with existing ones for smooth integration. In parallel, we introduce the Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD), a gradient-based method for allocating neurons across layers during deep network expansion. Our extensive benchmarking on four datasets shows that our method can effectively suppress neuron inactivity and achieve better performance compared to other expanding methods and baselines.

<title>NGRPO: Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero, leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO, DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/nangongrui-ngr/NGRPO.

<title>Exploring Heterophily in Graph-level Tasks</title>

Abstract: While heterophily has been widely studied in node-level tasks, its impact on graph-level tasks remains unclear. We present the first analysis of heterophily in graph-level learning, combining theoretical insights with empirical validation. We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and focus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular labeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key insight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif detection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple spectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently misaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural considerations. Experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled heterophily and real-world molecular property prediction support our findings, showing that frequency-adaptive model outperform frequency-dominated models. This work establishes a new theoretical understanding of heterophily in graph-level learning and offers guidance for designing effective GNN architectures.

<title>Enhancing the Effectiveness and Durability of Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning through Maximizing Task Distinction</title>

Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a central model without sharing their private data. However, this distributed nature also exposes new attack surfaces. In particular, backdoor attacks allow attackers to implant malicious behaviors into the global model while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Existing attacks usually rely on fixed patterns or adversarial perturbations as triggers, which tightly couple the main and backdoor tasks. This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by honest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this work, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task by dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The inner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples, ensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the backdoor. The outer process injects the adaptive triggers into the local model. We evaluate our method on both computer vision and natural language tasks, and compare it with six backdoor attack methods under six defense algorithms. Experimental results show that our method achieves good attack performance and can be easily integrated into existing backdoor attack techniques.

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes, important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process, which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when lacking an expert algorithm.

<title>Towards Privacy-Aware Bayesian Networks: A Credal Approach</title>

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks (CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical, and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic graphical models.

Abstract: Ensemble methods for stream mining necessitate managing multiple models and updating them as data distributions evolve. Considering the calls for more sustainability, established methods are however not sufficiently considerate of ensemble members' computational expenses and instead overly focus on predictive capabilities. To address these challenges and enable green online learning, we propose heterogeneous online ensembles (HEROS). For every training step, HEROS chooses a subset of models from a pool of models initialized with diverse hyperparameter choices under resource constraints to train. We introduce a Markov decision process to theoretically capture the trade-offs between predictive performance and sustainability constraints. Based on this framework, we present different policies for choosing which models to train on incoming data. Most notably, we propose the novel $\zeta$-policy, which focuses on training near-optimal models at reduced costs. Using a stochastic model, we theoretically prove that our $\zeta$-policy achieves near optimal performance while using fewer resources compared to the best performing policy. In our experiments across 11 benchmark datasets, we find empiric evidence that our $\zeta$-policy is a strong contribution to the state-of-the-art, demonstrating highly accurate performance, in some cases even outperforming competitors, and simultaneously being much more resource-friendly.

Abstract: This paper establishes central limit theorems for Polyak-Ruppert averaged Q-learning under asynchronous updates. We present a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, where the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance explicitly reflects the dependence on the number of iterations, state-action space size, the discount factor, and the quality of exploration. In addition, we derive a functional central limit theorem, showing that the partial-sum process converges weakly to a Brownian motion.

<title>Otters: An Energy-Efficient SpikingTransformer via Optical Time-to-First-Spike Encoding</title>

arXiv:2509.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process. Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All codes and data are open source.

Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions. SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited regimes.

<title>CR-Net: Scaling Parameter-Efficient Training with Cross-Layer Low-Rank Structure</title>

Abstract: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1) compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3) limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters. We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

Abstract: Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.

Abstract: Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However, these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore, we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL, our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks. However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture. OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and models are released at https://github.com/xiao-xt/OmniBridge.

<title>Improving Credit Card Fraud Detection through Transformer-Enhanced GAN Oversampling</title>

Abstract: Detection of credit card fraud is an acute issue of financial security because transaction datasets are highly lopsided, with fraud cases being only a drop in the ocean. Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of traditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily applicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in tabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with high-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach where we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder block to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN architecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the Transformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by self-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE, CTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority classes samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative resampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings indicate that our Transformer-based GAN shows substantial gains in Recall, F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which indicates that it is effective in overcoming the severe class imbalance inherent in the task of fraud detection.

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for black-box adversarial attacks.

arXiv:2509.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs), driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development. This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF) algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a demonstrably superior solution.
  A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned before comparison.
  Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape, challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.
  Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies, validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future energy-efficient deep learning.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.

Abstract: We study the non-contextual multi-armed bandit problem in a transfer learning setting: before any pulls, the learner is given N'_k i.i.d. samples from each source distribution nu'_k, and the true target distributions nu_k lie within a known distance bound d_k(nu_k, nu'_k) <= L_k. In this framework, we first derive a problem-dependent asymptotic lower bound on cumulative regret that extends the classical Lai-Robbins result to incorporate the transfer parameters (d_k, L_k, N'_k). We then propose KL-UCB-Transfer, a simple index policy that matches this new bound in the Gaussian case. Finally, we validate our approach via simulations, showing that KL-UCB-Transfer significantly outperforms the no-prior baseline when source and target distributions are sufficiently close.

Abstract: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.

<title>DRO-REBEL: Distributionally Robust Relative-Reward Regression for Fast and Efficient LLM Alignment</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability, and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL, making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.

Abstract: The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high consistency with the pre-trained model.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.

Abstract: Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE) integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively. Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.

<title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Reducing Forgetting with Elephant Activation Functions</title>

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and memory-efficient.

<title>Unveiling the Role of Learning Rate Schedules via Functional Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL), which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for improving large-scale model training.

<title>A Validation Strategy for Deep Learning Models: Evaluating and Enhancing Robustness</title>

Abstract: Data-driven models, especially deep learning classifiers often demonstrate great success on clean datasets. Yet, they remain vulnerable to common data distortions such as adversarial and common corruption perturbations. These perturbations can significantly degrade performance, thereby challenging the overall reliability of the models. Traditional robustness validation typically relies on perturbed test datasets to assess and improve model performance. In our framework, however, we propose a validation approach that extracts "weak robust" samples directly from the training dataset via local robustness analysis. These samples, being the most susceptible to perturbations, serve as an early and sensitive indicator of the model's vulnerabilities. By evaluating models on these challenging training instances, we gain a more nuanced understanding of its robustness, which informs targeted performance enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models trained with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, highlighting how robustness validation guided by weak robust samples can drive meaningful improvements in model reliability under adversarial and common corruption scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning in practice must contend with heterogeneous feature spaces, severe non-IID data, and scarce labels across clients. We present FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn, DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes, FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation, domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust federated learning under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have enabled the creation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent clips from natural language prompts. Yet these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps. We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative video systems.

Abstract: In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the corresponding Github page.

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization. While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks, its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression validate these theoretical predictions.

<title>What Characterizes Effective Reasoning? Revisiting Length, Review, and Structure of CoT</title>

arXiv:2509.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy.
  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i) incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread. Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements, operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework for planning their LLM strategies.

Abstract: This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and cross-domain adaptation.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of wearable sensors and implantable devices is shifting AI processing demands to the extreme edge, necessitating ultra-low power for continuous operation. Inspired by the brain, emerging memristive devices promise to accelerate neural network training by eliminating costly data transfers between compute and memory. Though, balancing performance and energy efficiency remains a challenge. We investigate ferroelectric synaptic devices based on HfO2/ZrO2 superlattices and feed their experimentally measured weight updates into hardware-aware neural network simulations. Across pulse widths from 20 ns to 0.2 ms, shorter pulses lower per-update energy but require more training epochs while still reducing total energy without sacrificing accuracy. Classification accuracy using plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is diminished compared to mixed-precision SGD. We analyze the causes and propose a ``symmetry point shifting'' technique, addressing asymmetric updates and restoring accuracy. These results highlight a trade-off among accuracy, convergence speed, and energy use, showing that short-pulse programming with tailored training significantly enhances on-chip learning efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series data.

Abstract: This paper addresses distributed optimization problems in non-i.i.d. scenarios, focusing on the interplay between communication and computation efficiency. To this end, we propose FlexGT, a flexible snapshot gradient tracking method with tunable numbers of local updates and neighboring communications in each round. Leveraging a unified convergence analysis framework, we prove that FlexGT achieves a linear or sublinear convergence rate depending on objective-specific properties--from (strongly) convex to nonconvex--and the above-mentioned tunable parameters. FlexGT is provably robust to the heterogeneity across nodes and attains the best-known communication and computation complexity among existing results. Moreover, we introduce an accelerated gossip-based variant, termed Acc-FlexGT, and show that with prior knowledge of the graph, it achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between communication and computation. Particularly, Acc-FlexGT achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( L/\epsilon +L\sigma ^2/\left( n\epsilon^2 \sqrt{1-\sqrt{\rho _W}} \right) \right) $ for the nonconvex case, matching the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor, and improves the existing results for the strongly convex case by a factor of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( 1/\sqrt{\epsilon} \right)$, where $\epsilon$ is the targeted accuracy, $n$ the number of nodes, $L$ the Lipschitz constant, $\rho_W$ the spectrum gap of the graph, and $\sigma$ the stochastic gradient variance. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Dual Tree Single Clock (DTSC) Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron (ACN) circuits offer the potential for highly energy-efficient Artificial Neural Network (ANN) computation in full custom analog IC designs. The efficient mapping of Artificial Neuron (AN) abstract weights, extracted from the software-trained ANNs, onto physical ACN capacitance values has, however, yet to be fully researched. In this paper, we explore the unexpected hidden complexities, challenges and properties of the mapping, as well as, the ramifications for IC designers in terms accuracy, design and implementation. We propose an optimal, AN to ACN methodology, that promotes smaller chip sizes and improved overall classification accuracy, necessary for successful practical deployment. Using TensorFlow and Larq software frameworks, we train three different ANN networks and map their weights into the energy-efficient DTSC ACN capacitance value domain to demonstrate 100% functional equivalency. Finally, we delve into the impact of weight quantization on ACN performance using novel metrics related to practical IC considerations, such as IC floor space and comparator decision-making efficacy.

<title>Augmenting Limited and Biased RCTs through Pseudo-Sample Matching-Based Observational Data Fusion Method</title>

Abstract: In the online ride-hailing pricing context, companies often conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and utilize uplift models to assess the effect of discounts on customer orders, which substantially influences competitive market outcomes. However, due to the high cost of RCTs, the proportion of trial data relative to observational data is small, which only accounts for 0.65\% of total traffic in our context, resulting in significant bias when generalizing to the broader user base. Additionally, the complexity of industrial processes reduces the quality of RCT data, which is often subject to heterogeneity from potential interference and selection bias, making it difficult to correct. Moreover, existing data fusion methods are challenging to implement effectively in complex industrial settings due to the high dimensionality of features and the strict assumptions that are hard to verify with real-world data. To address these issues, we propose an empirical data fusion method called pseudo-sample matching. By generating pseudo-samples from biased, low-quality RCT data and matching them with the most similar samples from large-scale observational data, the method expands the RCT dataset while mitigating its heterogeneity. We validated the method through simulation experiments, conducted offline and online tests using real-world data. In a week-long online experiment, we achieved a 0.41\% improvement in profit, which is a considerable gain when scaled to industrial scenarios with hundreds of millions in revenue. In addition, we discuss the harm to model training, offline evaluation, and online economic benefits when the RCT data quality is not high, and emphasize the importance of improving RCT data quality in industrial scenarios. Further details of the simulation experiments can be found in the GitHub repository https://github.com/Kairong-Han/Pseudo-Matching.

<title>Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode</title>

Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<title>Surrogate Modelling of Proton Dose with Monte Carlo Dropout Uncertainty Quantification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Accurate proton dose calculation using Monte Carlo (MC) is computationally demanding in workflows like robust optimisation, adaptive replanning, and probabilistic inference, which require repeated evaluations. To address this, we develop a neural surrogate that integrates Monte Carlo dropout to provide fast, differentiable dose predictions along with voxelwise predictive uncertainty. The method is validated through a series of experiments, starting with a one-dimensional analytic benchmark that establishes accuracy, convergence, and variance decomposition. Two-dimensional bone-water phantoms, generated using TOPAS Geant4, demonstrate the method's behavior under domain heterogeneity and beam uncertainty, while a three-dimensional water phantom confirms scalability for volumetric dose prediction. Across these settings, we separate epistemic (model) from parametric (input) contributions, showing that epistemic variance increases under distribution shift, while parametric variance dominates at material boundaries. The approach achieves significant speedups over MC while retaining uncertainty information, making it suitable for integration into robust planning, adaptive workflows, and uncertainty-aware optimisation in proton therapy.

Abstract: Learning Progressions (LPs) can help adjust instruction to individual learners needs if the LPs reflect diverse ways of thinking about a construct being measured, and if the LP-aligned assessments meaningfully measure this diversity. The process of doing science is inherently multi-modal with scientists utilizing drawings, writing and other modalities to explain phenomena. Thus, fostering deep science understanding requires supporting students in using multiple modalities when explaining phenomena. We build on a validated NGSS-aligned multi-modal LP reflecting diverse ways of modeling and explaining electrostatic phenomena and associated assessments. We focus on students modeling, an essential practice for building a deep science understanding. Supporting culturally and linguistically diverse students in building modeling skills provides them with an alternative mode of communicating their understanding, essential for equitable science assessment. Machine learning (ML) has been used to score open-ended modeling tasks (e.g., drawings), and short text-based constructed scientific explanations, both of which are time- consuming to score. We use ML to evaluate LP-aligned scientific models and the accompanying short text-based explanations reflecting multi-modal understanding of electrical interactions in high school Physical Science. We show how LP guides the design of personalized ML-driven feedback grounded in the diversity of student thinking on both assessment modes.

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM) performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning, summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available at https://github.com/younatics/zera-agent.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of 1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96) on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable, trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer prevention.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically, the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency. The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and enhance the performance of AI models.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion, improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set. This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various applications.

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS) in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance. Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building, our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban governance.

Abstract: Cooperative and non-cooperative localization frequently arise together in wireless sensor networks, particularly when sensor positions are uncertain and targets are unable to communicate with the network. While joint processing can eliminate the delay in target estimation found in sequential approaches, it introduces complex variable coupling, posing challenges in both modeling and optimization. This paper presents a joint modeling approach that formulates cooperative and non-cooperative localization as a single optimization problem. To address the resulting coupling, we introduce auxiliary variables that enable structural decoupling and distributed computation. Building on this formulation, we develop the Scaled Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization (SP-ADMM-JCNL). Leveraging the problem's structured design, we provide theoretical guarantees that the algorithm generates a sequence converging globally to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the reformulated problem and further to a critical point of the original non-convex objective function, with a sublinear rate of O(1/T). Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that SP-ADMM-JCNL achieves accurate and reliable localization performance.

Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output? Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations. Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance, found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics: meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning, alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and, ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models, diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

Abstract: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images, fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

Abstract: Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process (manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks, ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for computer control.

<title>The Illusion of Readiness: Stress Testing Large Frontier Models on Multimodal Medical Benchmarks</title>

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.

<title>PEEK: Guiding and Minimal Image Representations for Zero-Shot Generalization of Robot Manipulation Policies</title>

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act. We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation: 1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning 9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what, and how. Website at https://peek-robot.github.io/.

Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes. However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition, including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences, achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods achieving 25%).

Abstract: We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.

Abstract: Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging information across related tasks to improve predictive performance on new tasks. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing meta-learning through the lens of predictor subspace characterization and quantification of task diversity. Specifically, we model the shared structure across tasks using a latent subspace and introduce a measure of diversity that captures heterogeneity across task-specific predictors. We provide both simulation-based and theoretical evidence indicating that achieving the desired prediction accuracy in meta-learning depends on the proportion of predictor variance aligned with the shared subspace, as well as on the accuracy of subspace estimation.

<title>A Single Image Is All You Need: Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization Without Training Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

<title>G\"odel Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures?</title>

Abstract: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.

<title>Measurement Score-Based MRI Reconstruction with Automatic Coil Sensitivity Estimation</title>

arXiv:2509.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have recently shown outstanding performance in compressed-sensing parallel MRI reconstruction by combining diffusion priors with physical measurement models. However, they typically rely on pre-calibrated coil sensitivity maps (CSMs) and ground truth images, making them often impractical: CSMs are difficult to estimate accurately under heavy undersampling and ground-truth images are often unavailable. We propose Calibration-free Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (C-MSM), a new method that eliminates these dependencies by jointly performing automatic CSM estimation and self-supervised learning of measurement scores directly from k-space data. C-MSM reconstructs images by approximating the full posterior distribution through stochastic sampling over partial measurement posterior scores, while simultaneously estimating CSMs. Experiments on the multi-coil brain fastMRI dataset show that C-MSM achieves reconstruction performance close to DIS with clean diffusion priors -- even without access to clean training data and pre-calibrated CSMs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a transferable solution method for optimal control problems with varying objectives using function encoder (FE) policies. Traditional optimization-based approaches must be re-solved whenever objectives change, resulting in prohibitive computational costs for applications requiring frequent evaluation and adaptation. The proposed method learns a reusable set of neural basis functions that spans the control policy space, enabling efficient zero-shot adaptation to new tasks through either projection from data or direct mapping from problem specifications. The key idea is an offline-online decomposition: basis functions are learned once during offline imitation learning, while online adaptation requires only lightweight coefficient estimation. Numerical experiments across diverse dynamics, dimensions, and cost structures show our method delivers near-optimal performance with minimal overhead when generalizing across tasks, enabling semi-global feedback policies suitable for real-time deployment.

Abstract: Identifying sequences of syllables within birdsongs is key to tackling a wide array of challenges, including bird individual identification and better understanding of animal communication and sensory-motor learning. Recently, machine learning approaches have demonstrated great potential to alleviate the need for experts to label long audio recordings by hand. However, they still typically rely on the availability of labelled data for model training, restricting applicability to a few species and datasets. In this work, we build the first fully unsupervised algorithm to decompose birdsong recordings into sequences of syllables. We first detect syllable events, then cluster them to extract templates --syllable representations-- before performing matching pursuit to decompose the recording as a sequence of syllables. We evaluate our automatic annotations against human labels on a dataset of Bengalese finch songs and find that our unsupervised method achieves high performance. We also demonstrate that our approach can distinguish individual birds within a species through their unique vocal signatures, for both Bengalese finches and another species, the great tit.

Abstract: Voice anonymization aims to conceal speaker identity and attributes while preserving intelligibility, but current evaluations rely almost exclusively on Equal Error Rate (EER) that obscures whether adversaries can mount high-precision attacks. We argue that privacy should instead be evaluated in the low false-positive rate (FPR) regime, where even a small number of successful identifications constitutes a meaningful breach. To this end, we introduce VoxGuard, a framework grounded in differential privacy and membership inference that formalizes two complementary notions: User Privacy, preventing speaker re-identification, and Attribute Privacy, protecting sensitive traits such as gender and accent. Across synthetic and real datasets, we find that informed adversaries, especially those using fine-tuned models and max-similarity scoring, achieve orders-of-magnitude stronger attacks at low-FPR despite similar EER. For attributes, we show that simple transparent attacks recover gender and accent with near-perfect accuracy even after anonymization. Our results demonstrate that EER substantially underestimates leakage, highlighting the need for low-FPR evaluation, and recommend VoxGuard as a benchmark for evaluating privacy leakage.

Abstract: The 2024 US presidential election is the first major contest to occur in the US since the popularization of large language models (LLMs). Building on lessons from earlier shifts in media (most notably social media's well studied role in targeted messaging and political polarization) this moment raises urgent questions about how LLMs may shape the information ecosystem and influence political discourse. While platforms have announced some election safeguards, how well they work in practice remains unclear. Against this backdrop, we conduct a large-scale, longitudinal study of 12 models, queried using a structured survey with over 12,000 questions on a near-daily cadence from July through November 2024. Our design systematically varies content and format, resulting in a rich dataset that enables analyses of the models' behavior over time (e.g., across model updates), sensitivity to steering, responsiveness to instructions, and election-related knowledge and "beliefs." In the latter half of our work, we perform four analyses of the dataset that (i) study the longitudinal variation of model behavior during election season, (ii) illustrate the sensitivity of election-related responses to demographic steering, (iii) interrogate the models' beliefs about candidates' attributes, and (iv) reveal the models' implicit predictions of the election outcome. To facilitate future evaluations of LLMs in electoral contexts, we detail our methodology, from question generation to the querying pipeline and third-party tooling. We also publicly release our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sarahcen/llm-election-data-2024

Abstract: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$) regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic, factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

<title>Robotic Skill Diversification via Active Mutation of Reward Functions in Reinforcement Learning During a Liquid Pouring Task</title>

Abstract: This paper explores how deliberate mutations of reward function in reinforcement learning can produce diversified skill variations in robotic manipulation tasks, examined with a liquid pouring use case. To this end, we developed a new reward function mutation framework that is based on applying Gaussian noise to the weights of the different terms in the reward function. Inspired by the cost-benefit tradeoff model from human motor control, we designed the reward function with the following key terms: accuracy, time, and effort. The study was performed in a simulation environment created in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and the setup included Franka Emika Panda robotic arm holding a glass with a liquid that needed to be poured into a container. The reinforcement learning algorithm was based on Proximal Policy Optimization. We systematically explored how different configurations of mutated weights in the rewards function would affect the learned policy. The resulting policies exhibit a wide range of behaviours: from variations in execution of the originally intended pouring task to novel skills useful for unexpected tasks, such as container rim cleaning, liquid mixing, and watering. This approach offers promising directions for robotic systems to perform diversified learning of specific tasks, while also potentially deriving meaningful skills for future tasks.

Abstract: The end-cut preference (ECP) problem, referring to the tendency to favor split points near the boundaries of a feature's range, is a well-known issue in CART (Breiman et al., 1984). ECP may induce highly imbalanced and biased splits, obscure weak signals, and lead to tree structures that are both unstable and difficult to interpret. For survival trees, we show that ECP also arises when using greedy search to select the optimal cutoff point by maximizing the log-rank test statistic. To address this issue, we propose a smooth sigmoid surrogate (SSS) approach, in which the hard-threshold indicator function is replaced by a smooth sigmoid function. We further demonstrate, both theoretically and through numerical illustrations, that SSS provides an effective remedy for mitigating or avoiding ECP.

<title>Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effect on Networks via Orthogonal Learning</title>

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on networks is important for both scientific research and practical applications. Unlike traditional settings that assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an intervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others. Understanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks faces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous, varying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units often exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between structural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on networks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance components that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we adjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects through a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances expressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as identifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover effects. We integrate the two stages using Neyman orthogonalization and cross-fitting, which ensures that errors from nuisance estimation contribute only at higher order. As a result, our causal effect estimates are robust to bias and misspecification in modeling causal effects under network dependencies.

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors. This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies.

Abstract: High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However, this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging modalities.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to conform to a specific rhythm using ByT5, a byte-level multilingual transformer-based model. Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process of composing classical Arabic poems.

Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.

Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading health challenges for women, specifically breast and ovarian cancer. Early detection can help improve the survival rate through timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer (ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.

Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans, while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments. Codebase, datasets, and videos for VLN-Zero are available at: https://vln-zero.github.io/.

Abstract: Neural populations exhibit complex recurrent structures that drive behavior, while continuously receiving and integrating external inputs from sensory stimuli, upstream regions, and neurostimulation. However, neural populations are often modeled as autonomous dynamical systems, with little consideration given to the influence of external inputs that shape the population activity and behavioral outcomes. Here, we introduce BRAID, a deep learning framework that models nonlinear neural dynamics underlying behavior while explicitly incorporating any measured external inputs. Our method disentangles intrinsic recurrent neural population dynamics from the effects of inputs by including a forecasting objective within input-driven recurrent neural networks. BRAID further prioritizes the learning of intrinsic dynamics that are related to a behavior of interest by using a multi-stage optimization scheme. We validate BRAID with nonlinear simulations, showing that it can accurately learn the intrinsic dynamics shared between neural and behavioral modalities. We then apply BRAID to motor cortical activity recorded during a motor task and demonstrate that our method more accurately fits the neural-behavioral data by incorporating measured sensory stimuli into the model and improves the forecasting of neural-behavioral data compared with various baseline methods, whether input-driven or not.

<title>Online Learning for Optimizing AoI-Energy Tradeoff under Unknown Channel Statistics</title>

Abstract: We consider a real-time monitoring system where a source node (with energy limitations) aims to keep the information status at a destination node as fresh as possible by scheduling status update transmissions over a set of channels. The freshness of information at the destination node is measured in terms of the Age of Information (AoI) metric. In this setting, a natural tradeoff exists between the transmission cost (or equivalently, energy consumption) of the source and the achievable AoI performance at the destination. This tradeoff has been optimized in the existing literature under the assumption of having a complete knowledge of the channel statistics. In this work, we develop online learning-based algorithms with finite-time guarantees that optimize this tradeoff in the practical scenario where the channel statistics are unknown to the scheduler. In particular, when the channel statistics are known, the optimal scheduling policy is first proven to have a threshold-based structure with respect to the value of AoI (i.e., it is optimal to drop updates when the AoI value is below some threshold). This key insight was then utilized to develop the proposed learning algorithms that surprisingly achieve an order-optimal regret (i.e., $O(1)$) with respect to the time horizon length.

Abstract: A scalable Bayesian machine learning framework is introduced for estimating scalar properties of an unknown quantum state from measurement data, which bypasses full density matrix reconstruction. This work is the first to integrate the classical shadows protocol with a permutation-invariant set transformer architecture, enabling the approach to predict and correct bias in existing estimators to approximate the true Bayesian posterior mean. Measurement outcomes are encoded as fixed-dimensional feature vectors, and the network outputs a residual correction to a baseline estimator. Scalability to large quantum systems is ensured by the polynomial dependence of input size on system size and number of measurements. On Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state fidelity and second-order R\'enyi entropy estimation tasks -- using random Pauli and random Clifford measurements -- this Bayesian estimator always achieves lower mean squared error than classical shadows alone, with more than a 99\% reduction in the few copy regime.

<title>Query-Centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable Robotic Assembly</title>

Abstract: The robotic assembly task poses a key challenge in building generalist robots due to the intrinsic complexity of part interactions and the sensitivity to noise perturbations in contact-rich settings. The assembly agent is typically designed in a hierarchical manner: high-level multi-part reasoning and low-level precise control. However, implementing such a hierarchical policy is challenging in practice due to the mismatch between high-level skill queries and low-level execution. To address this, we propose the Query-centric Diffusion Policy (QDP), a hierarchical framework that bridges high-level planning and low-level control by utilizing queries comprising objects, contact points, and skill information. QDP introduces a query-centric mechanism that identifies task-relevant components and uses them to guide low-level policies, leveraging point cloud observations to improve the policy's robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the FurnitureBench in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating improved performance in skill precision and long-horizon success rate. In the challenging insertion and screwing tasks, QDP improves the skill-wise success rate by over 50% compared to baselines without structured queries.

Abstract: We study nonstationary newsvendor problems under nonparametric demand models and general distributional measures of nonstationarity, addressing the practical challenges of unknown degree of nonstationarity and demand censoring. We propose a novel distributional-detection-and-restart framework for learning in nonstationary environments, and instantiate it through two efficient algorithms for the uncensored and censored demand settings. The algorithms are fully adaptive, requiring no prior knowledge of the degree and type of nonstationarity, and offer a flexible yet powerful approach to handling both abrupt and gradual changes in nonstationary environments. We establish a comprehensive optimality theory for our algorithms by deriving matching regret upper and lower bounds under both general and refined structural conditions with nontrivial proof techniques that are of independent interest. Numerical experiments using real-world datasets, including nurse staffing data for emergency departments and COVID-19 test demand data, showcase the algorithms' superior and robust empirical performance. While motivated by the newsvendor problem, the distributional-detection-and-restart framework applies broadly to a wide class of nonstationary stochastic optimization problems. Managerially, our framework provides a practical, easy-to-deploy, and theoretically grounded solution for decision-making under nonstationarity.

Abstract: This paper studies how insurers can chose which claims to investigate for fraud. Given a prediction model, typically only claims with the highest predicted propability of being fraudulent are investigated. We argue that this can lead to inconsistent learning and propose a randomized alternative. More generally, we draw a parallel with the multi-arm bandit literature and argue that, in the presence of selection, the obtained observations are not iid. Hence, dependence on past observations should be accounted for when updating parameter estimates. We formalize selection in a binary regression framework and show that model updating and maximum-likelihood estimation can be implemented as if claims were investigated at random. Then, we define consistency of selection strategies and conjecture sufficient conditions for consistency. Our simulations suggest that the often-used selection strategy can be inconsistent while the proposed randomized alternative is consistent. Finally, we compare our randomized selection strategy with Thompson sampling, a standard multi-arm bandit heuristic. Our simulations suggest that the latter can be inefficient in learning low fraud probabilities.

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern software management, yet security flaws in IaC scripts can have severe consequences, as exemplified by the recurring exploits of Cloud Web Services. Prior work has recognized the need to build a precise taxonomy of security smells in IaC scripts as a first step towards developing approaches to improve IaC security. This first effort led to the unveiling of seven sins, limited by the focus on a single IaC tool as well as by the extensive, and potentially biased, manual effort that was required. We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy: first, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset with scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some automation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for initial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human validation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study yields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly expanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by implementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC tools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security smells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended periods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools. This work provides IaC practitioners with insights for addressing common security smells and systematically adopting DevSecOps practices to build safer infrastructure code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions. Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision, 95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92 percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

<title>Reconstruction of Optical Coherence Tomography Images from Wavelength-space Using Deep-learning</title>

Abstract: Conventional Fourier-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) systems depend on resampling into wavenumber (k) domain to extract the depth profile. This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images. Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing the power of DL models. We believe that this work lays the framework for further innovations in the realm of OCT image reconstruction.

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure through scripts and tools, streamlining software deployment. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning, which can cover a wide range of typical policy optimization methods by specifying different mirror maps. Existing analysis of PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation (TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD (i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.

Abstract: Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional and unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control, while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$, respectively.

Abstract: Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing, with state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-V3 now performing comparably to proprietary LLMs. This progression raises the question of whether small open-weight LLMs are capable of effectively replacing larger closed-source models. We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions, we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances, open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when ensembling strategies were applied. All code is publicly available at https://github.com/evidenceprime/BioASQ-13b.

Abstract: We propose Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation (Bi-VLA), a novel framework that extends bilateral control-based imitation learning to handle more than one task within a single model. Conventional bilateral control methods exploit joint angle, velocity, torque, and vision for precise manipulation but require task-specific models, limiting their generality. Bi-VLA overcomes this limitation by utilizing robot joint angle, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower bilateral control with visual features and natural language instructions through SigLIP and FiLM-based fusion. We validated Bi-VLA on two task types: one requiring supplementary language cues and another distinguishable solely by vision. Real-robot experiments showed that Bi-VLA successfully interprets vision-language combinations and improves task success rates compared to conventional bilateral control-based imitation learning. Our Bi-VLA addresses the single-task limitation of prior bilateral approaches and provides empirical evidence that combining vision and language significantly enhances versatility. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Bi-VLA in real-world tasks. For additional material, please visit the website: https://mertcookimg.github.io/bi-vla/

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for Edge Inference (EI) that bypasses the conventional practice of treating the wireless channel as noise. We utilize Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIMs) to control wireless propagation, enabling the channel itself to perform over-the-air computation. This eliminates the need for symbol estimation at the receiver, significantly reducing computational and communication overhead. Our approach models the transmitter-channel-receiver system as an end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN) where the response of the SIM elements are trainable parameters. To address channel variability, we incorporate a dedicated DNN module responsible for dynamically adjusting transmission power leveraging user location information. Our performance evaluations showcase that the proposed metasurfaces-integrated DNN framework with deep SIM architectures are capable of balancing classification accuracy and power consumption under diverse scenarios, offering significant energy efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Wireless communications are characterized by their unpredictability, posing challenges for maintaining consistent communication quality. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various prediction models, with a focus on achieving accurate and efficient Wi-Fi link quality forecasts using machine learning techniques. Specifically, the paper evaluates the performance of data-driven models based on the linear combination of exponential moving averages, which are designed for low-complexity implementations and are then suitable for hardware platforms with limited processing resources. Accuracy of the proposed approaches was assessed using experimental data from a real-world Wi-Fi testbed, considering both channel-dependent and channel-independent training data. Remarkably, channel-independent models, which allow for generalized training by equipment manufacturers, demonstrated competitive performance. Overall, this study provides insights into the practical deployment of machine learning-based prediction models for enhancing Wi-Fi dependability in industrial environments.

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury, it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct. This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed. Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical considerations.

Abstract: Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.

<title>VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

<title>Quantum Annealing for Minimum Bisection Problem: A Machine Learning-based Approach for Penalty Parameter Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19005</link>

Abstract: The Minimum Bisection Problem is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, with practical applications in areas such as parallel computing, network design, and machine learning. In this paper, we examine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to solve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation lies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role in ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the problem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine learning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter. Specifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict suitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input graph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the penalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem instance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of minimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions. We test our approach on a large dataset of randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with up to 4,000 nodes, and we compare the results with classical partitioning algorithms, Metis and Kernighan-Lin. Experimental findings demonstrate that our adaptive tuning strategy significantly improves the performance of the quantum annealing hybrid solver and consistently outperforms the classical methods used, indicating its potential as an alternative for the graph partitioning problem.

<title>A Fast Initialization Method for Neural Network Controllers: A Case Study of Image-based Visual Servoing Control for the multicopter Interception</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based controller design methods often require substantial data in the initial training phase. Moreover, the training process tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final interception velocity of 15 m/s.

<title>LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.

Abstract: We argue that the standard circuit complexity measures derived from $NC, AC, TC$ provide limited practical information and are now insufficient to further differentiate model expressivity. To address these new limitations, we define a novel notion of local uniformity and a family of circuit complexity classes $RC(\cdot)$ that capture the fundamental constraints of scaling physical circuits. Through the lens of $RC(\cdot)$, we show that attention mechanisms with $\omega(n^{3/2})$ runtime cannot scale to accommodate the entropy of increasingly complex datasets. Our results simultaneously provide a methodology for defining meaningful bounds on transformer expressivity and naturally expose the restricted viability of attention.

<title>CayleyPy Growth: Efficient growth computations and hundreds of new conjectures on Cayley graphs (Brief version)</title>

Abstract: This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory. We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and Schreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles much larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.
  Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric groups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of quadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is a general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem being NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on diameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to previous O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to involutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the diameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an answer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs generated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.
  For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results on upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of diameter on p. Moreover.
  Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems verifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created more than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth computation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size.

<title>Soft Tokens, Hard Truths</title>

Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

We strengthen the capabilities of our system by building upon prior research within the robustness of XAI, as well as combining well-established techniques like manifold learning with interpolation approaches.

Abstract: This paper proposes the use of the Hellinger--Kantorovich metric from unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) in a dimensionality reduction and learning (supervised and unsupervised) pipeline. The performance of UOT is compared to that of regular OT and Euclidean-based dimensionality reduction methods on several benchmark datasets including MedMNIST. The experimental results demonstrate that, on average, UOT shows improvement over both Euclidean and OT-based methods as verified by statistical hypothesis tests. In particular, on the MedMNIST datasets, UOT outperforms OT in classification 81\% of the time. For clustering MedMNIST, UOT outperforms OT 83\% of the time and outperforms both other metrics 58\% of the time.

Abstract: We study multivariate linear regression under Gaussian covariates in two settings, where data may be erased or corrupted by an adversary under a coordinate-wise budget. In the incomplete data setting, an adversary may inspect the dataset and delete entries in up to an $\eta$-fraction of samples per coordinate; a strong form of the Missing Not At Random model. In the corrupted data setting, the adversary instead replaces values arbitrarily, and the corruption locations are unknown to the learner. Despite substantial work on missing data, linear regression under such adversarial missingness remains poorly understood, even information-theoretically. Unlike the clean setting, where estimation error vanishes with more samples, here the optimal error remains a positive function of the problem parameters. Our main contribution is to characterize this error up to constant factors across essentially the entire parameter range. Specifically, we establish novel information-theoretic lower bounds on the achievable error that match the error of (computationally efficient) algorithms. A key implication is that, perhaps surprisingly, the optimal error in the missing data setting matches that in the corruption setting-so knowing the corruption locations offers no general advantage.

Abstract: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes two algorithms for estimating square Wasserstein distance matrices from a small number of entries. These matrices are used to compute manifold learning embeddings like multidimensional scaling (MDS) or Isomap, but contrary to Euclidean distance matrices, are extremely costly to compute. We analyze matrix completion from upper triangular samples and Nystr\"{o}m completion in which $\mathcal{O}(d\log(d))$ columns of the distance matrices are computed where $d$ is the desired embedding dimension, prove stability of MDS under Nystr\"{o}m completion, and show that it can outperform matrix completion for a fixed budget of sample distances. Finally, we show that classification of the OrganCMNIST dataset from the MedMNIST benchmark is stable on data embedded from the Nystr\"{o}m estimation of the distance matrix even when only 10\% of the columns are computed.

Abstract: Tropical storms cause extensive property damage and loss of life, making them one of the most destructive types of natural hazards. The development of predictive models that identify interventions effective at mitigating storm impacts has considerable potential to reduce these adverse outcomes. In this study, we use an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach for optimizing intervention schemes that improve resilience to coastal flooding. We combine three different AI models to optimize the selection of intervention types, sites, and scales in order to minimize the expected cost of flooding damage in a given region, including the cost of installing and maintaining interventions. Our approach combines data-driven generation of storm surge fields, surrogate modeling of intervention impacts, and the solving of a continuous-armed bandit problem. We applied this methodology to optimize the selection of sea wall and oyster reef interventions near Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida, an area that was catastrophically impacted by Hurricane Michael. Our analysis predicts that intervention optimization could be used to potentially save billions of dollars in storm damage, far outpacing greedy or non-optimal solutions.

Abstract: Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\% of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.

Specifically, we formulate the posterior sampling problem as a regularized Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the latent space. We demonstrate the performance of our method on standard benchmarks using StableDiffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) as the prior.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Intelligent agents progress by continually refining their capabilities through actively exploring environments. Yet robot policies often lack sufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods that encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are unsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a framework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic manipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant factors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring safety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with arbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without degrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space enables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and controllability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher task success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample efficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled approach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website: https://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE

Abstract: Audio-based pedestrian detection is a challenging task and has, thus far, only been explored in noise-limited environments. We present a new dataset, results, and a detailed analysis of the state-of-the-art in audio-based pedestrian detection in the presence of vehicular noise. In our study, we conduct three analyses: (i) cross-dataset evaluation between noisy and noise-limited environments, (ii) an assessment of the impact of noisy data on model performance, highlighting the influence of acoustic context, and (iii) an evaluation of the model's predictive robustness on out-of-domain sounds. The new dataset is a comprehensive 1321-hour roadside dataset. It incorporates traffic-rich soundscapes. Each recording includes 16kHz audio synchronized with frame-level pedestrian annotations and 1fps video thumbnails.

Abstract: Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the diminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still, training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world. In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks, pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.

Abstract: Potential games are arguably one of the most important and widely studied classes of normal form games. They define the archetypal setting of multi-agent coordination as all agent utilities are perfectly aligned with each other via a common potential function. Can this intuitive framework be transplanted in the setting of Markov Games? What are the similarities and differences between multi-agent coordination with and without state dependence? We present a novel definition of Markov Potential Games (MPG) that generalizes prior attempts at capturing complex stateful multi-agent coordination. Counter-intuitively, insights from normal-form potential games do not carry over as MPGs can consist of settings where state-games can be zero-sum games. In the opposite direction, Markov games where every state-game is a potential game are not necessarily MPGs. Nevertheless, MPGs showcase standard desirable properties such as the existence of deterministic Nash policies. In our main technical result, we prove fast convergence of independent policy gradient to Nash policies by adapting recent gradient dominance property arguments developed for single agent MDPs to multi-agent learning settings.

Abstract: \kmeans clustering is a fundamental problem in many scientific and engineering domains. The optimization problem associated with \kmeans clustering is nonconvex, for which standard algorithms are only guaranteed to find a local optimum. Leveraging the hidden structure of local solutions, we propose a general algorithmic framework for escaping undesirable local solutions and recovering the global solution or the ground truth clustering. This framework consists of iteratively alternating between two steps: (i) detect mis-specified clusters in a local solution, and (ii) improve the local solution by non-local operations. We discuss specific implementation of these steps, and elucidate how the proposed framework unifies many existing variants of \kmeans algorithms through a geometric perspective. We also present two natural variants of the proposed framework, where the initial number of clusters may be over- or under-specified. We provide theoretical justifications and extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Deep Ensembles (DE) are a prominent approach for achieving excellent performance on key metrics such as accuracy, calibration, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution detection. However, hardware limitations of real-world systems constrain to smaller ensembles and lower-capacity networks, significantly deteriorating their performance and properties. We introduce Packed-Ensembles (PE), a strategy to design and train lightweight structured ensembles by carefully modulating the dimension of their encoding space. We leverage grouped convolutions to parallelize the ensemble into a single shared backbone and forward pass to improve training and inference speeds. PE is designed to operate within the memory limits of a standard neural network. Our extensive research indicates that PE accurately preserves the properties of DE, such as diversity, and performs equally well in terms of accuracy, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and robustness to distribution shift. We make our code available at https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS/torch-uncertainty.

<title>Is Pre-training Truly Better Than Meta-Learning?</title>

Abstract: In the context of few-shot learning, it is currently believed that a fixed pre-trained (PT) model, along with fine-tuning the final layer during evaluation, outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms. We re-evaluate these claims under an in-depth empirical examination of an extensive set of formally diverse datasets and compare PT to Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Unlike previous work, we emphasize a fair comparison by using: the same architecture, the same optimizer, and all models trained to convergence. Crucially, we use a more rigorous statistical tool -- the effect size (Cohen's d) -- to determine the practical significance of the difference between a model trained with PT vs. a MAML. We then use a previously proposed metric -- the diversity coefficient -- to compute the average formal diversity of a dataset. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the following: 1. when the formal diversity of a data set is low, PT beats MAML on average and 2. when the formal diversity is high, MAML beats PT on average. The caveat is that the magnitude of the average difference between a PT vs. MAML using the effect size is low (according to classical statistical thresholds) -- less than 0.2. Nevertheless, this observation is contrary to the currently held belief that a pre-trained model is always better than a meta-learning model. Our extensive experiments consider 21 few-shot learning benchmarks, including the large-scale few-shot learning dataset Meta-Data set. We also show no significant difference between a MAML model vs. a PT model with GPT-2 on Openwebtext. We, therefore, conclude that a pre-trained model does not always beat a meta-learned model and that the formal diversity of a dataset is a driving factor.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models relies heavily on the quality of input data, yet real-world applications often face significant data-related challenges. A common issue arises when curating training data or deploying models: two datasets from the same domain may exhibit differing distributions. While many techniques exist for detecting such distribution shifts, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to explain these differences in a human-understandable way beyond opaque quantitative metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a versatile framework of interpretable methods for comparing datasets. Using a variety of case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse data modalities-including tabular data, text data, images, time-series signals -- in both low and high-dimensional settings. These methods complement existing techniques by providing actionable and interpretable insights to better understand and address distribution shifts.

Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path and decompose the tracking error of the algorithm's output for the regularization path into random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences. Investigating the mean square asymptotic stability of the equations, we show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying, then the algorithm's output achieves mean square consistency with the regularization path. Leveraging operator theory, particularly the monotonicity of the inverses of operators and the spectral decomposition of compact operators, we introduce the RKHS persistence of excitation condition (i.e. there exists a fixed-length time period, such that the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every period has a uniformly strictly positive compact lower bound) and develop a dominated convergence method to prove the mean square consistency between the algorithm's output and an unknown function. Finally, for independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency if the input data's marginal probability measures are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.

Abstract: Linearization of attention using various kernel approximation and kernel learning techniques has shown promise. Past methods used a subset of combinations of component functions and weight matrices within the random feature paradigm. We identify the need for a systematic comparison of different combinations of weight matrices and component functions for attention learning in Transformer. Hence, we introduce Spectraformer, a unified framework for approximating and learning the kernel function in the attention mechanism of the Transformer. Our empirical results demonstrate, for the first time, that a random feature-based approach can achieve performance comparable to top-performing sparse and low-rank methods on the challenging Long Range Arena benchmark. Thus, we establish a new state-of-the-art for random feature-based efficient Transformers. The framework also produces many variants that offer different advantages in accuracy, training time, and memory consumption. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/spectraformer .

Abstract: Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science. The data downloading and associated analysis scripts are available at https://github.com/jessicafry/TIDMAD

Abstract: When applying nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), the rank parameter is generally unknown. This rank, called the nonnegative rank, is usually estimated heuristically since computing its exact value is NP-hard. In this work, we propose an approximation method to estimate the rank on-the-fly while solving NMF. We use the sum-of-norm (SON), a group-lasso structure that encourages pairwise sim- ilarity, to reduce the rank of a factor matrix when the initial rank is overestimated. On various datasets, SON-NMF can reveal the correct nonnegative rank of the data without prior knowledge or parameter tuning. SON-NMF is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, non-separable, and non-proximable problem, making it nontrivial to solve. First, since rank estimation in NMF is NP-hard, the proposed approach does not benefit from lower computational com- plexity. Using a graph-theoretic argument, we prove that the complexity of SON- NMF is essentially irreducible. Second, the per-iteration cost of algorithms for SON-NMF can be high. This motivates us to propose a first-order BCD algorithm that approximately solves SON-NMF with low per-iteration cost via the proximal average operator. SON-NMF exhibits favorable features for applications. Besides the ability to automatically estimate the rank from data, SON-NMF can handle rank-deficient data matrices and detect weak components with small energy. Furthermore, in hyperspectral imaging, SON-NMF naturally addresses the issue of spectral variability.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.

Abstract: Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.

Abstract: The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer a model to explain its behaviors. While recent studies have focused on the static mechanism of a certain behavior, the learning dynamics inside a model remain to be explored. In this work, we develop a fine-tuning method for analyzing the mechanism behind learning. Inspired by the concept of intrinsic dimension, we view a model as a computational graph with redundancy for a specific task, and treat the fine-tuning process as a search for and optimization of a subgraph within this graph. Based on this hypothesis, we propose circuit-tuning, an algorithm that iteratively builds the subgraph for a specific task and updates the relevant parameters in a heuristic way. We first validate our hypothesis through a carefully designed experiment and provide a detailed analysis of the learning dynamics during fine-tuning. Subsequently, we conduct experiments on more complex tasks, demonstrating that circuit-tuning could strike a balance between the performance on the target task and the general capabilities. Our work offers a new analytical method for the dynamics of fine-tuning, provides new findings on the mechanisms behind the training process, and inspires the design of superior algorithms for the training of neural networks.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generally exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high inter-subject variability, making generalization across subjects and domains challenging. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly self-supervised learning with Transformer-based architectures, have shown promise in EEG representation learning. However, their quadratic computational complexity increases memory usage and slows inference, making them inefficient for modeling long-range dependencies. Moreover, most existing approaches emphasize either explicit window segmentation of the temporal signal or spectral-only input embedding while neglecting raw temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 adopts a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture integrated with Mamba-2 to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby reducing memory usage and improving inference speed. Meanwhile, the selective information propagation mechanism of Mamba-2 enables the model to effectively capture and preserve long-range dependencies in raw EEG signals, where traditional RNN or CNN architectures often struggle. Moreover, EEGM2 employs a self-supervised pre-training objective that reconstructs raw EEG using a combined L1 and spectral (Fourier-based) loss, enhancing generalization by jointly preserving temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that EEGM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-sequence modeling and classification. Further evaluations show that EEGM2 consistently outperforms existing models, demonstrating strong generalization across subjects and tasks, as well as transferability across domains. Overall, EEGM2 offers an efficient and scalable solution suitable for deployment on resource-constrained brain-computer interface (BCI) devices.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhances model performance while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. Conventional mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures suffer from suboptimal coordination dynamics, where isolated expert operations expose the model to overfitting risks. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention blocks, which limits further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes the transformer model into an equivalent group of experts and applies a hierarchical routing mechanism to allocate input subspaces to specialized experts. Our approach advances MoE design with four key innovations: (1) Constructing expert groups by partitioning non-MoE models into functionally equivalent specialists (2) Developing a hierarchical routing paradigm that integrates patch-wise data selection and expert selection strategies. (3) Extending the MoE design to attention blocks. (4) Proposing a hardware-optimized parallelization scheme that exploits batched matrix multiplications for efficient expert computation. The experiments demonstrate that our UoE model surpasses Full Attention, state-of-the-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In language modeling tasks, UoE achieves an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity compared to the best-performing MoE method with only 76% of its FLOPs. In the Long Range Arena benchmark, it demonstrates an average score at least 0.68% higher than all comparison models, with only 50% of the FLOPs of the best MoE method. In image classification, it yields an average accuracy improvement of 1.75% over the best model while maintaining comparable FLOPs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of SAEs for interpreting and understanding the internal workings of LLMs. Our major contributions include: (1) exploring the technical framework of SAEs, covering basic architecture, design improvements, and effective training strategies; (2) examining different approaches to explaining SAE features, categorized into input-based and output-based explanation methods; (3) discussing evaluation methods for assessing SAE performance, covering both structural and functional metrics; and (4) investigating real-world applications of SAEs in understanding and manipulating LLM behaviors.

Abstract: Laplacian-based methods are popular for the dimensionality reduction of data lying in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Several theoretical results for these algorithms depend on the fact that the Euclidean distance locally approximates the geodesic distance on the underlying submanifold which the data are assumed to lie on. However, for some applications, other metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance, may provide a more appropriate notion of distance than the Euclidean distance. We provide a framework that generalizes the problem of manifold learning to metric spaces and study when a metric satisfies sufficient conditions for the pointwise convergence of the graph Laplacian.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DARSLP, a simple gloss-free, transformer-based sign language production (SLP) framework that directly maps spoken-language text to sign pose sequences. We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from word-level text embeddings of the input sentence. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sserranw/ABG-NAS.

Abstract: Empirical and theoretical studies have shown that continuous low-loss paths can be constructed between independently trained neural network models. This phenomenon, known as mode connectivity, refers to the existence of such paths between distinct modes-i.e., well-trained solutions in parameter space. However, existing empirical methods are primarily effective for older and relatively simple architectures such as basic CNNs, VGG, and ResNet, raising concerns about their applicability to modern and structurally diverse models. In this work, we propose a new empirical algorithm for connecting independently trained modes that generalizes beyond traditional architectures and supports a broader range of networks, including MobileNet, ShuffleNet, EfficientNet, RegNet, Deep Layer Aggregation (DLA), and Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT). In addition to broader applicability, the proposed method yields more consistent connectivity paths across independently trained mode pairs and supports connecting modes obtained with different training hyperparameters.

<title>Beyond Input Activations: Identifying Influential Latents by Gradient Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models (LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side gradient information.

Abstract: AI spans from large language models to tiny models running on microcontrollers (MCUs). Extremely memory-efficient model architectures are decisive to fit within an MCU's tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. However, inference latency must remain small to fit real-time constraints. An approach to tackle this is patch-based fusion, which aims to optimize data flows across neural network layers. In this paper, we introduce msf-CNN, a novel technique that efficiently finds optimal fusion settings for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by walking through the fusion solution space represented as a directed acyclic graph. Compared to previous work on CNN fusion for MCUs, msf-CNN identifies a wider set of solutions. We published an implementation of msf-CNN running on various microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32). We show that msf-CNN can achieve inference using 50% less RAM compared to the prior art (MCUNetV2 and StreamNet). We thus demonstrate how msf-CNN offers additional flexibility for system designers.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis. Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to \latencyimprv end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at \href{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}.

Abstract: The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip, early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks, combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%), the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime, achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However, in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot learning. DMPEL progressively builds a low-rank expert library and employs a lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy, enabling flexible and efficient lifelong forward transfer. Furthermore, by leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce expert coefficient replay, which guides the router to accurately retrieve frozen experts for previously encountered tasks. This technique mitigates forgetting while being significantly more storage- and computation-efficient than experience replay over the entire policy. Extensive experiments on the lifelong robot learning benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates during continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3 provides registration, the code for our sampling regime, and experimental results.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Learning representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs is critical for dynamic link prediction. While recent methods have become increasingly complex, the field lacks a strong and informative baseline to reliably gauge progress. This paper proposes HyperEvent, a simple approach that captures relative structural patterns in event sequences through an intuitive encoding mechanism. As a straightforward baseline, HyperEvent leverages relative structural encoding to identify meaningful event sequences without complex parameterization. By combining these interpretable features with a lightweight transformer classifier, HyperEvent reframes link prediction as event structure recognition. Despite its simplicity, HyperEvent achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, often matching the performance of more complex models. This work demonstrates that effective modeling can be achieved through simple structural encoding, providing a clear reference point for evaluating future advancements.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL), as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards. Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information in Safe RL. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer (PIGDreamer), a model-based RL approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that PIGDreamer significantly outperforms existing Safe RL methods. Furthermore, compared to alternative privileged RL methods, our approach exhibits enhanced performance, robustness, and efficiency. Codes are available at: https://github.com/hggforget/PIGDreamer.

However, extracting general chemical insight while balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that combines compressed higher-order topological signals with standard molecular features. Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across almost all benchmarks. We open source all code \footnote{All code and results can be found on Github https://github.com/rahulkhorana/TFC-PACT-Net}.

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Comet models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study of medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Consequently, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, Comet autoregressively predicts the next medical event to simulate patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, Comet generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. Comet's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that Comet, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

<title>Hierarchical Evaluation Function: A Multi-Metric Approach for Optimizing Demand Forecasting Models</title>

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for effective inventory management in dynamic and competitive environments, where decisions are influenced by uncertainty, financial constraints, and logistical limitations. Traditional evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) provide complementary perspectives but may lead to biased assessments when applied individually. To address this limitation, we propose the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF), a composite function that integrates R2, MAE, and RMSE within a hierarchical and adaptive framework. The function incorporates dynamic weights, tolerance thresholds derived from the statistical properties of the series, and progressive penalty mechanisms to ensure robustness against extreme errors and invalid predictions. HEF was implemented to optimize multiple forecasting models using Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and tested on benchmark datasets including Walmart, M3, M4, and M5. Experimental results, validated through statistical tests, demonstrate that HEF consistently outperforms MAE as an evaluation function in global metrics such as R2, Global Relative Accuracy (GRA), RMSE, and RMSSE, thereby providing greater explanatory power, adaptability, and stability. While MAE retains advantages in simplicity and efficiency, HEF proves more effective for long-term planning and complex contexts. Overall, HEF constitutes a robust and adaptive alternative for model selection and hyperparameter optimization in highly variable demand forecasting environments.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question: do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable probe of constructive scientific discovery. The idea is to systematically remove a target result together with its forget-closure (supporting lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop entailments) and then evaluate whether the model can re-derive the result from only permitted axioms and tools. Success would indicate generative capability beyond recall; failure would expose current limits. Unlike prevailing motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We outline a minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms to illustrate feasibility, and sketch how the same approach could later be extended to domains such as physics or chemistry. This is a position paper: our contribution is conceptual and methodological, not empirical. We aim to stimulate discussion on how principled ablation tests could help distinguish models that reconstruct knowledge from those that merely retrieve it, and how such probes might guide the next generation of AI-for-Science benchmarks.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their potential in graph machine learning remains largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. While many works on GFMs have focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) like TabPFNv2 or LimiX, we propose G2T-FM, a simple framework for turning tabular foundation models into graph foundation models. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies a TFM to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing competitively with, and often better than, well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines. In particular, when combined with LimiX, G2T-FM often outperforms the best GNN by a significant margin. In summary, our paper reveals the potential of a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However, existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1) heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters to repair local components which improves both client and global model performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the presence of modality incompleteness.

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource. CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards, with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on advancing clinical AI.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive theory showing that probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural networks. Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction, $\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation, and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and deep learning.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.

Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.

Abstract: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.

Abstract: We conducted an experiment during the review process of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), asking authors with multiple submissions to rank their papers based on perceived quality. In total, we received 1,342 rankings, each from a different author, covering 2,592 submissions. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how author-provided rankings could be leveraged to improve peer review processes at machine learning conferences. We focus on the Isotonic Mechanism, which calibrates raw review scores using the author-provided rankings. Our analysis shows that these ranking-calibrated scores outperform the raw review scores in estimating the ground truth ``expected review scores'' in terms of both squared and absolute error metrics. Furthermore, we propose several cautious, low-risk applications of the Isotonic Mechanism and author-provided rankings in peer review, including supporting senior area chairs in overseeing area chairs' recommendations, assisting in the selection of paper awards, and guiding the recruitment of emergency reviewers.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a complex group of eye diseases marked by optic nerve damage, commonly linked to elevated intraocular pressure and biomarkers like retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Understanding how these biomarkers interact is crucial for unraveling glaucoma's underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we propose GlaLSTM, a novel concurrent LSTM stream framework for glaucoma detection, leveraging latent biomarker relationships. Unlike traditional CNN-based models that primarily detect glaucoma from images, GlaLSTM provides deeper interpretability, revealing the key contributing factors and enhancing model transparency. This approach not only improves detection accuracy but also empowers clinicians with actionable insights, facilitating more informed decision-making. Experimental evaluations confirm that GlaLSTM surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential for both advanced biomarker analysis and reliable glaucoma detection.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. Our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Machine learning was employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from brain network at different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.

Abstract: For decades, classical point process models, such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, have been widely used for forecasting the event times and locations of earthquakes. Recent advances have led to Neural Point Processes (NPPs), which promise greater flexibility and improvements over such classical models. However, the currently-used benchmark for NPPs does not represent an up-to-date challenge in the seismological community, since it contains data leakage and omits the largest earthquake sequence from the region. Additionally, initial earthquake forecasting benchmarks fail to compare NPPs with state-of-the-art forecasting models commonly used in seismology. To address these gaps, we introduce EarthquakeNPP: a collection of benchmark datasets to facilitate testing of NPPs on earthquake data, accompanied by an implementation of the state-of-the-art forecasting model: ETAS. The datasets cover a range of small to large target regions within California, dating from 1971 to 2021, and include different methodologies for dataset generation. Benchmarking experiments, using both log-likelihood and generative evaluation metrics widely recognised in seismology, show that none of the five NPPs tested outperform ETAS. These findings suggest that current NPP implementations are not yet suitable for practical earthquake forecasting. Nonetheless, EarthquakeNPP provides a platform to foster future collaboration between the seismology and machine learning communities.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ModelKinship.

Abstract: We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.

arXiv:2411.08019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present sequence-driven structural causal models (SD-SCMs), a framework for specifying causal models with user-defined structure and language-model-defined mechanisms. We characterize how an SD-SCM enables sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired causal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of benchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level counterfactual data to test treatment effect estimation. We create an example benchmark consisting of thousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect estimation. We find under this benchmark that (1) causal methods outperform non-causal methods and that (2) even state-of-the-art methods struggle with individualized effect estimation, suggesting this benchmark captures some inherent difficulties in causal estimation. Apart from generating data, this same technique can underpin the auditing of language models for (un)desirable causal effects, such as misinformation or discrimination. We believe SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would benefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains, but their application to multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset for multi-omics biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules. This dataset bridges LLMs and complex biological sequence-related tasks, enhancing their versatility and reasoning while maintaining conversational fluency. We also highlight significant limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs on multi-omics tasks without specialized training. To overcome this, we propose ChatMultiOmics, a strong baseline with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating superior biological understanding through Biology-Instructions. Both resources are publicly available, paving the way for better integration of LLMs in multi-omics analysis. The Biology-Instructions is publicly available at: https://github.com/hhnqqq/Biology-Instructions.

Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) have emerged as an efficient tool for simulating quantum circuits due to their capacity to exploit data redundancies in quantum states and quantum operations, enabling the efficient computation of probability amplitudes. However, their application in quantum machine learning (QML) has remained unexplored. This paper introduces variational decision diagrams (VDDs), a novel graph structure that combines the structural benefits of DDs with the adaptability of variational methods for efficiently representing quantum states. We investigate the trainability of VDDs by applying them to the ground state estimation problem for transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Analysis of gradient variance suggests that training VDDs is possible, as no signs of vanishing gradients--also known as barren plateaus--are observed. This work provides new insights into the use of decision diagrams in QML as an alternative to design and train variational ans\"atze.

Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.

Abstract: The optimization foundations of deep linear networks have recently received significant attention. However, due to their inherent non-convexity and hierarchical structure, analyzing the loss functions of deep linear networks remains a challenging task. In this work, we study the local geometric landscape of the regularized squared loss of deep linear networks around each critical point. Specifically, we derive a closed-form characterization of the critical point set and establish an error bound for the regularized loss under mild conditions on network width and regularization parameters. Notably, this error bound quantifies the distance from a point to the critical point set in terms of the current gradient norm, which can be used to derive linear convergence of first-order methods. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments and demonstrate that gradient descent converges linearly to a critical point when optimizing the regularized loss of deep linear networks.

arXiv:2502.13329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The text produced by language models (LMs) can exhibit specific `behaviors,' such as a failure to follow alignment training, that we hope to detect and react to during deployment. Identifying these behaviors can often only be done post facto, i.e., after the entire text of the output has been generated. We provide evidence that there are times when we can predict how an LM will behave early in computation, before even a single token is generated. We show that probes trained on the internal representation of input tokens alone can predict a wide range of eventual behaviors over the entire output sequence. Using methods from conformal prediction, we provide provable bounds on the estimation error of our probes, creating precise early warning systems for these behaviors. The conformal probes can identify instances that will trigger alignment failures (jailbreaking) and instruction-following failures, without requiring a single token to be generated. An early warning system built on the probes reduces jailbreaking by 91%. Our probes also show promise in pre-emptively estimating how confident the model will be in its response, a behavior that cannot be detected using the output text alone. Conformal probes can preemptively estimate the final prediction of an LM that uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, hence accelerating inference. When applied to an LM that uses CoT to perform text classification, the probes drastically reduce inference costs (65% on average across 27 datasets), with negligible accuracy loss. Encouragingly, probes generalize to unseen datasets and perform better on larger models, suggesting applicability to the largest of models in real-world settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code is released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.

arXiv:2502.15855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models provide a promising approach to de novo 3D peptide design. Most of them jointly model the distributions of peptide's position, orientation, and conformation, attempting to simultaneously converge to the target pocket. However, in the early stage of docking, optimizing conformation-only modalities such as rotation and torsion can be physically meaningless, as the peptide is initialized far from the protein pocket and no interaction field is present. We define this problem as the multimodal temporal inconsistency problem and claim it is a key factor contributing to low binding affinity in generated peptides. To address this challenge, we propose THFlow, a novel flow matching-based multimodal generative model that explicitly models the temporal hierarchy between peptide position and conformation. It employs a polynomial based conditional flow to accelerate positional convergence early on, and later aligns it with rotation and torsion for coordinated conformation refinement under the emerging interaction field. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related features, such as polarity, to further enhance the model's understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering an effective and accurate solution for advancing peptide-based therapeutic development.

Abstract: Source localization in graph information propagation is essential for mitigating network disruptions, including misinformation spread, cyber threats, and infrastructure failures. Existing deep generative approaches face significant challenges in real-world applications due to limited propagation data availability. We present SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a generative diffusion framework that leverages topology-aware priors to enable robust source localization with limited data. SIDSL addresses three key challenges: unknown propagation patterns through structure-based source estimations via graph label propagation, complex topology-propagation relationships via a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with GNN-parameterized label propagation module, and class imbalance through structure-prior biased diffusion initialization. By learning pattern-invariant features from synthetic data generated by established propagation models, SIDSL enables effective knowledge transfer to real-world scenarios. Experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates superior performance with 7.5-13.3\% F1 score improvements over baselines, including over 19\% improvement in few-shot and 40\% in zero-shot settings, validating the framework's effectiveness for practical source localization. Our code can be found \href{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SIDSL}{here}.

arXiv:2502.20475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To answer one-to-many factual queries (e.g., listing cities of a country), a language model (LM) must simultaneously recall knowledge and avoid repeating previous answers. How are these two subtasks implemented and integrated internally? Across multiple datasets, models, and prompt templates, we identify a promote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then suppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject and previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention propagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention attends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the suppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental evidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze how components use different tokens by introducing both Token Lens, which decodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout method that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to specified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal components interact with different input tokens to support complex factual recall.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they often fail to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that rely on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we find that current layer-localized KE approaches (e.g., MEMIT, WISE), which edit only single or a few model layers, inadequately integrate updated knowledge into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we present CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enhances the effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. By only leveraging a few curated data samples guided by our circuit-based analysis, CaKE stimulates the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly incorporated knowledge. Experiments show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of edited knowledge across related reasoning tasks, achieving an average improvement of 20% in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on the MQuAKE dataset while requiring less memory than existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.

Abstract: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often compromises their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.

However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.

Abstract: We introduce SupertonicTTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for efficient and streamlined speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. The TTS pipeline is further simplified by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we propose context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment with minimal memory and I/O overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS delivers performance comparable to contemporary zero-shot TTS models with only 44M parameters, while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational cost. Audio samples are available at: https://supertonictts.github.io/.

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance'' property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

<title>Phantora: Maximizing Code Reuse in Simulation-based Machine Learning System Performance Estimation</title>

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) training workloads place substantial demands on both computational and communication resources. Consequently, accurate performance estimation has become increasingly critical for guiding system design decisions, such as the selection of parallelization strategies, cluster configurations, and hardware provisioning. Existing simulation-based performance estimation requires reimplementing the ML framework in a simulator, which demands significant manual effort and is hard to maintain as ML frameworks evolve rapidly.
  This paper introduces Phantora, a hybrid GPU cluster simulator designed for performance estimation of ML training workloads. Phantora executes unmodified ML frameworks as is within a distributed, containerized environment. Each container emulates the behavior of a GPU server in a large-scale cluster, while Phantora intercepts and simulates GPU- and communication-related operations to provide high-fidelity performance estimation. We call this approach hybrid simulation of ML systems, in contrast to traditional methods that simulate static workloads. The primary advantage of hybrid simulation is that it allows direct reuse of ML framework source code in simulation, avoiding the need for reimplementation. Our evaluation shows that Phantora provides accuracy comparable to static workload simulation while supporting three state-of-the-art LLM training frameworks out-of-the-box. In addition, Phantora operates on a single GPU, eliminating the need for the resource-intensive trace collection and workload extraction steps required by traditional trace-based simulators. Phantora is open-sourced at https://github.com/QDelta/Phantora.

Abstract: Few-shot relational learning on knowledge graph (KGs) aims to perform reasoning over relations with only a few training examples. While current methods have focused primarily on leveraging specific relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose PromptMeta, a novel prompted meta-learning framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta introduces two core innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics shared across tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion mechanism that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized jointly with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments and analyses on two real-world KG benchmarks validate the effectiveness of PromptMeta in adapting to new relations with limited supervision.

Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 53.4$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.

<title>Can Global XAI Methods Reveal Injected Bias in LLMs? SHAP vs Rule Extraction vs RuleSHAP</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can amplify misinformation, undermining societal goals like the UN SDGs. We study three documented drivers of misinformation (valence framing, information overload, and oversimplification) which are often shaped by one's default beliefs. Building on evidence that LLMs encode such defaults (e.g., "joy is positive," "math is complex") and can act as "bags of heuristics," we ask: can general belief-driven heuristics behind misinformative behaviour be recovered from LLMs as clear rules? A key obstacle is that global rule-extraction methods in explainable AI (XAI) are built for numerical inputs/outputs, not text. We address this by eliciting global LLM beliefs and mapping them to numerical scores via statistically reliable abstractions, thereby enabling off-the-shelf global XAI to detect belief-related heuristics in LLMs. To obtain ground truth, we hard-code bias-inducing nonlinear heuristics of increasing complexity (univariate, conjunctive, nonconvex) into popular LLMs (ChatGPT and Llama) via system instructions. This way, we find that RuleFit under-detects non-univariate biases, while global SHAP better approximates conjunctive ones but does not yield actionable rules. To bridge this gap, we propose RuleSHAP, a rule-extraction algorithm that couples global SHAP-value aggregations with rule induction to better capture non-univariate bias, improving heuristics detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average. Our results provide a practical pathway for revealing belief-driven biases in LLMs.

<title>Losing is for Cherishing: Data Valuation Based on Machine Unlearning and Shapley Value</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

arXiv:2505.17091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of {Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.5 billion items.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument. Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario, weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate this taxonomy.

arXiv:2506.12996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in zero-shot and single step reasoning and decision making problems, but in long horizon sequential planning tasks, their errors compound, often leading to unreliable or inefficient behavior. We introduce LogicGuard, a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by a trajectory level LLM critic that communicates through Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. LogicGuard supports both fixed safety rules and adaptive, learned constraints, and is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, with LogicGuard acting as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LogicGuard to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. To demonstrate generality, we evaluate LogicGuard across two distinct settings: short-horizon general tasks and long-horizon specialist tasks. On the Behavior benchmark of 100 household tasks, LogicGuard increases task completion rates by 25% over a baseline InnerMonologue planner. On the Minecraft diamond-mining task, which is long-horizon and requires multiple interdependent subgoals, LogicGuard improves both efficiency and safety compared to SayCan and InnerMonologue. These results show that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through temporal logic yields more reliable, efficient and safe decision-making for both embodied agents.

arXiv:2507.03689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional feature maps, for encoding data onto a quantum circuit are currently impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a quantum feature map designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization when using our feature map as a kernel for characterization, as compared to state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulation results, combined with lower resource requirements, highlight our map's ability to function within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. While quantum kernels are typically stymied by exponential concentration, our approach is affected with a slower rate with respect to both the number of qubits and features, which allows practical applications to remain within reach. Our findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.

arXiv:2507.05470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a distribution-free framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals in nonstationary time series. TCP combines a quantile forecaster with split-conformal calibration on a rolling window and, in its TCP-RM variant, augments the conformal threshold with a Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer coverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and a rolling Quantile Regression (QR) baseline across equities (S&amp;P500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three consistent findings emerge. First, rolling QR produces the sharpest intervals but is materially under-calibrated (e.g., S&amp;P500: 86.3% vs. 95% target). Second, TCP and TCP-RM achieve near-nominal coverage while delivering substantially narrower intervals than Historical Simulation (e.g., S&amp;P500: 29% reduction in width). Third, the RM update improves calibration with negligible width cost. Crisis-window visualizations around March 2020 show TCP/TCP-RM expanding and contracting intervals promptly as volatility spikes and recedes, with red dots marking days of miscoverage. A sensitivity study confirms robustness to window size and step-size choices. Overall, TCP provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution for calibrated uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, bridging statistical inference and machine learning for risk forecasting.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations. To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e., operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of structure-aware sample quality assessment.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been applied to interpret deep learning model results. However, applications that integrate XAI with established hydrologic knowledge for process understanding remain limited. Here we show that XAI method, applied at point-scale, could be used for cross-scale aggregation of hydrologic responses, a fundamental question in scaling problems, using hydrologic connectivity as a demonstration. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based hydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, whose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that XAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the functional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI results could be considered as an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic connectivity development, offering insights to hydrological organization. This framework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other geophysical responses to advance process understandings.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

arXiv:2509.14001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance representation learning on graph-structured data. Inspired by classical mechanics, the method dynamically adjusts message passing by considering the features distance as a lever arm vector and neighbor features as a force vector weighted by homophily disparity. By defining torque in this way, the approach strategically prunes high-torque edges and adds low-torque links to optimize information diffusion. Through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing rewiring techniques on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs. This innovative approach shows promise for improving the efficiency of GNNs in processing native interactions within graphs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous and homophilous graphs. Specifically, we define the torque by treating the feature distance as a lever arm vector and the neighbor feature as a force vector weighted by the homophily disparity between nodes. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing the impact of irrelevant information and boosting pertinent signals during message passing. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art rewiring methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs.

Summary:<br />
As computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is crucial. Traditional RL methods struggle with decentralized distributed training due to tight coupling between parameter learning and rollout sampling. HeteroRL proposes a solution with GEPO, an asynchronous RL algorithm that addresses latency and heterogeneity issues. High latency increases variance in importance sampling weights and training instability, but GEPO mitigates this using group expectation weighting. The algorithm demonstrates superior stability, with minimal performance drop even with significant latency. This research shows promise for decentralized RL in geographically distributed, resource-heterogeneous computing environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training becomes essential. However, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, crucial for enhancing large model post-training, cannot adapt to decentralized distributed training due to the tight coupling between parameter learning and rollout sampling. For this, we propose HeteroRL, a heterogeneous RL architecture that decouples these processes, enabling stable training across geographically distributed nodes connected via the Internet. The core component is Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), an asynchronous RL algorithm robust to latency caused by network delays or heterogeneity in computational resources. Our study reveals that high latency significantly increases KL divergence, leading to higher variance in importance sampling weights and training instability. GEPO mitigates this issue by using group expectation weighting to exponentially reduce the variance of importance weights, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments show that GEPO achieves superior stability, with only a 3\% performance drop from online to 1800s latency, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in geographically distributed, resource-heterogeneous computing environments.

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs, prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

Summary:
Deceptive instructions can lead large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive responses, presenting safety challenges. By analyzing the internal representations of LLMs Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct on a factual verification task, researchers found that the model's output can be predicted using linear probes based on internal representations. Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts compared to truthful/neutral instructions, particularly in early-to-mid layers. These shifts are detectable even on complex datasets. Specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features sensitive to deception were identified, with targeted visualizations confirming distinct truthful/deceptive representational subspaces. This analysis provides insights for detecting and controlling deceptive instructions in LLMs, pinpointing layer-wise and feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed dishonesty in LLMs.

The study introduces a novel approach, LLM-CRDT, for optimizing UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation to maximize energy efficiency in data collection. The resource allocation problem is solved optimally using linear programming. LLM-CRDT integrates critic networks with a decision transformer model, combining sequence modeling and value guidance for policy learning from suboptimal datasets. The framework incorporates a pre-trained large language model as the transformer backbone and utilizes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, LoRA, for rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with limited data and computational resources. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms existing online and offline reinforcement learning methods, achieving significant improvements in energy efficiency for UAV data collection tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance, but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool for software optimization and performance improvement.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to accurately estimate dimensions of additively manufactured components. Using a dataset of 405 parts from nine production runs involving two machines, three polymer materials, and two-part configurations, we examine five key design features. To capture both design information and manufacturing variability, we employ models integrating continuous and categorical factors. For predicting Difference from Target (DFT) values, we test deterministic and probabilistic machine learning methods. Deterministic models, trained on 80% of the dataset, provide precise point estimates, with Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieving accuracy close to process repeatability. To address systematic deviations, we adopt Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). GPR delivers strong predictive performance and interpretability, while BNNs capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. We investigate two BNN approaches: one balancing accuracy and uncertainty capture, and another offering richer uncertainty decomposition but with lower dimensional accuracy. Our results underscore the importance of quantifying epistemic uncertainty for robust decision-making, risk assessment, and model improvement. We discuss trade-offs between GPR and BNNs in terms of predictive power, interpretability, and computational efficiency, noting that model choice depends on analytical needs. By combining deterministic precision with probabilistic uncertainty quantification, our study provides a rigorous foundation for uncertainty-aware predictive modeling in AM. This approach not only enhances dimensional accuracy but also supports reliable, risk-informed design strategies, thereby advancing data-driven manufacturing methodologies.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) aims to identify bioactive compounds from vast chemical libraries, but remains difficult in low-label regimes where only a few actives are known. Existing methods largely rely on general-purpose molecular fingerprints and overlook class-discriminative substructures critical to bioactivity. Moreover, they consider molecules independently, limiting effectiveness in low-label regimes. We introduce SubDyve, a network-based VS framework that constructs a subgraph-aware similarity network and propagates activity signals from a small known actives. When few active compounds are available, SubDyve performs iterative seed refinement, incrementally promoting new candidates based on local false discovery rate. This strategy expands the seed set with promising candidates while controlling false positives from topological bias and overexpansion. We evaluate SubDyve on ten DUD-E targets under zero-shot conditions and on the CDK7 target with a 10-million-compound ZINC dataset. SubDyve consistently outperforms existing fingerprint or embedding-based approaches, achieving margins of up to +34.0 on the BEDROC and +24.6 on the EF1% metric.

Summary:
Deep perception networks in autonomous driving are traditionally data-intensive but lack fundamental information-theoretic constraints. Researchers reconceptualize neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains to compress raw sensory inputs effectively. They establish two design principles for robust perception: smooth mutual information variation between layers and monotonic entropy decay with depth. These principles guide the development of Eloss, an entropy-based regularizer that enhances sensitivity to anomalies in sensor inputs. Experimental validation on 3D object detection benchmarks demonstrates Eloss's effectiveness in improving accuracy while amplifying distribution-shift signals. This approach improves interpretability, enhances anomaly detection, and establishes a theoretical foundation for safer autonomous driving perception systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep perception networks in autonomous driving traditionally rely on data-intensive training regimes and post-hoc anomaly detection, often disregarding fundamental information-theoretic constraints governing stable information processing. We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.

<div> Pooling, vertices, fuzzy, neural networks, efficiency
Summary:
The document introduces the concept of fuzzy vertex pooling (FVP) in the context of neural networks. FVP involves creating a new vertex that connects to all vertices originally adjacent to the endpoints of pooled vertices, followed by the removal of these endpoints and connected edges. The pooling model shows rapid loss minimization and competitive accuracy with fewer hidden layer neurons. However, its effectiveness decreases over time and with larger datasets, leading to performance degradation in later stages of deep learning training. As a result, pooling is recommended for early-stage training in advanced deep learning models to capitalize on its initial efficiency. <div>

Abstract: The process of pooling vertices involves the creation of a new vertex, which becomes adjacent to all the vertices that were originally adjacent to the endpoints of the vertices being pooled. After this, the endpoints of these vertices and all edges connected to them are removed. In this document, we introduce a formal framework for the concept of fuzzy vertex pooling (FVP) and provide an overview of its key properties with its applications to neural networks. The pooling model demonstrates remarkable efficiency in minimizing loss rapidly while maintaining competitive accuracy, even with fewer hidden layer neurons. However, this advantage diminishes over extended training periods or with larger datasets, where the model's performance tends to degrade. This study highlights the limitations of pooling in later stages of deep learning training, rendering it less effective for prolonged or large-scale applications. Consequently, pooling is recommended as a strategy for early-stage training in advanced deep learning models to leverage its initial efficiency.

arXiv:2509.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.

Summary: 
This paper investigates the task of black-box optimization, where the goal is to find the maximum of a function using observed input-output pairs. The traditional approach involves learning a surrogate function from offline data. Alternatively, the task can be viewed as mapping desired performance to potential input candidates. This study introduces a novel perspective that frames offline optimization as a distributional translation task. It proposes learning a probabilistic bridge that transforms low-value inputs into high-value solution candidates. The technique involves constructing synthetic functions based on Gaussian processes fitted with different parameterizations on the offline data. By leveraging this approach, the study achieves significant improvement and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on a comprehensive benchmark of recent methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper studies the black-box optimization task which aims to find the maxima of a black-box function using a static set of its observed input-output pairs. This is often achieved via learning and optimizing a surrogate function with that offline data. Alternatively, it can also be framed as an inverse modeling task that maps a desired performance to potential input candidates that achieve it. Both approaches are constrained by the limited amount of offline data. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a new perspective that casts offline optimization as a distributional translation task. This is formulated as learning a probabilistic bridge transforming an implicit distribution of low-value inputs (i.e., offline data) into another distribution of high-value inputs (i.e., solution candidates). Such probabilistic bridge can be learned using low- and high-value inputs sampled from synthetic functions that resemble the target function. These synthetic functions are constructed as the mean posterior of multiple Gaussian processes fitted with different parameterizations on the offline data, alleviating the data bottleneck. The proposed approach is evaluated on an extensive benchmark comprising most recent methods, demonstrating significant improvement and establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel method for auto-bidding systems in advertising that takes into account uncertainty in the true value of ad impressions. By using conformal prediction and machine learning trained on historical data, the method quantifies this uncertainty without assuming the data are i.i.d. It enhances existing auto-bidding algorithms with budget and Return-on-Spend (RoS) constraints, providing performance guarantees without knowing the true value. The adjusted value estimator derived from machine learning predictions improves overall performance while keeping RoS violations low. The approach is demonstrated to be effective on both simulated and real-world industrial datasets, showing improved performance without sacrificing computational efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2509.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto-bidding systems are widely used in advertising to automatically determine bid values under constraints such as total budget and Return-on-Spend (RoS) targets. Existing works often assume that the value of an ad impression, such as the conversion rate, is known. This paper considers the more realistic scenario where the true value is unknown. We propose a novel method that uses conformal prediction to quantify the uncertainty of these values based on machine learning methods trained on historical bidding data with contextual features, without assuming the data are i.i.d. This approach is compatible with current industry systems that use machine learning to predict values. Building on prediction intervals, we introduce an adjusted value estimator derived from machine learning predictions, and show that it provides performance guarantees without requiring knowledge of the true value. We apply this method to enhance existing auto-bidding algorithms with budget and RoS constraints, and establish theoretical guarantees for achieving high reward while keeping RoS violations low. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that our approach improves performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on imbalanced regression with highly imbalanced tabular data, particularly in forecasting rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle events. The proposed CISIR approach combines correlation, Monotonically Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling to accurately estimate target values. Experimental results on five datasets show that CISIR outperforms recent methods, achieving lower error and higher correlation. Additionally, adding the correlation component to other methods improves their performance. The MDI importance function particularly stands out for its superior performance. The code for CISIR is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: We investigate imbalanced regression with tabular data that have an imbalance ratio larger than 1,000 ("highly imbalanced"). Accurately estimating the target values of rare instances is important in applications such as forecasting the intensity of rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For regression, the MSE loss does not consider the correlation between predicted and actual values. Typical inverse importance functions allow only convex functions. Uniform sampling might yield mini-batches that do not have rare instances. We propose CISIR that incorporates correlation, Monotonically Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling. Based on five datasets, our experimental results indicate that CISIR can achieve lower error and higher correlation than some recent methods. Also, adding our correlation component to other recent methods can improve their performance. Lastly, MDI importance can outperform other importance functions. Our code can be found in https://github.com/Machine-Earning/CISIR.

Summary: 
The study introduces UNIPHY+Lab, a framework combining a PPG foundation model with a patient-aware Mamba model to predict key laboratory tests in ICUs. The aim is to address challenges such as capturing extended temporal trends, accounting for patient-specific baseline variations, and performing multi-task estimation for biomarkers. Results indicate significant improvements in MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$ compared to LSTM and carry-forward baselines for most estimation targets. The research demonstrates the potential of continuous, personalized lab value estimation using routine PPG monitoring, paving the way for non-invasive biochemical surveillance in critical care settings. <div>
arXiv:2509.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical laboratory tests provide essential biochemical measurements for diagnosis and treatment, but are limited by intermittent and invasive sampling. In contrast, photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a non-invasive, continuously recorded signal in intensive care units (ICUs) that reflects cardiovascular dynamics and can serve as a proxy for latent physiological changes. We propose UNIPHY+Lab, a framework that combines a large-scale PPG foundation model for local waveform encoding with a patient-aware Mamba model for long-range temporal modeling. Our architecture addresses three challenges: (1) capturing extended temporal trends in laboratory values, (2) accounting for patient-specific baseline variation via FiLM-modulated initial states, and (3) performing multi-task estimation for interrelated biomarkers. We evaluate our method on the two ICU datasets for predicting the five key laboratory tests. The results show substantial improvements over the LSTM and carry-forward baselines in MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$ among most of the estimation targets. This work demonstrates the feasibility of continuous, personalized lab value estimation from routine PPG monitoring, offering a pathway toward non-invasive biochemical surveillance in critical care.

Abstract: Tabular data remain a dominant form of real-world information but pose persistent challenges for deep learning due to heterogeneous feature types, lack of natural structure, and limited label-preserving augmentations. As a result, ensemble models based on decision trees continue to dominate benchmark leaderboards. In this work, we introduce RuleNet, a transformer-based architecture specifically designed for deep tabular learning. RuleNet incorporates learnable rule embeddings in a decoder, a piecewise linear quantile projection for numerical features, and feature masking ensembles for robustness and uncertainty estimation. Evaluated on eight benchmark datasets, RuleNet matches or surpasses state-of-the-art tree-based methods in most cases, while remaining computationally efficient, offering a practical neural alternative for tabular prediction tasks.

<div> Diffusion Generative Model, Antibody Optimization, Protein Structure, Iterative Design, Therapeutic Antibodies<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a strategy for optimizing therapeutic antibody candidates through iterative design, leveraging sequence and structure as well as experimental measurements. A sequence-structure diffusion generative model is trained on antibody-antigen complexes to enable the optimization process. The approach utilizes predicted antibody-antigen complexes to optimize lead candidates during iterative design. A guided sampling technique biases generation towards desirable properties by incorporating models trained on experimental data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through in silico and in vitro experiments, showing the generation of high-affinity binders at various stages of an active antibody optimization campaign. <div>
arXiv:2509.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapeutic antibody candidates often require extensive engineering to improve key functional and developability properties before clinical development. This can be achieved through iterative design, where starting molecules are optimized over several rounds of in vitro experiments. While protein structure can provide a strong inductive bias, it is rarely used in iterative design due to the lack of structural data for continually evolving lead molecules over the course of optimization. In this work, we propose a strategy for iterative antibody optimization that leverages both sequence and structure as well as accumulating lab measurements of binding and developability. Building on prior work, we first train a sequence-structure diffusion generative model that operates on antibody-antigen complexes. We then outline an approach to use this model, together with carefully predicted antibody-antigen complexes, to optimize lead candidates throughout the iterative design process. Further, we describe a guided sampling approach that biases generation toward desirable properties by integrating models trained on experimental data from iterative design. We evaluate our approach in multiple in silico and in vitro experiments, demonstrating that it produces high-affinity binders at multiple stages of an active antibody optimization campaign.

EMPEROR encodes feature distributions using statistical moments, leveraging sliced moments theory. It projects features onto multiple directions, fits univariate Gaussian mixture models to each projection, and aggregates slice parameters into a compact descriptor. The framework ensures determinacy guarantees and derives finite-sample error bounds that scale optimally. Empirical results show EMPEROR captures richer distributional information compared to common pooling schemes across different data modalities, while remaining computationally efficient and widely applicable. <div>

Abstract: We introduce EMPEROR (Efficient Moment-Preserving Representation of Distributions), a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for representing high-dimensional probability measures arising in neural network representations. Unlike heuristic global pooling operations, EMPEROR encodes a feature distribution through its statistical moments. Our approach leverages the theory of sliced moments: features are projected onto multiple directions, lightweight univariate Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are fit to each projection, and the resulting slice parameters are aggregated into a compact descriptor. We establish determinacy guarantees via Carleman's condition and the Cram\'er-Wold theorem, ensuring that the GMM is uniquely determined by its sliced moments, and we derive finite-sample error bounds that scale optimally with the number of slices and samples. Empirically, EMPEROR captures richer distributional information than common pooling schemes across various data modalities, while remaining computationally efficient and broadly applicable.

Summary: 
Machine unlearning (MU) is a key process in removing specific data from a trained model while retaining knowledge of other data. Existing methods for MU have limitations in effectiveness. The CoUn framework introduces a novel approach inspired by retraining models using only selected data. CoUn utilizes contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning to adjust data representations, focusing on retaining data while indirectly adjusting forget data based on their semantic similarity. Extensive experiments show that CoUn outperforms current MU methods, consistently improving unlearning effectiveness. Integrating the CL module into existing methods further enhances their unlearning capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget" data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining "retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.

Summary:
Federated Learning (FL) was studied in the context of binary classification for volatile financial market trends. Three scenarios were compared: centralized model training on all data, single-agent model training on individual data subsets, and FL collaboration with privacy preservation. The study was extended to include additional market features, non-identically distributed data across agents, personalized FL, and differential privacy. Results showed that FL achieved accuracy and generalization similar to the centralized model while surpassing the single-agent model. Collaborative, privacy-preserving learning was shown to have value in finance, even with realistic data heterogeneity and personalization requirements. <div>

Abstract: This paper studies Federated Learning (FL) for binary classification of volatile financial market trends. Using a shared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier, we compare three scenarios: (i) a centralized model trained on the union of all data, (ii) a single-agent model trained on an individual data subset, and (iii) a privacy-preserving FL collaboration in which agents exchange only model updates, never raw data. We then extend the study with additional market features, deliberately introducing not independent and identically distributed data (non-IID) across agents, personalized FL and employing differential privacy. Our numerical experiments show that FL achieves accuracy and generalization on par with the centralized baseline, while significantly outperforming the single-agent model. The results show that collaborative, privacy-preserving learning provides collective tangible value in finance, even under realistic data heterogeneity and personalization requirements.

It outperforms ten baseline approaches across all evaluation scenarios, including synthetic rooms, EnergyPlus simulation, and real-world data from ASHRAE. Intervention scheduling with GRID results in low operational impact and reduced risk metrics compared to baseline methods.

arXiv:2509.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual HVAC fault diagnosis in commercial buildings takes 8-12 hours per incident and achieves only 60 percent diagnostic accuracy, reflecting analytics that stop at correlation instead of causation. To close this gap, we present GRID (Graph-based Reasoning for Intervention and Discovery), a three-stage causal discovery pipeline that combines constraint-based search, neural structural equation modeling, and language model priors to recover directed acyclic graphs from building sensor data. Across six benchmarks: synthetic rooms, EnergyPlus simulation, the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset, and a live office testbed, GRID achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.65 to 1.00, with exact recovery (F1 = 1.00) in three controlled environments (Base, Hidden, Physical) and strong performance on real-world data (F1 = 0.89 on ASHRAE, 0.86 in noisy conditions). The method outperforms ten baseline approaches across all evaluation scenarios. Intervention scheduling achieves low operational impact in most scenarios (cost <= 0.026) while reducing risk metrics compared to baseline approaches. The framework integrates constraint-based methods, neural architectures, and domain-specific language model prompts to address the observational-causal gap in building analytics.

<div> Conditional diffusion models, compositional generalization, length generalization, locality, conditional projective composition
Summary: 
Conditional diffusion models show the potential for compositional generalization, specifically in the context of length generalization in image generation tasks like CLEVR. The study explores the underlying mechanisms of this ability, focusing on the concept of locality as a structural mechanism for compositional generalization. The research establishes a connection between a specific compositional structure and scores with sparse dependencies, termed as "local conditional scores." Empirical validation confirms that models succeeding at length generalization exhibit local conditional scores. Additionally, a causal intervention enforcing local conditional scores improves length generalization in models that previously failed. The investigation also extends to feature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, providing initial evidence of compositional structure in the SDXL dataset. The findings contribute to understanding the factors influencing compositional generalization in conditional diffusion models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models appear capable of compositional generalization, i.e., generating convincing samples for out-of-distribution combinations of conditioners, but the mechanisms underlying this ability remain unclear. To make this concrete, we study length generalization, the ability to generate images with more objects than seen during training. In a controlled CLEVR setting (Johnson et al., 2017), we find that length generalization is achievable in some cases but not others, suggesting that models only sometimes learn the underlying compositional structure. We then investigate locality as a structural mechanism for compositional generalization. Prior works proposed score locality as a mechanism for creativity in unconditional diffusion models (Kamb & Ganguli, 2024; Niedoba et al., 2024), but did not address flexible conditioning or compositional generalization. In this paper, we prove an exact equivalence between a specific compositional structure ("conditional projective composition") (Bradley et al., 2025) and scores with sparse dependencies on both pixels and conditioners ("local conditional scores"). This theory also extends to feature-space compositionality. We validate our theory empirically: CLEVR models that succeed at length generalization exhibit local conditional scores, while those that fail do not. Furthermore, we show that a causal intervention explicitly enforcing local conditional scores restores length generalization in a previously failing model. Finally, we investigate feature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, and find preliminary evidence of compositional structure in SDXL.

It extends the identifiability result in the two-variable setting and presents the first identifiability result for causal graphs with more than two nodes.

Additionally, a heuristic algorithm is suggested for small graphs, showing strong empirical performance.

Finally, real-world datasets are used to test the performance of the algorithms, highlighting their effectiveness in practical applications. <div>

Abstract: Entropic causal inference is a recent framework for learning the causal graph between two variables from observational data by finding the information-theoretically simplest structural explanation of the data, i.e., the model with smallest entropy. In our work, we first extend the causal graph identifiability result in the two-variable setting under relaxed assumptions. We then show the first identifiability result using the entropic approach for learning causal graphs with more than two nodes. Our approach utilizes the property that ancestrality between a source node and its descendants can be determined using the bivariate entropic tests. We provide a sound sequential peeling algorithm for general graphs that relies on this property. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for small graphs that shows strong empirical performance. We rigorously evaluate the performance of our algorithms on synthetic data generated from a variety of models, observing improvement over prior work. Finally we test our algorithms on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising results in tabular data generation. However, inherent historical biases in tabular datasets often cause LLMs to exacerbate fairness issues, particularly when multiple advantaged and protected features are involved. In this work, we introduce a universal debiasing framework that minimizes group-level dependencies by simultaneously reducing the mutual information between advantaged and protected attributes. By leveraging the autoregressive structure and analytic sampling distributions of LLM-based tabular data generators, our approach efficiently computes mutual information, reducing the need for cumbersome numerical estimations. Building on this foundation, we propose two complementary methods: a direct preference optimization (DPO)-based strategy, namely UDF-DPO, that integrates seamlessly with existing models, and a targeted debiasing technique, namely UDF-MIX, that achieves debiasing without tuning the parameters of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively balances fairness and utility, offering a scalable and practical solution for debiasing in high-stakes applications.

<div> machine learning, urban structures, violent crime, perception of safety, New York City, Chicago 

Summary:
The study investigates how physical structures in urban areas impact crime rates and feelings of safety in New York City and Chicago. Using machine learning techniques to control for demographic factors, the researchers found that abandoned buildings and high foot traffic areas like public transportation hubs are associated with increased crime and heightened perceptions of danger, supporting the "broken windows" theory. However, these effects vary in magnitude, spatial distribution, and impact on different demographics between the two cities. The study highlights the need for tailored, specific interventions in urban crime prevention rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. <div>

Abstract: We revisit the longstanding question of how physical structures in urban landscapes influence crime. Leveraging machine learning-based matching techniques to control for demographic composition, we estimate the effects of several types of urban structures on the incidence of violent crime in New York City and Chicago. We additionally contribute to a growing body of literature documenting the relationship between perception of crime and actual crime rates by separately analyzing how the physical urban landscape shapes subjective feelings of safety. Our results are twofold. First, in consensus with prior work, we demonstrate a "broken windows" effect in which abandoned buildings, a sign of social disorder, are associated with both greater incidence of crime and a heightened perception of danger. This is also true of types of urban structures that draw foot traffic such as public transportation infrastructure. Second, these effects are not uniform within or across cities. The criminogenic effects of the same structure types across two cities differ in magnitude, degree of spatial localization, and heterogeneity across subgroups, while within the same city, the effects of different structure types are confounded by different demographic variables. Taken together, these results emphasize that one-size-fits-all approaches to crime reduction are untenable and policy interventions must be specifically tailored to their targets.

Summary: 
The article explores the impact of fine-tuning foundation models pretrained on physiological data, like PPG signals, on heart rate prediction and gender fairness. While fine-tuning improves prediction accuracy, it can worsen fairness gaps, especially with significant distributional shifts. The FairTune framework is introduced to address biases in fine-tuning, with strategies like class weighting and adversarial debiasing proving effective in reducing fairness gaps without sacrificing accuracy. Analysis shows that these mitigation techniques reshape internal embeddings to reduce demographic clustering. The study emphasizes that fairness is not inherent in fine-tuning and explicit mitigation strategies are crucial for equitable deployment of physiological foundation models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on physiological data such as photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are increasingly used to improve heart rate (HR) prediction across diverse settings. Fine-tuning these models for local deployment is often seen as a practical and scalable strategy. However, its impact on demographic fairness particularly under domain shifts remains underexplored. We fine-tune PPG-GPT a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on intensive care unit (ICU) data across three heterogeneous datasets (ICU, wearable, smartphone) and systematically evaluate the effects on HR prediction accuracy and gender fairness. While fine-tuning substantially reduces mean absolute error (up to 80%), it can simultaneously widen fairness gaps, especially in larger models and under significant distributional characteristics shifts. To address this, we introduce FairTune, a bias-aware fine-tuning framework in which we benchmark three mitigation strategies: class weighting based on inverse group frequency (IF), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO), and adversarial debiasing (ADV). We find that IF and GroupDRO significantly reduce fairness gaps without compromising accuracy, with effectiveness varying by deployment domain. Representation analyses further reveal that mitigation techniques reshape internal embeddings to reduce demographic clustering. Our findings highlight that fairness does not emerge as a natural byproduct of fine-tuning and that explicit mitigation is essential for equitable deployment of physiological foundation models.

Summary:
- The paper addresses the issue of model collapse in diffusion models due to recursive training on synthetic data.
- Model collapse is characterized by a transition from generalization to memorization, where models reproduce training data instead of generating novel content.
- The decline in entropy of synthetic training data drives this transition, indicating model degradation.
- An entropy-based data selection strategy is proposed to prevent the transition and alleviate model collapse.
- Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing model collapse.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of diffusion models has led to an abundance of AI-generated data, raising concerns about model collapse -- a phenomenon in which recursive iterations of training on synthetic data lead to performance degradation. Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance shrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical manifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from generalization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where models increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content during iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly driven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each training cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation. Motivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy to mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate model collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing collapse.

Summary:
Our research introduces a novel approach to address the challenges faced by existing graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models in mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). By training the graph retriever end-to-end with the LLM, we enable adaptive navigation of multi-hop relevant entities while filtering out noise. This approach incorporates structural knowledge and semantic features into the LLM's reasoning process, resulting in improved performance across three Question Answering benchmarks. Our framework eliminates the need for predefined ground-truth entities by optimizing the retriever using LLM logits as implicit feedback, making it particularly effective in open-domain settings. The joint optimization of the graph retriever and LLM leads to state-of-the-art performance, showcasing the strength of interactive training for complex reasoning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly mitigated the hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding the generation with external knowledge. Recent extensions of RAG to graph-based retrieval offer a promising direction, leveraging the structural knowledge for multi-hop reasoning. However, existing graph RAG typically decouples retrieval and reasoning processes, which prevents the retriever from adapting to the reasoning needs of the LLM. They also struggle with scalability when performing multi-hop expansion over large-scale graphs, or depend heavily on annotated ground-truth entities, which are often unavailable in open-domain settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph retriever trained end-to-end with LLM, which features an attention-based growing and pruning mechanism, adaptively navigating multi-hop relevant entities while filtering out noise. Within the extracted subgraph, structural knowledge and semantic features are encoded via soft tokens and the verbalized graph, respectively, which are infused into the LLM together, thereby enhancing its reasoning capability and facilitating interactive joint training of the graph retriever and the LLM reasoner. Experimental results across three QA benchmarks show that our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the strength of joint graph-LLM optimization for complex reasoning tasks. Notably, our framework eliminates the need for predefined ground-truth entities by directly optimizing the retriever using LLM logits as implicit feedback, making it especially effective in open-domain settings.

Summary: 
The article proposes a novel encoder architecture for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions in new knowledge domains. It introduces a frozen small language model (SLM) with a trainable adapter network to update encoders efficiently. A novel retrieval mechanism using a classifier head attached to the SLM encoder is also introduced to learn a similarity mapping. The use of federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) enables online fine-tuning of the encoder and retriever on resource-constrained edge devices. The methodology is theoretically analyzed for convergence guarantees and tested in numerical experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of obtaining soft embeddings, training the classifier, and leveraging FL for speedup. <div>
arXiv:2509.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions are intended to be used for new knowledge domains, it is necessary to update their encoders, which are taken to be pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, fully finetuning these large models is compute- and memory-intensive, and even infeasible when deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. We propose a novel encoder architecture in this work that addresses this limitation by using a frozen small language model (SLM), which satisfies the memory constraints of edge devices, and inserting a small adapter network before the transformer blocks of the SLM. The trainable adapter takes the token embeddings of the new corpus and learns to produce enhanced soft embeddings for it, while requiring significantly less compute power to update than full fine-tuning. We further propose a novel retrieval mechanism by attaching a classifier head to the SLM encoder, which is trained to learn a similarity mapping of the input embeddings to their corresponding documents. Finally, to enable the online fine-tuning of both (i) the encoder soft embeddings and (ii) the classifier-as-retriever on edge devices, we adopt federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) to achieve an efficient, privacy-preserving, and product-grade training solution. We conduct a theoretical analysis of our methodology, establishing convergence guarantees under mild assumptions on gradient variance when deployed for general smooth nonconvex loss functions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate (i) the efficacy of obtaining soft embeddings to enhance the encoder, (ii) training a classifier to improve the retriever, and (iii) the role of FL in achieving speedup.

<div> Approach, Weighted co-training, Large Language Models, Semi-supervised learning, Performance <br />
Summary:<br />
This paper presents a novel weighted co-training approach guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) for semi-supervised learning. The approach involves co-training two encoder-only networks using LLM labels as target labels on unlabeled data. The networks iteratively train each other, recording confidence estimates in the LLM label for each sample. Importance weights are then derived based on each network's confidence, and exchanged between the networks for back-propagation and parameter updates. By leveraging LLM-generated guidance, the approach surpasses traditional semi-supervised learning methods, particularly in scenarios with ample unlabeled data. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, ranking first among 14 compared methods. This highlights the potential of using LLMs as knowledge amplifiers to enhance backbone co-training models efficiently. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted co-training approach that is guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, in our co-training approach, we use LLM labels on unlabeled data as target labels and co-train two encoder-only based networks that train each other over multiple iterations: first, all samples are forwarded through each network and historical estimates of each network's confidence in the LLM label are recorded; second, a dynamic importance weight is derived for each sample according to each network's belief in the quality of the LLM label for that sample; finally, the two networks exchange importance weights with each other -- each network back-propagates all samples weighted with the importance weights coming from its peer network and updates its own parameters. By strategically utilizing LLM-generated guidance, our approach significantly outperforms conventional SSL methods, particularly in settings with abundant unlabeled data. Empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets and ranks first among 14 compared methods according to the Friedman test. Our results highlight a new direction in semi-supervised learning -- where LLMs serve as knowledge amplifiers, enabling backbone co-training models to achieve state-of-the-art performance efficiently.

Summary:
Process reward models (PRMs) provide detailed evaluations for large language models (LLMs) but are challenging to develop due to the high cost of human-annotated data. This study explores the noise distribution in synthetic data from Monte Carlo estimation, finding that annotation models can underestimate or overestimate correctness. A Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation (SCAN) framework is proposed to address this issue. The framework enables lightweight models to produce high-quality annotations and improves PRM performance with minimal inference cost. Through robust learning strategies, PRMs can effectively learn from weak supervision, achieving significant performance improvements in tasks like mathematical reasoning. SCAN shows potential for cost-efficient and robust PRM training, outperforming baselines trained on human-annotated datasets and demonstrating performance gains with the scaling of synthetic data. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that facilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving effective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a 39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines, including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable, cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.

Summary:
ViTCAE introduces a framework that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders by repurposing the global Class token for generative purposes. By mapping the Class token to a global latent variable that influences local latent variables, ViTCAE establishes a strong link between global semantics and local detail synthesis. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, ViTCAE employs an adaptive attention mechanism that treats attention heads as interacting tokens seeking consensus. This approach includes a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adjusts each head's influence based on distributional stability, leading to a principled head-freezing mechanism for improved computational efficiency. By unifying the generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global Class token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative control and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.

By combining an unrolled decoder with a jointly learnt unsourced random access codebook, the proposed method extends reliable operation by over 7 dB and improves global model convergence at all SNR levels.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables distributed model training across wireless devices without centralising raw data, but deployment is constrained by the wireless uplink. A promising direction is over-the-air (OTA) aggregation, which merges communication with computation. Existing digital OTA methods can achieve either strong convergence or robustness to noise, but struggle to achieve both simultaneously, limiting performance in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) where many IoT devices operate. This work proposes a learnt digital OTA framework that extends reliable operation into low-SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art. The proposed method combines an unrolled decoder with a jointly learnt unsourced random access codebook. Results show an extension of reliable operation by more than 7 dB, with improved global model convergence across all SNR levels, highlighting the potential of learning-based design for FEEL.

Summary:
This article addresses the sample complexity of learning in constrained average-reward Markov decision processes (CAMDPs) under a generative model. The study focuses on two settings: relaxed feasibility allowing small constraint violations and strict feasibility requiring the output policy to satisfy the constraint. The proposed model-based algorithm achieves sample complexities of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{\epsilon^2 \zeta^2} \right)$ under the relaxed and strict feasibility settings, respectively. The results establish a matching lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ for the strict feasibility case, providing minimax-optimal bounds for CAMDPs. The findings significantly contribute to closing the gap in understanding the complexity of constrained average-reward MDPs.

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the sample complexity of learning in average-reward Markov decision processes (AMDPs) under the generative model. However, much less is known about the constrained average-reward MDP (CAMDP), where policies must satisfy long-run average constraints. In this work, we address this gap by studying the sample complexity of learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in CAMDPs under a generative model. We propose a model-based algorithm that operates under two settings: (i) relaxed feasibility, which allows small constraint violations, and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy satisfies the constraint. We show that our algorithm achieves sample complexities of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$ and $\tilde{O} \left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{\epsilon^2 \zeta^2} \right)$ under the relaxed and strict feasibility settings, respectively. Here, $\zeta$ is the Slater constant indicating the size of the feasible region, $H$ is the span bound of the bias function, and $B$ is the transient time bound. Moreover, a matching lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ for the strict feasibility case is established, thus providing the first minimax-optimal bounds for CAMDPs. Our results close the theoretical gap in understanding the complexity of constrained average-reward MDPs.

Summary:
GraphIDS is a novel self-supervised intrusion detection model that integrates representation learning and anomaly detection for network traffic. By utilizing graph neural networks and a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, the model learns local graph representations of normal communication patterns without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with high reconstruction errors are identified as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework optimizes embeddings for the downstream task, improving the recognition of malicious traffic. On various NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS outperforms existing baselines, achieving high PR-AUC and macro F1-score. Its unified approach offers a more effective solution for detecting network intrusions in scenarios with limited supervision and evolving attack patterns. <div>
arXiv:2509.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.

<div> Keywords: Positional encoding, Transformer, Causal structure, Directed acyclic graph, Hyperbolic space

Summary: 
- The proposed method CAPE identifies causal structure over non-sequential features using a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a hyperboloid model-based approach.

Abstract: Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel approach, $\lambda$-orthogonality regularization, to adapt learned representations in neural networks. By combining affine transformations with relaxed orthogonality constraints, the method aims to align latent spaces of updated models with previous models while preserving original representations. Extensive experiments across various datasets and architectures validate the effectiveness of the approach. The method not only ensures distribution-specific adaptation but also retains zero-shot performance and compatibility across model updates. The code for implementing this approach is available on GitHub, providing a practical tool for researchers working on adapting neural network representations. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval systems rely on representations learned by increasingly powerful models. However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality constraint, namely $\lambda$-orthogonality regularization, while learning an affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across model updates.

arXiv:2509.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as a promising feedback control strategy for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in state and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been proposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In particular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents cooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on local state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may become a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents is crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in PDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a decentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional, parametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to effectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect to the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by sinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control problems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can effectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents, outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal with parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and (iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of ~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on computationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating the dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.

<div> Keywords: power outages, forecasting, LSTM networks, deep learning, PCA

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel hybrid deep learning framework, PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM, for accurately forecasting power outages. By integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM network, the framework effectively addresses the challenges posed by factors such as weather conditions and load fluctuations. PCA reduces dimensionality and stabilizes data variance, while PR models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM component enhances temporal feature learning and captures long-term dependencies efficiently. Evaluation on real-world outage records from Michigan demonstrates the framework's significant improvement in forecasting accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods. The proposed approach showcases the potential of deep learning models, specifically LSTM networks, in addressing the complexities of power outage prediction.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting power outages is a complex task influenced by diverse factors such as weather conditions [1], vegetation, wildlife, and load fluctuations. These factors introduce substantial variability and noise into outage data, making reliable prediction challenging. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly effective for modeling nonlinear and dynamic time-series data, with proven applications in stock price forecasting [2], energy demand prediction, demand response [3], and traffic flow management [4]. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning framework, termed PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM, that integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM. PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality and stabilize data variance, while Poisson Regression effectively models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM component enhances temporal feature learning through efficient gradient optimization and long-term dependency capture. The framework is evaluated using real-world outage records from Michigan, and results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves forecasting accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Why should a clinician trust an Artificial Intelligence (AI) prediction? Despite the increasing accuracy of machine learning methods in medicine, the lack of transparency continues to hinder their adoption in clinical practice. In this work, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for clinical classification tasks on tabular data. Unlike traditional neural networks, KANs are function-based architectures that offer intrinsic interpretability through transparent, symbolic representations. We introduce Logistic-KAN, a flexible generalization of logistic regression, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Additive Model (KAAM), a simplified additive variant that delivers transparent, symbolic formulas. Unlike black-box models that require post-hoc explainability tools, our models support built-in patient-level insights, intuitive visualizations, and nearest-patient retrieval. Across multiple health datasets, our models match or outperform standard baselines, while remaining fully interpretable. These results position KANs as a promising step toward trustworthy AI that clinicians can understand, audit, and act upon.

Summary:
This article introduces a new analytical approach for discrete diffusion models, focusing on the efficiency of discretized samplers like $\tau$-leaping. The traditional $\tau$-leaping method is analyzed, with convergence guarantees in KL divergence established to scale linearly with the vocabulary size, improving upon previous results with quadratic dependence. The approach extends to other samplers such as the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping, providing the first convergence guarantees for these methods. A novel technique based on differential inequalities is central to this analysis, offering a more flexible alternative to traditional change-of-measure methods like Girsanov. This technique not only enhances the study of discrete diffusion models but also holds potential for analyzing other stochastic processes. <div>
arXiv:2509.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers. Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to their empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of $\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of other stochastic processes.

<div> mixture classifier, multimodal categories, geometric structure, interpretability, efficiency

Summary:
The Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC) addresses the challenge of classifying multimodal categories by representing each class as a mixture of hyperplanes. This approach allows for better performance than classical linear models while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency. By combining plane scores using a soft-OR function within each class and using softmax for probabilistic posteriors across classes, GMC achieves competitive results on synthetic datasets and tabular/image benchmarks. The use of Random Fourier Features (RFF) enables nonlinear mappings while keeping inference linear in the number of planes and features. Practical training techniques such as geometry-aware initialization and alpha annealing make GMC easy to implement. With post-hoc temperature scaling, GMC reduces expected calibration error (ECE) and provides geometric introspection through visualizations of per-plane and class responsibilities. This balance of accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency positions GMC as a valuable tool for classification tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real world categories are multimodal, with single classes occupying disjoint regions in feature space. Classical linear models (logistic regression, linear SVM) use a single global hyperplane and perform poorly on such data, while high-capacity methods (kernel SVMs, deep nets) fit multimodal structure but at the expense of interpretability, heavier tuning, and higher computational cost. We propose the Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC), a discriminative model that represents each class as a mixture of hyperplanes. Within each class, GMC combines plane scores via a temperature-controlled soft-OR (log-sum-exp), smoothly approximating the max; across classes, standard softmax yields probabilistic posteriors. GMC optionally uses Random Fourier Features (RFF) for nonlinear mappings while keeping inference linear in the number of planes and features. Our practical training recipe: geometry-aware k-means initialization, silhouette-based plane budgeting, alpha annealing, usage-aware L2 regularization, label smoothing, and early stopping, makes GMC plug-and-play. Across synthetic multimodal datasets (moons, circles, blobs, spirals) and tabular/image benchmarks (iris, wine, WDBC, digits), GMC consistently outperforms linear baselines and k-NN, is competitive with RBF-SVM, Random Forests, and small MLPs, and provides geometric introspection via per-plane and class responsibility visualizations. Inference scales linearly in planes and features, making GMC CPU-friendly, with single-digit microsecond latency per example, often faster than RBF-SVM and compact MLPs. Post-hoc temperature scaling reduces ECE from about 0.06 to 0.02. GMC thus strikes a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency: it is more expressive than linear models and lighter, more transparent, and faster than kernel or deep models.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a new method called DISentangled COmmunication (DISCO) Steering for guiding large language model outputs using steering vectors injected directly into query and value representation spaces within attention heads. The approach aims to enhance linear discriminability of concepts within these spaces compared to traditional steering methods. Analysis shows that DISCO disentangles a baseline by modulating attention inputs, resulting in more granular control over queries and values. Experimental results demonstrate DISCO's superior performance on various datasets, achieving up to 19.1% higher steering efficacy than other techniques. The findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging query and value spaces as key components in steering vector methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of recent methods guide large language model outputs via the inference-time addition of steering vectors to residual-stream or attention-head representations. In contrast, we propose to inject steering vectors directly into the query and value representation spaces within attention heads. We provide evidence that a greater portion of these spaces exhibit high linear discriminability of concepts --a key property motivating the use of steering vectors-- than attention head outputs. We analytically characterize the effect of our method, which we term DISentangled COmmunication (DISCO) Steering, on attention head outputs. Our analysis reveals that DISCO disentangles a strong but underutilized baseline, steering attention inputs, which implicitly modifies queries and values in a rigid manner. In contrast, DISCO's direct modulation of these components enables more granular control. We find that DISCO achieves superior performance over a number of steering vector baselines across multiple datasets on LLaMA 3.1 8B and Gemma 2 9B, with steering efficacy scoring up to 19.1% higher than the runner-up. Our results support the conclusion that the query and value spaces are powerful building blocks for steering vector methods.

Summary:
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO) is introduced as a dual-domain neural operator combining spectral and spatial bases for enhanced interpretability. Theoretical analysis shows KANO's superiority over Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) in handling position-dependent dynamics without the constraint of fast-decaying input Fourier tail. Empirical validation on position-dependent differential operators demonstrates KANO's robust generalization compared to FNO. In quantum Hamiltonian learning, KANO accurately reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians with symbolic representations and achieves low state infidelity from projective measurement data, outperforming FNO by orders of magnitude trained with full wave function data. This highlights KANO's effectiveness in capturing complex physical dynamics and symbolic representation of operators, making it a valuable tool for various applications. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.

Summary: 
SOLAR introduces a Switchable Output Layer (SOL) to improve Once-for-All (OFA) training by assigning separate classification heads to each sub-net while sharing the backbone. This reduces interference and enhances optimization without retraining the backbone. Evaluations on five datasets and four different backbones show that SOLAR outperforms baseline methods. It improves sub-net accuracy by up to 4.71% and sub-net robustness by up to 9.01% on various datasets compared to the OATS framework. When compared to SNNs, it enhances TinyImageNet accuracy by up to 2.93% using different backbones. SOLAR provides flexibility in trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and model-size without sacrificing overall performance, making it a valuable technique for efficient neural network training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Once-for-All (OFA) training enables a single super-net to generate multiple sub-nets tailored to diverse deployment scenarios, supporting flexible trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and model-size without retraining. However, as the number of supported sub-nets increases, excessive parameter sharing in the backbone limits representational capacity, leading to degraded calibration and reduced overall performance. To address this, we propose SOLAR (Switchable Output Layer for Accuracy and Robustness in Once-for-All Training), a simple yet effective technique that assigns each sub-net a separate classification head. By decoupling the logit learning process across sub-nets, the Switchable Output Layer (SOL) reduces representational interference and improves optimization, without altering the shared backbone. We evaluate SOLAR on five datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet) using four super-net backbones (ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, WideResNet-40-2, and MobileNetV2) for two OFA training frameworks (OATS and SNNs). Experiments show that SOLAR outperforms the baseline methods: compared to OATS, it improves accuracy of sub-nets up to 1.26 %, 4.71 %, 1.67 %, and 1.76 %, and robustness up to 9.01 %, 7.71 %, 2.72 %, and 1.26 % on SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and CIFAR-100, respectively. Compared to SNNs, it improves TinyImageNet accuracy by up to 2.93 %, 2.34 %, and 1.35 % using ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, and MobileNetV2 backbones (with 8 sub-nets), respectively.

Accurate assessment of intraventricular blood flow is crucial for evaluating hemodynamic conditions in LVAD-supported patients.

Additionally, the study explores the impact of conditioning the model on anatomical and physiological priors, highlighting the importance of incorporating prior knowledge for accurate velocity field reconstruction. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate assessment of intraventricular blood flow is essential for evaluating hemodynamic conditions in patients supported by Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs). However, clinical imaging is either incompatible with LVADs or yields sparse, low-quality velocity data. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide high-fidelity data, they are computationally intensive and impractical for routine clinical use. To address this, we propose LVADNet3D, a 3D convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs full-resolution intraventricular velocity fields from sparse velocity vector inputs. In contrast to a standard UNet3D model, LVADNet3D incorporates hybrid downsampling and a deeper encoder-decoder architecture with increased channel capacity to better capture spatial flow patterns. To train and evaluate the models, we generate a high-resolution synthetic dataset of intraventricular blood flow in LVAD-supported hearts using CFD simulations. We also investigate the effect of conditioning the models on anatomical and physiological priors. Across various input configurations, LVADNet3D outperforms the baseline UNet3D model, yielding lower reconstruction error and higher PSNR results.

Summary:
The article introduces a new attention mechanism called Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) that addresses the issues of efficiency and interpretability in Transformers. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, CBSA compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This mechanism scales linearly and can generalize existing attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that CBSA achieves comparable performance and offers superior advantages on various visual tasks. The proposed approach provides a unified optimization objective to improve the efficiency of attention mechanisms while maintaining interpretability. The code for CBSA is available for further exploration and application. <div>
arXiv:2509.16875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available at this https URL.

Summary: <br />
- DES-MoE is a framework for adapting Mixture-of-Experts models to multiple domains without catastrophic forgetting.

arXiv:2509.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer immense capacity via sparsely gated expert subnetworks, yet adapting them to multiple domains without catastrophic forgetting remains an open challenge. Existing approaches either incur prohibitive computation, suffer cross-domain interference, or require separate runs per domain. We propose DES-MoE, a dynamic expert specialization framework for multi-domain adaptation of Mixture-of-Experts models. DES-MoE addresses catastrophic forgetting through three innovations: (1) an adaptive router balancing pre-trained knowledge retention and task-specific updates via distillation, (2) real-time expert-domain correlation mapping to isolate domain-specific gradients, and (3) a three-phase adaptive fine-tuning schedule that progressively freezes non-specialized parameters. Evaluated on six domains (math, code, law, etc.), DES-MoE matches single-domain ESFT performance while training one unified model, reduces forgetting by 89% compared to full fine-tuning as domains scale from 2 to 6, and achieves 68% faster convergence than conventional methods. Our work establishes dynamic expert isolation as a scalable paradigm for multi-task MoE adaptation.

<div> Keywords: fake news detection, social media, dynamic representation, ensemble selection, instance hardness measures

Summary:
The paper introduces a new method called Dynamic Representation and Ensemble Selection (DRES) for detecting fake news using text-based information on social media platforms. DRES utilizes instance hardness measures to evaluate the level of difficulty in classifying each news article based on various textual feature representations.

Abstract: The rapid spread of information via social media has made text-based fake news detection critically important due to its societal impact. This paper presents a novel detection method called Dynamic Representation and Ensemble Selection (DRES) for identifying fake news based solely on text. DRES leverages instance hardness measures to estimate the classification difficulty for each news article across multiple textual feature representations. By dynamically selecting the textual representation and the most competent ensemble of classifiers for each instance, DRES significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRES achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of representation selection based on instance hardness and dynamic ensemble selection in boosting performance.

Summary:
The article discusses the complexity of finding local optima in contrastive learning problems. It focuses on the discovery of meaningful data representations through contrastive information, which involves weighted triplets indicating similarities between anchor, positive, and negative examples. The study proves the Polynomial Local Search (PLS)-hardness in discrete settings and Continuous Local Search (CLS)-hardness in continuous settings for various contrastive learning problems. This suggests that no polynomial time algorithm can find a local optimum unless certain complexity classes are contained within P. Even if such containment occurs, the study shows that local search algorithms may still require exponential time to reach a local optimum in some instances, even for one-dimensional embeddings. <div>

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a powerful technique for discovering meaningful data representations by optimizing objectives based on $\textit{contrastive information}$, often given as a set of weighted triplets $\{(x_i, y_i^+, z_{i}^-)\}_{i = 1}^m$ indicating that an "anchor" $x_i$ is more similar to a "positive" example $y_i$ than to a "negative" example $z_i$. The goal is to find representations (e.g., embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or a tree metric) where anchors are placed closer to positive than to negative examples. While finding $\textit{global}$ optima of contrastive objectives is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard, the complexity of finding $\textit{local}$ optima -- representations that do not improve by local search algorithms such as gradient-based methods -- remains open. Our work settles the complexity of finding local optima in various contrastive learning problems by proving $\mathsf{PLS}$-hardness in discrete settings (e.g., maximize satisfied triplets) and $\mathsf{CLS}$-hardness in continuous settings (e.g., minimize Triplet Loss), where $\mathsf{PLS}$ (Polynomial Local Search) and $\mathsf{CLS}$ (Continuous Local Search) are well-studied complexity classes capturing local search dynamics in discrete and continuous optimization, respectively. Our results imply that no polynomial time algorithm (local search or otherwise) can find a local optimum for various contrastive learning problems, unless $\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$ for continuous problems). Even in the unlikely scenario that $\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$), our reductions imply that there exist instances where local search algorithms need exponential time to reach a local optimum, even for $d=1$ (embeddings on a line).

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables distributed devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while maintaining data privacy. However, the heterogeneous hardware capabilities of devices often result in significant training delays, as straggler clients with limited resources prolong the aggregation process. Existing solutions such as client selection, asynchronous FL, and partial training partially address these challenges but encounter issues such as reduced accuracy, stale updates, and compromised model performance due to inconsistent training contributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedEL, a federated elastic learning framework that enhances training efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. FedEL introduces a novel window-based training process, sliding the window to locate the training part of the model and dynamically selecting important tensors for training within a coordinated runtime budget. This approach ensures progressive and balanced training across all clients, including stragglers. Additionally, FedEL employs a tensor importance adjustment module, harmonizing local and global tensor importance to mitigate biases caused by data heterogeneity. The experiment results show that FedEL achieves up to 3.87x improvement in time-to-accuracy compared to baselines while maintaining or exceeding final test accuracy.

Summary:
- The article discusses the importance of measuring the multicalibration of predictors, focusing on two key properties: capturing the modifications needed for perfect multicalibration and being auditable in an information-theoretic sense.
- Two natural generalizations of the distance to calibration framework were considered for multiple subgroups: worst group dCE (wdMC) and distance to multicalibration (dMC).
- It was found that wdMC and dMC do not fully meet the requirements, highlighting the challenges in auditing multicalibration and fairness notions.
- Two equivalent multicalibration metrics that satisfy the aforementioned properties were proposed: a continuized variant of dMC and a distance to intersection multicalibration based on intersectional fairness desiderata.
- The study also delves into the loss landscape of distance to multicalibration and the geometry of perfectly multicalibrated predictors, with implications for developing stronger multicalibration algorithms and multigroup auditing practices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration is a critical property for establishing the trustworthiness of predictors that provide uncertainty estimates. Multicalibration is a strengthening of calibration which requires that predictors be calibrated on a potentially overlapping collection of subsets of the domain. As multicalibration grows in popularity with practitioners, an essential question is: how do we measure how multicalibrated a predictor is? B{\l}asiok et al. (2023) considered this question for standard calibration by introducing the distance to calibration framework (dCE) to understand how calibration metrics relate to each other and the ground truth. Building on the dCE framework, we consider the auditability of the distance to multicalibration of a predictor $f$.
  We begin by considering two natural generalizations of dCE to multiple subgroups: worst group dCE (wdMC), and distance to multicalibration (dMC). We argue that there are two essential properties of any multicalibration error metric: 1) the metric should capture how much $f$ would need to be modified in order to be perfectly multicalibrated; and 2) the metric should be auditable in an information theoretic sense. We show that wdMC and dMC each fail to satisfy one of these two properties, and that similar barriers arise when considering the auditability of general distance to multigroup fairness notions. We then propose two (equivalent) multicalibration metrics which do satisfy these requirements: 1) a continuized variant of dMC; and 2) a distance to intersection multicalibration, which leans on intersectional fairness desiderata. Along the way, we shed light on the loss-landscape of distance to multicalibration and the geometry of the set of perfectly multicalibrated predictors. Our findings may have implications for the development of stronger multicalibration algorithms as well as multigroup auditing more generally.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the detection of potentially dangerous tendencies of social media users in an innovative multimodal way. We integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) together. Firstly, we apply NLP on the user-generated text and conduct semantic analysis, sentiment recognition and keyword extraction to get subtle risk signals from social media posts. Meanwhile, we build a heterogeneous user relationship graph based on social interaction and propose a novel relational graph convolutional network to model user relationship, attention relationship and content dissemination path to discover some important structural information and user behaviors. Finally, we combine textual features extracted from these two models above with graph structural information, which provides a more robust and effective way to discover at-risk users. Our experiments on real social media datasets from different platforms show that our model can achieve significant improvement over single-modality methods.

<div> scheduler, gradient interference, multi-task learning, interference graph, graph-coloring

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach to multi-task learning optimization by addressing the issue of gradient interference when conflicting objectives slow convergence. A scheduler is used to compute gradient interference and construct an interference graph, which is then partitioned using greedy graph-coloring to group tasks that align well together. Only one group of tasks is activated at each training step, ensuring that tasks within the same group update in compatible directions. This dynamic grouping partition adapts to changing task relationships during training. Empirical results on various datasets demonstrate that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms both baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. <div>

Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated. The grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, model performance will be improved rather than impeded. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers.

<title>PTQTP: Post-Training Quantization to Trit-Planes for Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2509.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) to extremely low bit-widths remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. While existing ultra-low-bit PTQ methods rely on binary approximations or complex compensation mechanisms, they suffer from either limited representational capacity or computational overhead that undermines their efficiency gains. We introduce PTQ to Trit-Planes (PTQTP), the first ternary-weight PTQ framework that decomposes weight matrices into structured ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes using 2x1.58-bit representation. PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to 1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel structured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2) model-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for mixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP significantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4% mathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP approaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU days for training-based methods. These results establish PTQTP as a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce persistence spheres, a novel functional representation of persistence diagrams. Unlike existing embeddings (such as persistence images, landscapes, or kernel methods), persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous mapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a theoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making persistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the Wasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. We derive explicit formulas for persistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and parallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse regression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series, graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres consistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to persistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from computational inefficiency due to overthinking, where a fixed reasoning budget fails to match the varying complexity of tasks. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Overclocking, a method that makes the overclocking hyperparameter $\alpha$ dynamic and context-aware. Our method adjusts reasoning speed in real time through two complementary signals: (1) token-level model uncertainty for fine-grained step-wise control, and (2) input complexity estimation for informed initialization. We implement this approach with three strategies: Uncertainty-Aware Alpha Scheduling (UA-$\alpha$S), Complexity-Guided Alpha Initialization (CG-$\alpha$I), and a Hybrid Adaptive Control (HAC) that combines both. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and SVAMP show that HAC achieves superior accuracy-latency trade-offs, reducing unnecessary computation on simple problems while allocating more resources to challenging ones. By mitigating overthinking, Adaptive Overclocking enhances both efficiency and overall reasoning performance.

<title>Long-Tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection with Refined Separate Class Learning</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine learning models. However, when training data follows a long-tailed distribution, the model's ability to accurately detect OOD samples is significantly compromised, due to the confusion between OOD samples and head/tail classes. To distinguish OOD samples from both head and tail classes, the separate class learning (SCL) approach has emerged as a promising solution, which separately conduct head-specific and tail-specific class learning. To this end, we examine the limitations of existing works of SCL and reveal that the OOD detection performance is notably influenced by the use of static scaling temperature value and the presence of uninformative outliers. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel approach termed Refined Separate Class Learning (RSCL), which leverages dynamic class-wise temperature adjustment to modulate the temperature parameter for each in-distribution class and informative outlier mining to identify diverse types of outliers based on their affinity with head and tail classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCL achieves superior OOD detection performance while improving the classification accuracy on in-distribution data.

Abstract: Bayesian hyperparameter optimization relies heavily on Gaussian Process (GP) surrogates, due to robust distributional posteriors and strong performance on limited training samples. GPs however underperform in categorical hyperparameter environments or when assumptions of normality, heteroskedasticity and symmetry are excessively challenged. Conformalized quantile regression can address these estimation weaknesses, while still providing robust calibration guarantees. This study builds upon early work in this area by addressing feedback covariate shift in sequential acquisition and integrating a wider range of surrogate architectures and acquisition functions. Proposed algorithms are rigorously benchmarked against a range of state of the art hyperparameter optimization methods (GP, TPE and SMAC). Findings identify quantile surrogate architectures and acquisition functions yielding superior performance to the current quantile literature, while validating the beneficial impact of conformalization on calibration and search performance.

Abstract: Recently, deep learning has driven significant advancements in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) tasks. However, much of the current research in MTSF tends to evaluate models from a holistic perspective, which obscures the individual contributions and leaves critical issues unaddressed. Adhering to the current modeling paradigms, this work bridges these gaps by systematically decomposing deep MTSF methods into their core, fine-grained components like series-patching tokenization, channel-independent strategy, attention modules, or even Large Language Models and Time-series Foundation Models. Through extensive experiments and component-level analysis, our work offers more profound insights than previous benchmarks that typically discuss models as a whole.
  Furthermore, we propose a novel automated solution called TSGym for MTSF tasks. Unlike traditional hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture searching or fixed model selection, TSGym performs fine-grained component selection and automated model construction, which enables the creation of more effective solutions tailored to diverse time series data, therefore enhancing model transferability across different data sources and robustness against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments indicate that TSGym significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art MTSF and AutoML methods. All code is publicly available on https://github.com/SUFE-AILAB/TSGym.

<title>On the Limits of Tabular Hardness Metrics for Deep RL: A Study with the Pharos Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Principled evaluation is critical for progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet it lags behind the theory-driven benchmarks of tabular RL. While tabular settings benefit from well-understood hardness measures like MDP diameter and suboptimality gaps, deep RL benchmarks are often chosen based on intuition and popularity. This raises a critical question: can tabular hardness metrics be adapted to guide non-tabular benchmarking? We investigate this question and reveal a fundamental gap. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that the difficulty of non-tabular environments is dominated by a factor that tabular metrics ignore: representation hardness. The same underlying MDP can pose vastly different challenges depending on whether the agent receives state vectors or pixel-based observations. To enable this analysis, we introduce \texttt{pharos}, a new open-source library for principled RL benchmarking that allows for systematic control over both environment structure and agent representations. Our extensive case study using \texttt{pharos} shows that while tabular metrics offer some insight, they are poor predictors of deep RL agent performance on their own. This work highlights the urgent need for new, representation-aware hardness measures and positions \texttt{pharos} as a key tool for developing them.

Abstract: The integration of solar power has been increasing as the green energy transition rolls out. The penetration of solar power challenges the grid stability and energy scheduling, due to its intermittent energy generation. Accurate and near real-time solar power prediction is of critical importance to tolerant and support the permeation of distributed and volatile solar power production in the energy system. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning based ultra-short-term solar power prediction with data reconstruction. We decompose the data for the prediction to facilitate extensive exploration of the spatial and temporal dependencies within the data. Particularly, we reconstruct the data into low- and high-frequency components, using ensemble empirical model decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). We integrate meteorological data with those two components, and employ deep-learning models to capture long- and short-term dependencies towards the target prediction period. In this way, we excessively exploit the features in historical data in predicting a ultra-short-term solar power production. Furthermore, as ultra-short-term prediction is vulnerable to local optima, we modify the optimization in our deep-learning training by penalizing long prediction intervals. Numerical experiments with diverse settings demonstrate that, compared to baseline models, the proposed method achieves improved generalization in data reconstruction and higher prediction accuracy for ultra-short-term solar power production.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) plays a critical role in improving model performance. Transformer-based HPO methods have shown great potential; however, existing approaches rely heavily on large-scale historical optimization trajectories and lack effective reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, thereby limiting their efficiency and performance improvements. Inspired by the success of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in large language models (LLMs), we propose GRPOformer -- a novel hyperparameter optimization framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with Transformers. In GRPOformer, Transformers are employed to generate new hyperparameter configurations from historical optimization trajectories, while GRPO enables rapid trajectory construction and optimization strategy learning from scratch. Moreover, we introduce Policy Churn Regularization (PCR) to enhance the stability of GRPO training. Experimental results on OpenML demonstrate that GRPOformer consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse tasks, offering new insights into the application of RL for HPO.

Abstract: To address the intermittency of renewable energy source (RES) generation, scenario forecasting offers a series of stochastic realizations for predictive objects with superior flexibility and direct views. Based on a long time-series perspective, this paper explores uncertainties in the realms of renewable power and deep learning. Then, an uncertainty-aware model is meticulously designed for renewable scenario forecasting, which leverages an attention mechanism and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to precisely capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics. To improve the interpretability of uncertain behavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and variations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information, forecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the synergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities. Numerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty representation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to forecast the future behavior of ongoing process instances using historical event data, enabling proactive decision-making. While recent advances rely heavily on deep learning models such as LSTMs and Transformers, their high computational cost hinders practical adoption. Prior work has explored data reduction techniques and alternative feature encodings, but the effect of simplifying model architectures themselves remains underexplored. In this paper, we analyze how reducing model complexity, both in terms of parameter count and architectural depth, impacts predictive performance, using two established PPM approaches. Across five diverse event logs, we show that shrinking the Transformer model by 85% results in only a 2-3% drop in performance across various PPM tasks, while the LSTM proves slightly more sensitive, particularly for waiting time prediction. Overall, our findings suggest that substantial model simplification can preserve predictive accuracy, paving the way for more efficient and scalable PPM solutions.

Abstract: We present Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes (FiD-GP), a compression framework that incorporates a compact inducing weight matrix to project a neural network's weight uncertainty into a lower-dimensional subspace. Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression, image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude, compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we unroll the dynamics of the dual ascent (DA) algorithm in two coupled graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve constrained optimization problems. The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.

Abstract: Time series data is a prevalent form of data found in various fields. It consists of a series of measurements taken over time. Forecasting is a crucial application of time series models, where future values are predicted based on historical data. Accurate forecasting is essential for making well-informed decisions across industries. When it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), precise predictions play a key role in planning infrastructure development, load balancing, and energy management. This study introduces a BI-LSTM embedding denoising autoencoder model (BDM) designed to address time series problems, focusing on short-term EV charging load prediction. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with benchmark models like Transformer, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Based on the results of the study, the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in four of the five-time steps, demonstrating its effectiveness for time series forecasting. This research makes a significant contribution to enhancing time series forecasting, thereby improving decision-making processes.

<title>Detecting Urban PM$_{2.5}$ Hotspots with Mobile Sensing and Gaussian Process Regression</title>

Abstract: Low-cost mobile sensors can be used to collect PM$_{2.5}$ concentration data throughout an entire city. However, identifying air pollution hotspots from the data is challenging due to the uneven spatial sampling, temporal variations in the background air quality, and the dynamism of urban air pollution sources. This study proposes a method to identify urban PM$_{2.5}$ hotspots that addresses these challenges, involving four steps: (1) equip citizen scientists with mobile PM$_{2.5}$ sensors while they travel; (2) normalise the raw data to remove the influence of background ambient pollution levels; (3) fit a Gaussian process regression model to the normalised data and (4) calculate a grid of spatially explicit 'hotspot scores' using the probabilistic framework of Gaussian processes, which conveniently summarise the relative pollution levels throughout the city. We apply our method to create the first ever map of PM$_{2.5}$ pollution in Kigali, Rwanda, at a 200m resolution. Our results suggest that the level of ambient PM$_{2.5}$ pollution in Kigali is dangerously high, and we identify the hotspots in Kigali where pollution consistently exceeds the city-wide average. We also evaluate our method using simulated mobile sensing data for Beijing, China, where we find that the hotspot scores are probabilistically well calibrated and accurately reflect the 'ground truth' spatial profile of PM$_{2.5}$ pollution. Thanks to the use of open-source software, our method can be re-applied in cities throughout the world with a handful of low-cost sensors. The method can help fill the gap in urban air quality information and empower public health officials.

Abstract: In the era of the digitally driven economy, where there has been an exponential surge in digital payment systems and other online activities, various forms of fraudulent activities have accompanied the digital growth, out of which credit card fraud has become an increasingly significant threat. To deal with this, real-time fraud detection is essential for financial security but remains challenging due to high transaction volumes and the complexity of modern fraud patterns. This study presents a comprehensive performance comparison between traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and ensemble methods like Stacking and Voting Classifier for detecting credit card fraud on a heavily imbalanced public dataset, where the number of fraudulent transactions is 492 out of 284,807 total transactions. Application-specific preprocessing techniques were applied, and the models were evaluated using various performance metrics. The ensemble methods achieved an almost perfect precision of around 0.99, but traditional methods demonstrated superior performance in terms of recall, which highlights the trade-off between false positives and false negatives. The comprehensive comparison reveals distinct performance strengths and limitations for each algorithm, offering insights to guide practitioners in selecting the most effective model for robust fraud detection applications in real-world settings.

<title>Regularizing Extrapolation in Causal Inference</title>

Abstract: Many common estimators in machine learning and causal inference are linear smoothers, where the prediction is a weighted average of the training outcomes. Some estimators, such as ordinary least squares and kernel ridge regression, allow for arbitrarily negative weights, which improve feature imbalance but often at the cost of increased dependence on parametric modeling assumptions and higher variance. By contrast, estimators like importance weighting and random forests (sometimes implicitly) restrict weights to be non-negative, reducing dependence on parametric modeling and variance at the cost of worse imbalance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that directly penalizes the level of extrapolation, replacing the current practice of a hard non-negativity constraint with a soft constraint and corresponding hyperparameter. We derive a worst-case extrapolation error bound and introduce a novel "bias-bias-variance" tradeoff, encompassing biases due to feature imbalance, model misspecification, and estimator variance; this tradeoff is especially pronounced in high dimensions, particularly when positivity is poor. We then develop an optimization procedure that regularizes this bound while minimizing imbalance and outline how to use this approach as a sensitivity analysis for dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through synthetic experiments and a real-world application, involving the generalization of randomized controlled trial estimates to a target population of interest.

Abstract: The aerodynamic optimization of cars requires close collaboration between aerodynamicists and stylists, while slow, expensive simulations remain a bottleneck. Surrogate models have been shown to accurately predict aerodynamics within the design space for which they were trained. However, many of these models struggle to scale to higher resolutions because of the 3D nature of the problem and data scarcity. We propose Progressive Multi-Resolution Training (PMRT), a probabilistic multi-resolution training schedule that enables training a U-Net to predict the drag coefficient ($c_d$) and high-resolution velocity fields (512 x 128 x 128) in 24 hours on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, 7x cheaper than the high-resolution-only baseline, with similar accuracy. PMRT samples batches from three resolutions based on probabilities that change during training, starting with an emphasis on lower resolutions and gradually shifting toward higher resolutions. Since this is a training methodology, it can be adapted to other high-resolution-focused backbones. We also show that a single model can be trained across five datasets from different solvers, including a real-world dataset, by conditioning on the simulation parameters. In the DrivAerML dataset, our models achieve a $c_d$ $R^2$ of 0.975, matching literature baselines at a fraction of the training cost.

Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons, thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling on edge platforms.

<title>SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing</title>

arXiv:2509.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

<title>Conditional Policy Generator for Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization</title>

Abstract: Leveraging machine learning methods to solve constraint satisfaction problems has shown promising, but they are mostly limited to a static situation where the problem description is completely known and fixed from the beginning. In this work we present a new approach to constraint satisfaction and optimization in dynamically changing environments, particularly when variables in the problem are statistically independent. We frame it as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce a conditional policy generator by borrowing the idea of class conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). Assuming that the problem includes both static and dynamic constraints, the former are used in a reward formulation to guide the policy training such that it learns to map to a probabilistic distribution of solutions satisfying static constraints from a noise prior, which is similar to a generator in GANs. On the other hand, dynamic constraints in the problem are encoded to different class labels and fed with the input noise. The policy is then simultaneously updated for maximum likelihood of correctly classifying given the dynamic conditions in a supervised manner. We empirically demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment with a multi-modal constraint satisfaction problem and compare between unconditional and conditional cases.

Abstract: Machine learned coarse grained (CG) potentials are fast, but degrade over time when simulations reach undersampled biomolecular conformations, and generating widespread all atom (AA) data to combat this is computationally infeasible. We propose a novel active learning framework for CG neural network potentials in molecular dynamics (MD). Building on the CGSchNet model, our method employs root mean squared deviation (RMSD) based frame selection from MD simulations in order to generate data on the fly by querying an oracle during the training of a neural network potential. This framework preserves CG level efficiency while correcting the model at precise, RMSD identified coverage gaps. By training CGSchNet, a coarse grained neural network potential, we empirically show that our framework explores previously unseen configurations and trains the model on unexplored regions of conformational space. Our active learning framework enables a CGSchNet model trained on the Chignolin protein to achieve a 33.05% improvement in the Wasserstein 1 (W1) metric in Time lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) space on an in house benchmark suite.

<title>Causal Representation Learning from Multimodal Clinical Records under Non-Random Modality Missingness</title>

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich patient information, such as diagnoses or medications, making them valuable for patient representation learning. Recent advances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract meaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are often missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of patients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations can be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or radiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by clinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality missing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation learning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in multimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion component that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning on missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven assignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning to ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask outcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from specific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across MIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving up to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU admission.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.

Abstract: This work introduces TraceHiding, a scalable, importance-aware machine unlearning framework for mobility trajectory data. Motivated by privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA granting users "the right to be forgotten," TraceHiding removes specified user trajectories from trained deep models without full retraining. It combines a hierarchical data-driven importance scoring scheme with teacher-student distillation. Importance scores--computed at token, trajectory, and user levels from statistical properties (coverage diversity, entropy, length)--quantify each training sample's impact, enabling targeted forgetting of high-impact data while preserving common patterns. The student model retains knowledge on remaining data and unlearns targeted trajectories through an importance-weighted loss that amplifies forgetting signals for unique samples and attenuates them for frequent ones. We validate on Trajectory--User Linking (TUL) tasks across three real-world higher-order mobility datasets (HO-Rome, HO-Geolife, HO-NYC) and multiple architectures (GRU, LSTM, BERT, ModernBERT, GCN-TULHOR), against strong unlearning baselines including SCRUB, NegGrad, NegGrad+, Bad-T, and Finetuning. Experiments under uniform and targeted user deletion show TraceHiding, especially its entropy-based variant, achieves superior unlearning accuracy, competitive membership inference attack (MIA) resilience, and up to 40\times speedup over retraining with minimal test accuracy loss. Results highlight robustness to adversarial deletion of high-information users and consistent performance across models. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of machine unlearning for trajectory data, providing a reproducible pipeline with public code and preprocessing tools.

Abstract: We introduce U-shaped encoder-decoder graph neural networks (U-GNNs) for stochastic graph signal generation using denoising diffusion processes. The architecture learns node features at different resolutions with skip connections between the encoder and decoder paths, analogous to the convolutional U-Net for image generation. The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening, with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the original graph. Applied to stock price prediction -- where deterministic forecasts struggle to capture uncertainties and tail events that are paramount -- we demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in probabilistic forecasting of stock prices.

Abstract: High-quality reference standard image data creation by neuroradiology experts for automated clinical tools can be a powerful tool for neuroradiology & artificial intelligence education. We developed a multimodal educational approach for students and trainees during the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Lighthouse Challenge 2025, a landmark initiative to develop accurate brain tumor segmentation algorithms. Fifty-six medical students & radiology trainees volunteered to annotate brain tumor MR images for the BraTS challenges of 2023 & 2024, guided by faculty-led didactics on neuropathology MRI. Among the 56 annotators, 14 select volunteers were then paired with neuroradiology faculty for guided one-on-one annotation sessions for BraTS 2025. Lectures on neuroanatomy, pathology & AI, journal clubs & data scientist-led workshops were organized online. Annotators & audience members completed surveys on their perceived knowledge before & after annotations & lectures respectively. Fourteen coordinators, each paired with a neuroradiologist, completed the data annotation process, averaging 1322.9+/-760.7 hours per dataset per pair and 1200 segmentations in total. On a scale of 1-10, annotation coordinators reported significant increase in familiarity with image segmentation software pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6+/-2.9 to final average of 8.9+/-1.1, and significant increase in familiarity with brain tumor features pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6.2+/-2.4 to final average of 8.1+/-1.2. We demonstrate an innovative offering for providing neuroradiology & AI education through an image segmentation challenge to enhance understanding of algorithm development, reinforce the concept of data reference standard, and diversify opportunities for AI-driven image analysis among future physicians.

Abstract: Given a set of graphs from some unknown family, we want to generate new graphs from that family. Recent methods use diffusion on either graph embeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges. However, simple changes to embeddings (say, adding noise) can mean uninterpretable changes in the graph. In discrete-space diffusion, each step may add or remove many nodes/edges. It is hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion steps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We separate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the training graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then generate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk "trajectories" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal graph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly, which improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world benchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods. The most significant differences are on large-scale graph structures such as PageRank, cuts, communities, degree distributions, and flows. GraphWeave is also 10x faster than its closest competitor. Finally, GraphWeave is simple, needing only a transformer and standard optimizers.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of personalized cardiovascular dynamics is crucial for non-invasive monitoring and therapy planning. State-of-the-art physics-informed neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We investigate physics-informed neural operator learning models as efficient supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet) on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operator-supervised approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766 vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization coefficient and decreasing training overhead by 4%. Our results demonstrate that operator-based supervision effectively replaces intricate multi-component training strategies, offering a more scalable and interpretable approach to physiological modeling with reduced implementation burden.

Abstract: Performative prediction (PP) is an algorithmic framework for optimizing machine learning (ML) models where the model's deployment affects the distribution of the data it is trained on. Compared to traditional ML with fixed data, designing algorithms in PP converging to a stable point -- known as a stationary performative stable (SPS) solution -- is more challenging than the counterpart in conventional ML tasks due to the model-induced distribution shifts. While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using methods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient descent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a recent work established $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS solutions under smooth, non-convex losses. However, this latest progress is still based on the restricted bounded variance assumption in stochastic gradient estimates and yields convergence bounds with a non-vanishing error neighborhood that scales with the variance. This limitation motivates us to improve convergence rates and reduce error in stochastic optimization for PP, particularly in non-convex settings. Thus, we propose a new algorithm called stochastic performative prediction with variance reduction (SPRINT) and establish its convergence to an SPS solution at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. Notably, the resulting error neighborhood is **independent** of the variance of the stochastic gradients. Experiments on multiple real datasets with non-convex models demonstrate that SPRINT outperforms SGD-GD in both convergence rate and stability.

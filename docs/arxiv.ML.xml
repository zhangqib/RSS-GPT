<div> Keywords: Multi-Task Learning, Neural Combinatorial Optimization, Vehicle Routing Problem, Reinforcement Learning, Knowledge Distillation

Summary:
Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) aims to train a single model to solve various Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. Existing RL-based methods struggle with generalization on large-scale problems. A novel approach, MTL-KD, uses knowledge distillation to efficiently train heavy decoder models with improved generalization. MTL-KD transfers policy knowledge from single-task models to enhance performance across tasks. An adaptive inference strategy, Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), tailored for VRP tasks, further enhances the model's performance. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants demonstrate the superior and robust generalization abilities of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, chess, human concepts, transformer, conceptual understanding

Summary:
Artificial intelligence systems have been developed to play chess at a grandmaster level, but a study reveals that while these systems perform well, they may not truly understand human concepts. The analysis shows that early layers of the system can accurately encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts, but deeper layers diverge towards alien representations, indicating a shift away from human understanding. To test the system's conceptual robustness, a Chess960 dataset is introduced, revealing a reliance on memorized patterns rather than genuine understanding when opening theory is eliminated. This tension between game-winning representations and human-aligned thinking poses a challenge for AI applications that require collaboration with humans. As AI systems prioritize performance, they may develop increasingly alien intelligence, highlighting the need for genuine human-AI collaboration in creative AI applications. The dataset and code for further exploration are available for study. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to 85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240 expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops 10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring genuine human-AI collaboration.

<div> Keywords: distributed machine learning, gradient sparsification, ARC-Top-K, All-Reduce, convergence rates <br />
Summary: 
Communication bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine learning is addressed through gradient sparsification. Existing compressors like Rand-K and Top-K have limitations, prompting the development of ARC-Top-K. This new compressor aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight gradient sketch, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant information. ARC-Top-K is provably contractive and, when combined with momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates than the original EF21M. Empirical results show that ARC-Top-K matches the accuracy of Top-K while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 60.7%. This efficient and scalable solution combines the robustness of Rand-K with the strong performance of Top-K. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable limitations: Rand-$K$ discards structural information and performs poorly in practice, while Top-$K$ preserves informative entries but loses the contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper, we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant information. ARC-Top-$K$ is provably contractive and, when combined with momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions. Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$ while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$ with the strong performance of Top-$K$.

Summary: <br />
Developing efficient CUDA kernels is crucial for AI applications but manual design is time-consuming, leading to the need for automatic approaches like CudaForge. This training-free multi-agent workflow uses LLM agents to iteratively generate, correct, and optimize kernels, integrating hardware feedback for improvement. CudaForge achieves 97.6% correctness and a 1.68x speedup over PyTorch baselines, outperforming existing models. It also demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs and base models while maintaining efficiency. Generating an optimized kernel with CudaForge is cost-effective and takes significantly less time compared to other methods. This research showcases the effectiveness of utilizing multi-agent, training-free workflows for high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. <div>
arXiv:2511.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation, however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3, achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$ speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed, CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4, QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$ 0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and multi-task learning baselines.

<div> Keywords: Classification, Evaluation measure, Eigenvalues entropy, Imbalanced classes, Performance

Summary:
Classification is a crucial method in machine learning for various applications, but existing evaluation measures may be less accurate for datasets with imbalanced classes. This paper proposes using eigenvalues entropy as an evaluation measure for binary or multi-class classification problems. It establishes relationships between eigenvalues and commonly used measures like sensitivity, specificity, AUC-ROC, and the Gini index for binary problems. Additionally, it provides an estimate of the confusion matrix to address imbalanced class issues. The study demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed evaluation measure over standard measures through various data examples. Overall, the eigenvalues entropy offers a more effective approach for evaluating classification methods, particularly in the presence of imbalanced classes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition, pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem, relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures, the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the literature.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization. However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent (SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to control and enhance model behavior.

Summary:
Neural Green's Function is introduced as a neural solution operator for linear partial differential equations with eigendecompositions. It mimics the behavior of Green's functions, achieving superior generalization across irregular geometries and diverse source and boundary functions. By extracting per-point features from a volumetric point cloud and predicting a solution operator decomposition, Neural Green's Function enables efficient and robust generalization to unseen functions. In thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries, it outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators with an average error reduction of 13.9% across various shape categories. Additionally, it is up to 350 times faster than traditional numerical solvers that require computationally expensive meshing. <div>
arXiv:2511.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions. Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization. In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators, achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories, while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires computationally expensive meshing.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces DeepContour, a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and Kernel Density Estimation to solve large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) efficiently. The DeepContour framework utilizes a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict the spectral distribution of a given GEP and then applies Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to determine proper integration contours. By optimizing the integration contours, DeepContour significantly accelerates GEP solving, achieving up to a 5.63x speedup in multiple datasets. This approach addresses the challenge of selecting integration contours without prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution, enhancing computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. DeepContour leverages the strengths of deep learning and classical solvers to provide a robust and efficient method for solving challenging GEPs involving high-dimensional matrices. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets, achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue involving matrices of high dimension.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality. A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior. Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Summary:
FineXL introduces a technique for Fine-grained eXplainability in natural Language for personalized image generation models. It aims to provide detailed explanations in natural language about the different aspects of personalization in generated images, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect. Existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited in their ability to identify multiple aspects and varying levels of personalization accurately. FineXL addresses this limitation and enhances the accuracy of explainability by 56% across various personalization scenarios applied to different image generation models. This new technique enables users to better understand how their personalized models are tailored to meet their individual needs. <div>
arXiv:2511.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.

Summary:  
- The study focuses on enhancing language models through reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning and generalization abilities.  
- A dynamic reward design is proposed for rule-based RL to shift rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns.  
- The Tool-Zero series models are introduced to train LLMs to use general tools independently without post-training.  
- Experimental results show over 7% performance improvement compared to supervised fine-tuning and RL-with-SFT models.  
- The gains are consistent across different dataset evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our methods.

Summary: 
This study introduces a systematic model using machine learning to determine sample size in qualitative research, aiming to enhance objectivity in the process. A dataset from five qualitative research approaches was utilized to develop an ensemble learning model that evaluated ten critical parameters. ML algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree showed high explanatory power in modeling qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis highlighted the significance of research design type and information power. The study proposes a web-based computational application as a decision support system for qualitative researchers. This model contributes to standardizing sample size justification, increasing transparency, and improving the epistemological foundation of qualitative inquiry through evidence-based decision-making. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation, which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory, Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope, information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~ 0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

<div> Keywords: large language models, reinforcement learning, reasoning, model efficiency, brevity

Summary:
Large language models trained for step-by-step reasoning often suffer from verbosity, leading to increased inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods filter out easy problems during training, causing models to primarily focus on harder tasks and potentially inflate output length. By incorporating moderately easy problems and implicitly regularizing output length, models can learn to solve harder tasks without verbose outputs. This approach, termed 'emergent brevity for free', results in improved accuracy on challenging tasks without explicit length penalization. Experimental results on the Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 dataset demonstrate that models trained using this method achieve baseline pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are nearly twice as short on average. The code is available on GitHub, with datasets and models accessible through Hugging Face.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with ``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer. Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is \textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on \textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly twice as short. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/MBZUAI-Paris/Frugal-AI}{GitHub}, with datasets and models on \href{https://huggingface.co/collections/MBZUAI-Paris/k2-think-mini-68dcfa8b114686a4bd3dc2bc}{Hugging Face}.

<div> Keywords: grokking, neural networks, generalization, weight decay, representation learning <br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper investigates the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks, where delayed generalization occurs after memorizing training data. The study suggests that post-memorization learning can be explained by constrained optimization, with gradient descent minimizing weight norms on the zero-loss manifold. The research proves this concept in the context of infinitesimally small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. By introducing a parameter decoupling approximation, the paper derives a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network. Experiments validate that simulating training using predicted gradients replicates the delayed generalization and representation learning observed in grokking. This work sheds light on the underlying dynamics of grokking and provides insights into how neural networks achieve full generalization after a delay. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

Summary:<br />
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease with a short lifespan post-symptom onset.
- Current treatments have limited effectiveness, underscoring the need for personalized patient care.
- Research on ALS is hindered by small and diverse study groups, insufficient longitudinal data, and a lack of clear patient cluster definitions.
- The proposed clustering approach integrates medical expertise and utilizes multiple variables to group sequences based on disease progression scores.
- The approach outperforms existing methods in survival analysis and offers more interpretable results for medical professionals. <div>

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small, heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition, the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for medical experts.

Summary:<br />
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are explored as promising adsorbents for gas adsorption and separation. A new universal COFs adsorption prediction framework (COFAP) utilizes deep learning to extract multi-modal structural and chemical features. COFAP outperforms previous approaches without relying on specific gas-related features such as Henry coefficients or adsorption heat. It was found that high-performing COFs for separation tend to have specific characteristics like a narrow range of pore size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme was developed to assist researchers in ranking candidate COFs based on application-specific criteria. The efficiency and accuracy of COFAP make it a valuable tool for identifying optimal COF structures for various gas adsorption and separation applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features. However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern, demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of 0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of 80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Summary: 
The study introduces the EchoLSTM, a novel architectural design incorporating Output-Conditioned Gating to enhance memory retention in neural networks. This self-reflective mechanism enables the model to modulate internal memory gates based on past inferences, creating a stabilizing feedback loop. The EchoLSTM outperforms standard LSTMs by 33 percentage points in a Distractor Signal Task, achieving 69.0% accuracy. On the ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM competes with a Transformer model, achieving 69.8% accuracy while being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. Lastly, the Trigger Sensitivity Test demonstrates that the EchoLSTM's self-reflective mechanism leads to a more robust memory system. <div>
arXiv:2511.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle, Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy, decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points. Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

Summary:
The article introduces a new unsupervised EEG/LFP preprocessing method called the NeuroClean pipeline. This method aims to automate the conditioning of brain data recordings by removing artifacts and noise sources. The pipeline consists of five steps including bandpass filtering, line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. It utilizes independent component analysis with automatic component rejection based on a clustering algorithm to ensure relevant information is preserved. Validation experiments showed that NeuroClean successfully removed common artifacts from the signal and significantly improved accuracy in motor tasks after cleaning the data. Specifically, the cleaned data achieved over 97% accuracy in a Multinomial Logistic Regression model compared to 74% accuracy with raw data. This promising pipeline demonstrates the potential for enhancing the generalization and performance of machine learning pipelines in future research studies.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications. However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline. NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover, in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97% accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called the bulk-boundary decomposition to analyze the training dynamics of deep neural networks. It reorganizes the Lagrangian of stochastic gradient descent into a bulk term, representing intrinsic dynamics determined by network architecture and activation functions, and a boundary term, reflecting stochastic interactions from training samples at input and output layers. This decomposition reveals the local and homogeneous structure within deep networks. The authors also develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on this decomposition, offering a deeper understanding of network behavior. <div>

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on this decomposition.

Speculative decoding speeds up LLMs by using a draft model to generate tokens before verification. The challenge is determining the optimal number of tokens to draft. TapOut is a training-free algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using multi-armed bandits. It selects among multiple strategies based on past rewards and exploration, outperforming existing methods without hyperparameter tuning. <div>
arXiv:2511.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free, plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any hyperparameter tuning.

Summary:
This study investigates emergent misalignment (EM) in large language models, where harmful behaviors can arise after fine-tuning on specific datasets. The research takes a geometric approach to understand how harmful behavior is encoded across different tasks. The findings reveal a linear structure in EM parameters across tasks, indicating shared parameter directions that lead to broad misalignment. The study demonstrates strong convergence in EM parameters and functional equivalence through linear mode connectivity, showing how interpolated models maintain harmful behaviors. The results suggest that harmful behaviors may be organized into specific regions of the weight landscape. By uncovering the connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, this research paves the way for further exploration of parameter space interpretability and interventions based on weight analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability and weight-based interventions.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel path-coordinated framework for continual learning to address catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. By combining NTK theory, Wilson confidence intervals, and multiple metrics evaluation, the framework achieves an average accuracy of 66.7% with only 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10. The use of NTK condition numbers as predictive indicators reveals a critical threshold for learning capacity limits. Additionally, the proposed strategy demonstrates a trend of decreasing forgetting as tasks progress, indicating system stabilization. The framework validates 80% of discovered paths statistically and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. Analysis of core capacity limits provides valuable insights for enhancing adaptive regularization in continual learning environments. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are offered.

Summary: 
The article introduces RobustFSM, a solution for federated submodular maximization that addresses client misbehaviors in a decentralized setting where clients have their definitions for data representability. The solution aims to protect against malicious clients sharing fake information, similar to backdoor attacks in federated learning. RobustFSM is designed to maintain the privacy and autonomy of clients while ensuring the quality of the representation subset. Empirical evaluation using real-world datasets demonstrates that RobustFSM outperforms conventional federated algorithms when facing severe attacks, with improvements in solution quality reaching up to 200%. This robust solution offers a practical approach to submodular maximization in federated settings, providing a reliable way to aggregate local information accurately and efficiently. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning, but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

Summary:<br />
Predicting interspecies interactions in microbial communities is essential for understanding their structure and function. Using a dataset of over 7,500 pairwise interactions between 20 species under different conditions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were employed to predict the direction and type of these interactions. By constructing edge-graphs of microbial interactions and leveraging shared information across experiments, the GNN model achieved an F1-score of 80.44%, outperforming conventional methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting. The model not only classified interactions as positive or negative but also captured more complex types like mutualism, competition, and parasitism. This approach shows promise in improving our understanding of microbial communities and their dynamics. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology, as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2) quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion), while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical methods.

<div> Attention, Large Language Models, Flashlight, PyTorch, FlexAttention<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Flashlight, a compiler-native framework integrated into the PyTorch ecosystem. Flashlight automates the generation of fused, FlashAttention-style kernels for various attention-based programs. It eliminates the need for static templates or predefined kernel specializations, making it easier to support different attention variants efficiently. Flashlight uses PyTorch's compilation workflow to seamlessly fuse and tile attention computations, resulting in competitive or superior performance compared to FlexAttention. Additionally, Flashlight offers the flexibility of native PyTorch code, allowing developers to quickly experiment with new attention models without compromising on performance. The framework supports not only all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but also handles more complex, data-dependent attention formulations. Overall, Flashlight enhances the efficiency of attention mechanisms in large language models, promoting faster exploration and development of diverse attention patterns. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency. Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently, enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models without sacrificing performance.

<div> model, fine-tuning, classification, explanations, random tokens

Summary: 
The study explores the impact of attaching explanations to labels during fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks. The research investigates conversational response quality in terms of naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence. By incorporating brief explanations along with labels, the 7B-parameter model outperforms label-only baselines across six diverse conversational datasets. Surprisingly, even using syntactically incoherent pseudo-explanations yields improved accuracy over label-only training, indicating the importance of token-level structure in computation. This approach encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a regularizer to reduce over-confident shortcuts. Internal analyses reveal higher activation entropy in intermediate layers and sharper predictive mass at the output layer, suggesting increased deliberation before decision-making. Ultimately, explanation-augmented fine-tuning enhances classification accuracy and reliability, shedding light on how token-level scaffolding influences computation during inference. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels. We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on 5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets. Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds, indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework designed for optimizing wearable sensor use and automatically auditing data integrity in objective gait analysis for managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. The framework was applied to a multi-cohort gait dataset, revealing a severe dataset confound related to bilateral assessment in OA and CVA screening tasks. The model highlighted a laterality bias, with 70% attention on the Right Foot and almost none on the Left Foot due to a skewed dataset (e.g., all right-sided OA cases). This methodology showcases the framework's capability to detect hidden biases and propose optimized sensor synergies, such as using Head plus Foot for PD screening, as potential protocols for future studies.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor. Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI [0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset. The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized protocols.

Summary: <br />
This paper presents a novel solver for maximizing real-valued functions with binary variables. The solver utilizes an algorithm that estimates optimal objective-function values by training an estimator on the distribution of objectives and sub-instances. Instead of calculating values of policies or relying on solved instances, the estimator is trained using an inequality that employs the expected total deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function. This approach allows for efficient estimation without directly computing the objective-function itself. The solver represents a new method for tackling optimization problems involving binary variables and real-valued functions, presenting a promising direction for future research in this area. <div>

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor does it rely on solved instances.

Summary: 
Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are advancing to compete with autoregressive models, but face challenges with fixed step decoding. To address this, One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT) is introduced, which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence for subsequent inputs with minimal overhead. OSDT outperforms existing methods on various datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval, achieving higher accuracy-throughput trade-offs. Notably, OSDT shows significant improvements, such as a 24% increase in tokens per second on GSM8K and a 50% increase on HumanEval with a slight accuracy gap. The study suggests the potential for leveraging task-level confidence signatures for broader algorithmic and systems advancements in diffusion decoding. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24% tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy, and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems innovations in diffusion decoding.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a framework that incorporates physical knowledge directly into the loss function for tasks involving molecules and spins. It proposes deriving energy loss functions based on the assumption that each data sample is in thermal equilibrium with an approximate energy landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution, the loss function is obtained as an energy difference between the data and model predictions. This approach provides physically grounded loss functions that align better with valid configurations, are architecture-agnostic, and computationally efficient. The energy-based formulation respects physical symmetries and offers improvements over traditional objectives like MSE. The framework is demonstrated on molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction tasks, showcasing significant enhancements over existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level. In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant improvements over baselines.

arXiv:2511.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

<br />Summary:
The proposed framework for world modeling aims to standardize architectures based on discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics, dynamics). By utilizing Hidden Markov Models and switching linear dynamical systems as building blocks, the architecture supports both passive modeling and active control. The approach avoids combinatorial explosion by limiting the search to four depth parameters. The framework demonstrates practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling and planning from pixels. Scalable joint structure-parameter learning remains a core challenge, with existing methods incrementally growing structure and parameters. If solved, these building blocks could serve as foundational infrastructure for world modeling, similar to standardized layers in deep learning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture: discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics, dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters. We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling (passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

Summary: 
Machine Learning in fusion research is becoming increasingly important, but traditional models struggle with non-stationary data caused by experimental evolution and machine wear. This paper explores the use of online learning techniques, previously unexplored in fusion applications, to adapt to drifting data streams. The study focuses on predicting Toroidal Field coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion facility and shows that online learning significantly improves model performance, reducing error by 80% compared to static models. To address short-term performance degradation, an uncertainty-guided online ensemble method is proposed. This method uses Deep Gaussian Process Approximation for uncertainty estimation and guides a meta-algorithm to produce predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different historical data horizons. The uncertainty-guided online ensemble further reduces prediction errors by approximately 10% compared to standard online learning with a single model. <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams. Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model. Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and 10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

<div> leverage scores, data valuation, Shapley valuation, training, active learning <br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a geometric approach to data valuation based on statistical leverage scores as an alternative to the computationally complex Shapley data valuation. The proposed ridge leverage scores measure each data point's influence in the representation space, providing a connection to classical optimal design criteria. The study proves that training on a subset sampled using leverage scores yields a model with parameters and predictive risk close to the full-data optimum. Additionally, an active learning experiment demonstrates that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms standard baselines without gradient information. This approach bridges the gap between data valuation and decision quality in downstream applications. <div>
arXiv:2511.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data, making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

- Geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed location inputs into high-dimensional embeddings using Earth data. 
- The study examines the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic INRs which ranges between 2 and 10, influenced by spatial resolution and input modalities. 
- The intrinsic dimension correlates with task performance and helps identify spatial artifacts in the models. 
- This metric provides a label-free measure of information content for unsupervised evaluation and pre-training design of INRs. 
- The research offers a framework-agnostic approach for assessing model performance and improving training strategies in Earth observation representation learning. <div>
arXiv:2511.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation, geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact, learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability, regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training. Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts, facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

<div> robustness, optimization landscape, non-convex optimization, noisy matrix sensing, mean squared error (MSE) loss

Summary:
This paper investigates the impact of different loss functions on the robustness and optimization landscape of non-convex optimization problems, using the example of noisy matrix sensing. The traditional choice of mean squared error (MSE) loss may not be reliable for non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise, prompting the adoption of a robust loss based on nonparametric regression. This robust loss, derived from a kernel-based estimate of residual density, maximizes the estimated log-likelihood and remains stable across various noise distributions. By reshaping the optimization landscape, the robust loss helps eliminate spurious local minima by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted isometry property (RIP) constants. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of this new loss function in handling large noise and enhancing the robustness of machine learning tasks. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate loss functions to improve the performance and reliability of optimization algorithms.

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape, through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions. This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and broadly applicable analytical framework.

<div> Thompson Sampling, Contextual Bandits, Regret Bound, Variance, Model Dimension

Summary: 
The paper introduces the FGTSVA algorithm, a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with a general reward function. Unlike previous studies, FGTSVA achieves an optimal regret bound that considers the complexity of the model space. By extending the decoupling coefficient technique, FGTSVA is able to achieve a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$ which takes into account the model space size, the total number of rounds, and the subgaussian norm of the noise. In the context of contextual linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms using weighted linear regression. Overall, FGTSVA provides a promising approach for variance-aware Thompson Sampling in contextual bandit settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$, where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g., variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Summary:<br />
A hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) is proposed for early detection of cardiac abnormalities. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are transformed into 2D images using wavelet feature extraction and adaptive threshold compression. The compressed images, with only 8 qubits required for the quantum stage, enable efficient classification of S3 and murmur abnormalities. Results on the HLS-CMDS dataset show 93.33% accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, indicating the model's ability to capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical signals.

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3 and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an 8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage. Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare environments.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS, a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings. Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Summary:
In the realm of machine learning, the distribution shift problem poses a significant challenge for the deployment of ML models in real-world applications. This issue can result in severe consequences, especially in high-risk scenarios. Traditionally, statistical methods like Kullback-Leibler and Wasserstein distance have been used to quantify distribution shift. However, a new approach using Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain technique has emerged as a powerful tool for measuring distribution shift in high-dimensional spaces and for facilitating domain adaptation. This letter highlights the effectiveness of the CF method in addressing the distribution shift problem and emphasizes its potential in enhancing the performance of ML models in practical applications. <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper, we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable results accessible to domain experts.

<div> Keywords: air quality forecasting, spatiotemporal data, Bayesian neural network, missing data patterns, deep learning

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called CGLUBNF for accurate air quality forecasting despite missing observational data. CGLUBNF utilizes Fourier features and a graph attention encoder to capture spatial dependencies and seasonal dynamics. It includes a channel gated learning unit with learnable activations and gated residual connections to enhance feature filtering and amplification. Bayesian inference is used to optimize predictive distributions and parameter uncertainty, providing both point estimates and calibrated prediction intervals. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that CGLUBNF outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and confidence interval sharpness. The model is also robust across various prediction horizons and can handle multiple missing data patterns. This research paves the way for accurate spatio-temporal forecasting in scenarios with incomplete observations, such as vehicle-borne mobile monitoring. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

Summary:
OmniField addresses challenges in multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data by leveraging a continuity-aware framework. The framework learns a continuous neural field that adapts to sparse, irregular, and noisy within-modality measurements, while also handling varying modalities across space and time. By utilizing a multimodal crosstalk block architecture and iterative cross-modal refinement, OmniField aligns signals prior to decoding, enabling tasks such as reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without the need for gridding or pre-processing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OmniField outperforms eight strong baselines in multimodal spatiotemporal learning. Additionally, the framework exhibits robustness to heavy simulated sensor noise, with performance remaining close to clean-input levels even under such conditions. Overall, OmniField provides a promising solution for effectively handling cross-modal data in real-world scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse, irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context. A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines. Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a framework that enhances policy learning in agents by learning structured representations of objects and their interactions. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics using disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, leading to improved sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. The model learns object-centric latents and interaction structures directly from pixels with pre-trained vision encoders. Tasks are decomposed into interaction primitives, allowing for a hierarchical policy where a high level selects the type and order of interactions, while a low level executes them. FIOC-WM outperforms world-model baselines on simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, demonstrating the significance of explicit, modular interaction learning for robust control. <div>

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

<div> Mixture-of-Experts, Autoregressive generation, Token-to-expert mapping, Latency reduction, Quality preservation  
Summary:  
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in Large Language Models (LLMs) can face memory-bound challenges during autoregressive generation. This study introduces a dynamic token-to-expert mapping framework to lower decode latency while maintaining quality. By using batch-aware routing, tokens can share experts already loaded into memory, reducing the number of activated experts and thereby decreasing latency. Experimental results on Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with a batch size of 16 show latency reductions of 39% and 15% in the MoE layer decode latency without significant accuracy loss. This approach efficiently optimizes expert usage in MoE architectures for improved performance in LLMs.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency) while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch. Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy, our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer decode latency, respectively.

Summary: 
Neural network parameter initialization plays a critical role in learning performance, potentially eliminating the need for backpropagation training. Existing algorithms like ridgelet transform and SWIM have been used for initialization. Neural networks tend to learn coarse information in early layers, known as spectral bias. This study investigates leveraging spectral bias information in initialization to improve network performance. A framework is proposed to adjust scale factors in the SWIM algorithm to represent low-frequency components in early layers and high-frequency components in later layers. Numerical experiments on regression and classification tasks show the proposed method outperforms conventional initialization techniques. The research underscores the significance of intrinsic spectral properties in neural network learning and offers an effective strategy for parameter initialization to enhance training outcomes.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their training performance.

Summary: 
This paper investigates online learning with H\"older smooth functions, which includes both smooth and non-smooth functions. The study shows a close connection between accelerated optimization and gradient-variation online learning, with the former being understood through the lens of the latter. For strongly convex online functions, a gradient-variation online learning algorithm is designed to achieve optimal guarantees in both smooth and non-smooth regimes. The algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter, showcasing adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch conversion, a universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness is achieved. The integration of online adaptivity with a detection-based guess-and-check procedure results in a universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth regime. <div>
arXiv:2511.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization, and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning. Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz) functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For (strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter, exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness. However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel method that combines reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian filtering for state estimation in scenarios where the underlying dynamics are unknown. By treating the parameter estimation process as a sequential decision-making problem, the method formulates it as a discrete-time Markov decision process. This approach allows for learning a surrogate state transition model directly from noisy observations without relying on noise-free ground-truth state sequences. Once the model is trained offline, state estimation can be performed in real-time using filtering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework is versatile and applicable to a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and partially observed measurement models. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings. <div>

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end, various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories. Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

arXiv:2511.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

arXiv:2511.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors, degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

<title>Large-scale automatic carbon ion treatment planning for head and neck cancers via parallel multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45 TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE) QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2) apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10 testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL $85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05) improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

<title>RoME: Domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts for MILP Solution Prediction across Domains</title>

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains. Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often struggle to generalize.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL, instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Reducing normalizing flow complexity for MCMC preconditioning</title>

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and software strides in neural MCMC design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight, real-time motion recognition system that enables synergic human-machine performance through wearable IMU sensor data, MiniRocket time-series classification, and responsive multimedia control. By mapping dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution perspective.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error. Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94), graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

<title>H-Infinity Filter Enhanced CNN-LSTM for Arrhythmia Detection from Heart Sound Recordings</title>

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization. Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

arXiv:2511.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion, relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

arXiv:2511.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in, as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to be false positives. However, these analyses do not take \emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

<title>SKGE: Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding with Geometric Regularization</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training. In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237 and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally, we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful and stable KGE models.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis, finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring. BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk. Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base. These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in the field.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta * C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality, enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck (V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall, V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable structure.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve. With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants, while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper, we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP (OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and OCLRP.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.

Abstract: We study a many-to-one matching problem, such as the college admission problem, where each college can admit multiple students. Unlike classical models, colleges evaluate sets of students through non-linear utility functions that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

<title>Theoretical Guarantees for Causal Discovery on Large Random Graphs</title>

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) -- the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies $\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with $\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive, faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in practice as dimensionality grows.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint, though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling. Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning (ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint. Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited data.

<title>Dynamic Priors in Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Optimization</title>

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However, these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions. To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors, leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

<title>Directional-Clamp PPO</title>

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization. This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm (DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong" direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components) has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method. Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

<title>A Non-Adversarial Approach to Idempotent Generative Modelling</title>

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives, which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs) to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well as an energy-based model.

<title>Recursively Enumerably Representable Classes and Computable Versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER) classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one, even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However, transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.
  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size. These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.
  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces, achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL) algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result. While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning, we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons, and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts. However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time, general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a 23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained deployment.

<title>Does Interpretability of Knowledge Tracing Models Support Teacher Decision Making?</title>

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward: teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use KT models.

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random, ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate. This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically, when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

<title>From Solo to Symphony: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Collaboration with Single-Agent Demos</title>

arXiv:2511.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g., collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such, VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE (Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder), a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are: (i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD. More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise, SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$, whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo, and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

<title>Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning (ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs), thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii) adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10 dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

<title>Can LLMs subtract numbers?</title>

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs). While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative, yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However, proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice, and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains. However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune .

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win. Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance; generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third, the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

<title>In Good GRACEs: Principled Teacher Selection for Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model. GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86% Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

Abstract: We propose the use of the ``spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning (ML) input data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised ML, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions, and in a regression task to predict non-local observables. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Importantly, we illustrate a clear advantage of spin-opstring over conventional spin configurations in the accurate prediction of a quantum phase transition. Finally, we show how the inherent structure of spin-opstring provides an elegant framework for the interpretability of ML predictions. Using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the ML models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for ML in quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.

Abstract: Bond markets respond differently to macroeconomic news compared to equity markets, yet most sentiment models, including FinBERT, are trained primarily on general financial or equity news data. This mismatch is important because bond prices often move in the opposite direction to economic optimism, making general or equity-based sentiment tools potentially misleading. In this paper, we introduce BondBERT, a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on bond-specific news. BondBERT can act as the perception and reasoning component of a financial decision-support agent, providing sentiment signals that integrate with forecasting models. It is a generalisable framework for adapting transformers to low-volatility, domain-inverse sentiment tasks by compiling and cleaning 30,000 UK bond market articles (2018--2025) for training, validation, and testing. We compare BondBERT's sentiment predictions against FinBERT, FinGPT, and Instruct-FinGPT using event-based correlation, up/down accuracy analyses, and LSTM forecasting across ten UK sovereign bonds. We find that BondBERT consistently produces positive correlations with bond returns, achieves higher alignment and forecasting accuracy than the three baseline models, with lower normalised RMSE and higher information coefficient. These results demonstrate that domain-specific sentiment adaptation better captures fixed income dynamics, bridging a gap between NLP advances and bond market analytics.

Abstract: To study how the human brain works, we need to explore the organization of the cerebral cortex and its detailed cellular architecture. We introduce CytoNet, a foundation model that encodes high-resolution microscopic image patches of the cerebral cortex into highly expressive feature representations, enabling comprehensive brain analyses. CytoNet employs self-supervised learning using spatial proximity as a powerful training signal, without requiring manual labelling. The resulting features are anatomically sound and biologically relevant. They encode general aspects of cortical architecture and unique brain-specific traits. We demonstrate top-tier performance in tasks such as cortical area classification, cortical layer segmentation, cell morphology estimation, and unsupervised brain region mapping. As a foundation model, CytoNet offers a consistent framework for studying cortical microarchitecture, supporting analyses of its relationship with other structural and functional brain features, and paving the way for diverse neuroscientific investigations.

Abstract: Mapping a dataflow-graph of an ML model onto a reconfigurable system is difficult, as different mappings have different throughputs and consume resource constraints differently. To solve this, a model to evaluate the throughput of mappings is necessary as measuring throughput completely is expensive. Many use a hand-designed analytical model, relying on proxy features or intuition, introducing error. We provide a Learned Approach that predicts throughput 31%-52% more accurately over a variety of graphs. In addition, our approach shows no accuracy degradation after removing performance annotations. We show that using this approach results in 5.6% faster compiled graphs.

Abstract: Solar-flare forecasting has been extensively researched yet remains an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of elastic distance measures for detecting patterns in the solar-flare dataset, SWAN-SF. We employ a simple $k$-medoids clustering algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced, high-dimensional distance metrics. Our results show that, despite thorough optimization, none of the elastic distances outperform Euclidean distance by a significant margin. We demonstrate that, although elastic measures have shown promise for univariate time series, when applied to the multivariate time series of SWAN-SF, characterized by the high stochasticity of solar activity, they effectively collapse to Euclidean distance. We conduct thousands of experiments and present both quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting this finding.

Abstract: Access to clinical multi-channel EEG remains limited in many regions worldwide. We present NEUROSKY-EPI, the first open dataset of single-channel, consumer-grade EEG for epilepsy, collected in a South Asian clinical setting along with rich contextual metadata. To explore its utility, we introduce EmbedCluster, a patient-stratification pipeline that transfers representations from EEGNet models trained on clinical data and enriches them with contextual autoencoder embeddings, followed by unsupervised clustering of patients based on EEG patterns. Results show that low-cost, single-channel data can support meaningful stratification. Beyond algorithmic performance, we emphasize human-centered concerns such as deployability in resource-constrained environments, interpretability for non-specialists, and safeguards for privacy, inclusivity, and bias. By releasing the dataset and code, we aim to catalyze interdisciplinary research across health technology, human-computer interaction, and machine learning, advancing the goal of affordable and actionable EEG-based epilepsy care.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities, aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks: (1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge, evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the great potential of flow matching-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image editing. However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient solution without compromising editing quality.

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

<title>Delta-learned force fields for nonbonded interactions: Addressing the strength mismatch between covalent-nonbonded interaction for global models</title>

Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding, ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water, and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to \textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while preserving the quality of the inference.

<title>Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation</title>

arXiv:2511.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows. We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes involved.

Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli, Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local "decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models, stability of data distributions implies the existence of computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.

Abstract: Physical symmetries provide a strong inductive bias for constructing functions to analyze data. In particular, this bias may improve robustness, data efficiency, and interpretability of machine learning models. However, building machine learning models that explicitly respect symmetries can be difficult due to the dedicated components required. Moreover, real-world experiments may not exactly respect fundamental symmetries at the level of finite granularities and energy thresholds. In this work, we explore an alternative approach to create symmetry-aware machine learning models. We introduce soft constraints that allow the model to decide the importance of added symmetries during the learning process instead of enforcing exact symmetries. We investigate two complementary approaches, one that penalizes the model based on specific transformations of the inputs and one inspired by group theory and infinitesimal transformations of the inputs. Using top quark jet tagging and Lorentz equivariance as examples, we observe that the addition of the soft constraints leads to more robust performance while requiring negligible changes to current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We present a scalable recommender system implementation based on RippleNet, tailored for the media domain with a production deployment in Onet.pl, one of Poland's largest online media platforms. Our solution addresses the cold-start problem for newly published content by integrating content-based item embeddings into the knowledge propagation mechanism of RippleNet, enabling effective scoring of previously unseen items. The system architecture leverages Amazon SageMaker for distributed training and inference, and Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines and model retraining workflows. To ensure high-quality training data, we constructed a comprehensive golden dataset consisting of user and item features and a separate interaction table, all enabling flexible extensions and integration of new signals.

<title>Data-driven Learning of Interaction Laws in Multispecies Particle Systems with Gaussian Processes: Convergence Theory and Applications</title>

Abstract: We develop a Gaussian process framework for learning interaction kernels in multi-species interacting particle systems from trajectory data. Such systems provide a canonical setting for multiscale modeling, where simple microscopic interaction rules generate complex macroscopic behaviors. While our earlier work established a Gaussian process approach and convergence theory for single-species systems, and later extended to second-order models with alignment and energy-type interactions, the multi-species setting introduces new challenges: heterogeneous populations interact both within and across species, the number of unknown kernels grows, and asymmetric interactions such as predator-prey dynamics must be accommodated. We formulate the learning problem in a nonparametric Bayesian setting and establish rigorous statistical guarantees. Our analysis shows recoverability of the interaction kernels, provides quantitative error bounds, and proves statistical optimality of posterior estimators, thereby unifying and generalizing previous single-species theory. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its advantages over existing kernel-based methods. This work contributes a complete statistical framework for data-driven inference of interaction laws in multi-species systems, advancing the broader multiscale modeling program of connecting microscopic particle dynamics with emergent macroscopic behavior.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3) adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time upfront.

Abstract: The rise of disaggregated AI GPUs has exposed a critical bottleneck in large-scale attention workloads: non-uniform memory access (NUMA). As multi-chiplet designs become the norm for scaling compute capabilities, memory latency and bandwidth vary sharply across compute regions, undermining the performance of traditional GPU kernel scheduling strategies that assume uniform memory access. We identify how these NUMA effects distort locality in multi-head attention (MHA) and present Swizzled Head-first Mapping, a spatially-aware scheduling strategy that aligns attention heads with GPU NUMA domains to exploit intra-chiplet cache reuse. On AMD's MI300X architecture, our method achieves up to 50% higher performance over state-of-the-art attention algorithms using conventional scheduling techniques and sustains consistently high L2 cache hit rates of 80-97%. These results demonstrate that NUMA-aware scheduling is now fundamental to achieving full efficiency on next-generation disaggregated GPUs, offering a path forward for scalable AI training and inference.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting increasingly demands not only accurate observational predictions but also causal forecasting under interventional and counterfactual queries in multivariate systems. We present DoFlow, a flow based generative model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions. Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the broader goal of unifying causal reasoning and generative modeling for complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: No-regret learning dynamics play a central role in game theory, enabling decentralized convergence to equilibrium for concepts such as Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) or Correlated Equilibrium (CE). In this work, we improve the convergence rate to CCE in general-sum Markov games, reducing it from the previously best-known rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to a sharper $\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$. This matches the best known convergence rate for CE in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games, and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.

Abstract: Full verification of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) has long been intractable due to challenges including black-box components and complex real-world environments. Existing tools either provide formal guarantees for limited types of systems or test the system as a monolith, but no general framework exists for compositional analysis of learning-enabled CPS using varied verification techniques over complex real-world environments. This paper introduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap. Built upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework supports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces, ranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts over those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing arbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal proofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4) systematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5) automatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level guarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study on an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor fusion. By leveraging manufacturer guarantees for radar and laser sensors and focusing testing efforts on uncertain conditions, our approach enables stronger probabilistic guarantees than monolithic testing with the same computational budget.

<title>Eliminating Multi-GPU Performance Taxes: A Systems Approach to Efficient Distributed LLMs</title>

arXiv:2511.02168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their workloads increasingly rely on distributed execution across multiple GPUs. However, the conventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings introduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these bottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel Data Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We propose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in distributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we gain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of novel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and performance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns systematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level producer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained dataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from the foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the complex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end latency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and efficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for analyzing and learning from graph-structured (GS) data, facilitating a wide range of services. Deploying such services in privacy-critical cloud environments necessitates the development of secure inference (SI) protocols that safeguard sensitive GS data. However, existing SI solutions largely focus on convolutional models for image and text data, leaving the challenge of securing GNNs and GS data relatively underexplored. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate $\sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic scheme for graph-centric inference in the cloud. By hybridizing additive and function secret sharings within secure two-party computation (2PC), $\sysname$ is carefully designed based on a series of novel 2PC interactive protocols that achieve $1.5\times \sim 1.7\times$ speedups for linear layers and $2\times \sim 15\times$ for non-linear layers over state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to prove $\sysname$'s correctness, security, and lightweight nature. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate $\sysname$'s superior efficiency with $1.3\times \sim 4.7\times$ faster secure predictions while maintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext graph property inference.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process, shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences (e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration. ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices. Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling human-centric decisions.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity (task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille, an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse, configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6 on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions, adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI agents.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1% reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types. These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code and dataset are available here: https://github.com/BBN-E/medic-neurips-2025-demo.

<title>From Models to Operators: Rethinking Autoscaling Granularity for Large Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Serving large generative models such as LLMs and multi- modal transformers requires balancing user-facing SLOs (e.g., time-to-first-token, time-between-tokens) with provider goals of efficiency and cost reduction. Existing solutions rely on static provisioning or model-level autoscaling, both of which treat the model as a monolith. This coarse-grained resource management leads to degraded performance or significant resource underutilization due to poor adaptability to dynamic inference traffic that is common online.
  The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the internal structure of generative models: they are executed as graphs of interconnected operators. Through detailed characterization and systematic analysis, we find that operators are heterogeneous in their compute and memory footprints and exhibit diverse sensitivity to workload and resource factors such as batch size, sequence length, and traffic rate. This heterogeneity suggests that the operator, rather than the entire model, is the right granularity for scaling decisions.
  We propose an operator-level autoscaling framework, which allocates resources at finer (operator)-granularity, optimizing the scaling, batching, and placement based on individual operator profiles. Evaluated on production-scale traces, our approach preserves SLOs with up to 40% fewer GPUs and 35% less energy, or under fixed resources achieves 1.6x higher throughput with 5% less energy. These results show that the operator, rather than the model, is fundamentally a more effective unit for scaling large generative workloads.

Abstract: This paper studies the high-dimensional scaling limits of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for single-layer networks. Building on the seminal work of Saad and Solla, which analyzed the deterministic (ballistic) scaling limits of SGD corresponding to the gradient flow of the population loss, we focus on the critical scaling regime of the step size. Below this critical scale, the effective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical scale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this regime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the effective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain conditions. These results highlight how the information exponent controls sample complexity and illustrates the limitations of deterministic scaling limit in capturing the stochastic fluctuations of high-dimensional learning dynamics.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time. Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents, e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and short-circuiting tasks.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting, and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of efficient sampling of Markov random fields (MRF). The sampling of Potts or Ising MRF is most often based on Gibbs sampling, and is thus computationally expensive. We consider in this work how to circumvent this bottleneck through a link with Gaussian Markov Random fields. The latter can be sampled in several cost-effective ways, and we introduce a mapping from real-valued GMRF to discrete-valued MRF. The resulting new class of MRF benefits from a few theoretical properties that validate the new model. Numerical results show the drastic performance gain in terms of computational efficiency, as we sample at least 35x faster than Gibbs sampling using at least 37x less energy, all the while exhibiting empirical properties close to classical MRFs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation. However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection, image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence. Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is publicly available from: https://github.com/Minds-R-Lab/MammoClean.

Abstract: We prove that there exist uniform $(+,\times,/)$-circuits of size $O(n^3)$ to compute the basis generating polynomial of regular matroids on $n$ elements. By tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a first example where taking the difference of two extended formulations can be more efficient than the best known individual extended formulation of size $O(n^6)$ by Aprile and Fiorini. Such differences have recently been introduced as virtual extended formulations. The proof of our main result relies on a fine-tuned version of Seymour's decomposition of regular matroids which allows us to identify and maintain graphic substructures to which we can apply a local version of the star-mesh transformation.

Abstract: Concept drift and label scarcity are two critical challenges limiting the robustness of predictive models in dynamic industrial environments. Existing drift detection methods often assume global shifts and rely on dense supervision, making them ill-suited for regression tasks with local drifts and limited labels. This paper proposes an adaptive sampling framework that combines residual-based exploration and exploitation with EWMA monitoring to efficiently detect local concept drift under labeling budget constraints. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and a case study on electricity market demonstrate superior performance in label efficiency and drift detection accuracy.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a $n$-variables $k$-CNF formula $\Phi$ from its i.i.d. uniform random solutions, which is equivalent to learning a Boolean Markov random field (MRF) with $k$-wise hard constraints. Revisiting Valiant's algorithm (Commun. ACM'84), we show that it can exactly learn (1) $k$-CNFs with bounded clause intersection size under Lov\'asz local lemma type conditions, from $O(\log n)$ samples; and (2) random $k$-CNFs near the satisfiability threshold, from $\widetilde{O}(n^{\exp(-\sqrt{k})})$ samples. These results significantly improve the previous $O(n^k)$ sample complexity. We further establish new information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity for both exact and approximate learning from i.i.d. uniform random solutions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using virtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory predictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets through conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a centralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing probabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is guided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse flight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal interception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as many-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by distributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than pursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across various target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors) demonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line prediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to 5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable effective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing interception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals, retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based autonomous decision-making.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI) is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis.

Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability, this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features. Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.

Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the local computational principles which are required to enable this function remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory - Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of different inputs to an output into unique information from each input, redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.

Abstract: As large AI models become increasingly valuable assets, the risk of model weight exfiltration from inference servers grows accordingly. An attacker controlling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them within ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work investigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and, more broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification framework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify the trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we characterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference and introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection framework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On MOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with false-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for adversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending against model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can be achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.

Abstract: We present an estimation of the condition numbers of the \emph{mass} and \emph{stiffness} matrices arising from shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks defined on the unit sphere~$\mathbb{S}^d$. In particular, when $\{\theta_j^*\}_{j=1}^n \subset \mathbb{S}^d$ is \emph{antipodally quasi-uniform}, the condition number is sharp. Indeed, in this case, we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for the full spectrum of eigenvalues and characterize the structure of the corresponding eigenspaces, showing that the smallest eigenvalues are associated with an eigenbasis of low-degree polynomials while the largest eigenvalues are linked to high-degree polynomials. This spectral analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the approximation power of the network and its numerical stability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge, delivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios. However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention (FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local self-attention over their own token representations while periodically exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters, highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method, optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Abstract: Kernel discrepancies are a powerful tool for analyzing worst-case errors in quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Building on recent advances in optimizing such discrepancy measures, we extend the subset selection problem to the setting of kernel discrepancies, selecting an m-element subset from a large population of size $n \gg m$. We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to general kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples from both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional setting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known density functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy. We also explore the relationship between the classical $L_2$ star discrepancy and its $L_\infty$ counterpart.

Abstract: We argue that sixth-generation (6G) intelligence is not fluent token prediction but the capacity to imagine and choose -- to simulate future scenarios, weigh trade-offs, and act with calibrated uncertainty. We reframe open radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via counterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an action-conditioned generative state space. This enables quantitative "what-if" forecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling primitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as first-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis. An agentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM) planner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within data-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic latent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories and predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic O-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with 32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster inference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.

Abstract: Classical probabilistic graphical models face fundamental challenges in modern data environments, which are characterized by high dimensionality, source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints. In this work, we revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field (MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and multi-institutional integration.

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet, developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However, current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1) multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2) block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .

<title>Accelerated Frank-Wolfe Algorithms: Complementarity Conditions and Sparsity</title>

Abstract: We develop new accelerated first-order algorithms in the Frank-Wolfe (FW) family for minimizing smooth convex functions over compact convex sets, with a focus on two prominent constraint classes: (1) polytopes and (2) matrix domains given by the spectrahedron and the unit nuclear-norm ball. A key technical ingredient is a complementarity condition that captures solution sparsity -- face dimension for polytopes and rank for matrices. We present two algorithms: (1) a purely linear optimization oracle (LOO) method for polytopes that has optimal worst-case first-order (FO) oracle complexity and, aside of a finite \emph{burn-in} phase and up to a logarithmic factor, has LOO complexity that scales with $r/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy and $r$ is the solution sparsity $r$ (independently of the ambient dimension), and (2) a hybrid scheme that combines FW with a sparse projection oracle (e.g., low-rank SVDs for matrix domains with low-rank solutions), which also has optimal FO oracle complexity, and after a finite burn-in phase, only requires $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ sparse projections and LOO calls (independently of both the ambient dimension and the rank of optimal solutions). Our results close a gap on how to accelerate recent advancements in linearly-converging FW algorithms for strongly convex optimization, without paying the price of the dimension.

Abstract: Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models to vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid robotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid teleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive motion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid teleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control while advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining real-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around $250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We demonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can collect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate. Building on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy framework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric vision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous manipulation and dynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible and open-sourced at https://yanjieze.com/TWIST2 . Our collected dataset is also open-sourced at https://twist-data.github.io .

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

Abstract: The number of graph neural network (GNN) architectures has increased rapidly due to the growing adoption of graph analysis. Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task to design/select optimal GNN architectures in diverse graphs. To reduce human efforts, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, existing Graph NAS methods lack explainability to understand the reasons why the model architecture is selected because they use complex search space and neural models to select architecture. Therefore, we propose an explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm with Monte-Carlo tree that makes the decision process explainable. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate ExGNAS compared with four state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods in twelve graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS achieves high average accuracy and efficiency; improving accuracy up to 26.1% and reducing run time up to 88%. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of explainability by questionnaire-based user study and architecture analysis.

Abstract: Recently, optimization on the Riemannian manifold have provided valuable insights to the optimization community. In this regard, extending these methods to to the Wasserstein space is of particular interest, since optimization on Wasserstein space is closely connected to practical sampling processes. Generally, the standard (continuous) optimization method on Wasserstein space is Riemannian gradient flow (i.e., Langevin dynamics when minimizing KL divergence). In this paper, we aim to enrich the family of continuous optimization methods in the Wasserstein space, by extending the gradient flow on it into the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) flow and stochastic variance reduction gradient (SVRG) flow.
  By leveraging the property of Wasserstein space, we construct stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to approximate the corresponding discrete Euclidean dynamics of the desired Riemannian stochastic methods. Then, we obtain the flows in Wasserstein space by Fokker-Planck equation. Finally, we establish convergence rates of the proposed stochastic flows, which align with those known in the Euclidean setting.

Abstract: We argue that the negative transfer problem occurring when the new task to learn arrives is an important problem that needs not be overlooked when developing effective Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) algorithms. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that such issue frequently exists in CRL and cannot be effectively addressed by several recent work on either mitigating plasticity loss of RL agents or enhancing the positive transfer in CRL scenario. To that end, we develop Reset & Distill (R&amp;D), a simple yet highly effective baseline method, to overcome the negative transfer problem in CRL. R&amp;D combines a strategy of resetting the agent's online actor and critic networks to learn a new task and an offline learning step for distilling the knowledge from the online actor and previous expert's action probabilities. We carried out extensive experiments on long sequence of Meta World tasks and show that our simple baseline method consistently outperforms recent approaches, achieving significantly higher success rates across a range of tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of considering negative transfer in CRL and emphasize the need for robust strategies like R&amp;D to mitigate its detrimental effects.

<title>Energy-Based Model for Accurate Estimation of Shapley Values in Feature Attribution</title>

Abstract: Shapley value is a widely used tool in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), as it provides a principled way to attribute contributions of input features to model outputs. However, estimation of Shapley value requires capturing conditional dependencies among all feature combinations, which poses significant challenges in complex data environments. In this article, EmSHAP (Energy-based model for Shapley value estimation), an accurate Shapley value estimation method, is proposed to estimate the expectation of Shapley contribution function under the arbitrary subset of features given the rest. By utilizing the ability of energy-based model (EBM) to model complex distributions, EmSHAP provides an effective solution for estimating the required conditional probabilities. To further improve estimation accuracy, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)-coupled partition function estimation method is introduced. The GRU network captures long-term dependencies with a lightweight parameterization and maps input features into a latent space to mitigate the influence of feature ordering. Additionally, a dynamic masking mechanism is incorporated to further enhance the robustness and accuracy by progressively increasing the masking rate. Theoretical analysis on the error bound as well as application to four case studies verified the higher accuracy and better scalability of EmSHAP in contrast to competitive methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can suffer from hallucinations when generating text. These hallucinations impede various applications in society and industry by making LLMs untrustworthy. Current LLMs generate text in an autoregressive fashion by predicting and appending text tokens. When an LLM is uncertain about the semantic meaning of the next tokens to generate, it is likely to start hallucinating. Thus, it has been suggested that predictive uncertainty is one of the main causes of hallucinations. We introduce Semantically Diverse Language Generation (SDLG) to quantify predictive uncertainty in LLMs. SDLG steers the LLM to generate semantically diverse yet likely alternatives for an initially generated text. This approach provides a precise measure of aleatoric semantic uncertainty, detecting whether the initial text is likely to be hallucinated. Experiments on question-answering tasks demonstrate that SDLG consistently outperforms existing methods while being the most computationally efficient, setting a new standard for uncertainty estimation in LLMs.

Abstract: We present a large-scale dataset called RASPNet for radar adaptive signal processing (RASP) applications to support the development of data-driven models within the adaptive radar community. RASPNet exceeds 16 TB in size and comprises 100 realistic scenarios compiled over a variety of topographies and land types across the contiguous United States. For each scenario, RASPNet comprises 10,000 clutter realizations from an airborne radar setting, which can be used to benchmark radar and complex-valued learning algorithms. RASPNet intends to fill a prominent gap in the availability of a large-scale, realistic dataset that standardizes the evaluation of RASP techniques and complex-valued neural networks. We outline its construction, organization, and several applications, including a transfer learning example to demonstrate how RASPNet can be used for real-world adaptive radar scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we uniquely study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (NN) for classification tasks against that of optimal classifiers. We look at the smallest magnitude of possible additive perturbations that can change a classifier's output. We provide a matrix-theoretic explanation of the adversarial fragility of deep neural networks for classification. In particular, our theoretical results show that a neural network's adversarial robustness can degrade as the input dimension $d$ increases. Analytically, we show that neural networks' adversarial robustness can be only $1/\sqrt{d}$ of the best possible adversarial robustness of optimal classifiers. Our theories match remarkably well with numerical experiments of practically trained NN, including NN for ImageNet images. The matrix-theoretic explanation is consistent with an earlier information-theoretic feature-compression-based explanation for the adversarial fragility of neural networks.

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) operate on graphs by exchanging information between neigbouring nodes. MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.

Abstract: Traditional anomalous traffic detection methods are based on single-view analysis, which has obvious limitations in dealing with complex attacks and encrypted communications. In this regard, we propose a Multi-view Feature Fusion (MuFF) method for network anomaly traffic detection. MuFF models the temporal and interactive relationships of packets in network traffic based on the temporal and interactive viewpoints respectively. It learns temporal and interactive features. These features are then fused from different perspectives for anomaly traffic detection. Extensive experiments on six real traffic datasets show that MuFF has excellent performance in network anomalous traffic detection, which makes up for the shortcomings of detection under a single perspective.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular diversity at single cell level. It provides a global view of cell-type specification during the onset of biological mechanisms such as developmental processes and human organogenesis. Various statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for cell-type classification. Most of the methods utilizes unsupervised lower dimensional projections obtained from for a large reference data. In this work, we proposed a reference-based method for cell type classification, called EnProCell. The EnProCell, first, computes lower dimensional projections that capture both the high variance and class separability through an ensemble of principle component analysis and multiple discriminant analysis. In the second phase, EnProCell trains a deep neural network on the lower dimensional representation of data to classify cell types. The proposed method outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods when tested on four different data sets produced from different single-cell sequencing technologies. The EnProCell showed higher accuracy (98.91) and F1 score (98.64) than other methods for predicting reference from reference datasets. Similarly, EnProCell also showed better performance than existing methods in predicting cell types for data with unknown cell types (query) from reference datasets (accuracy:99.52; F1 score: 99.07). In addition to improved performance, the proposed methodology is simple and does not require more computational resources and time. the EnProCell is available at https://github.com/umar1196/EnProCell.

Abstract: In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint, assuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world scenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference speeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these imperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly incorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a robust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and employ a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using both the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC constraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel consumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly encountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC) applications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.

Abstract: Bike-sharing is an environmentally friendly shared mobility mode, but its self-loop phenomenon, where bikes are returned to the same station after several time usage, significantly impacts equity in accessing its services. Therefore, this study conducts a multiscale analysis with a spatial autoregressive model and double machine learning framework to assess socioeconomic features and geospatial location's impact on the self-loop phenomenon at metro stations and street scales. The results reveal that bike-sharing self-loop intensity exhibits significant spatial lag effect at street scale and is positively associated with residential land use. Marginal treatment effects of residential land use is higher on streets with middle-aged residents, high fixed employment, and low car ownership. The multimodal public transit condition reveals significant positive marginal treatment effects at both scales. To enhance bike-sharing cooperation, we advocate augmenting bicycle availability in areas with high metro usage and low bus coverage, alongside implementing adaptable redistribution strategies.

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on heterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating practical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a benchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose the CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance metrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS Utilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems across diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for enabling edge learning with distributed data while ensuring data privacy. However, the traditional FL with deep neural networks trained via backpropagation can hardly meet the low-latency learning requirements in the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. This challenge mainly arises from the high-dimensional model parameters to be transmitted and the numerous rounds of communication required for convergence due to the inherent randomness of the training process. To address this issue, we adopt the state-of-the-art principle of maximal coding rate reduction to learn linear discriminative features and extend the resultant white-box neural network into FL, yielding the novel framework of Low-Latency Federated Learning (LoLaFL) via forward-only propagation. LoLaFL enables layer-wise transmissions and aggregation with significantly fewer communication rounds, thereby considerably reducing latency. Additionally, we propose two \emph{nonlinear} aggregation schemes for LoLaFL. The first scheme is based on the proof that the optimal NN parameter aggregation in LoLaFL should be harmonic-mean-like. The second scheme further exploits the low-rank structures of the features and transmits the low-rank-approximated covariance matrices of features to achieve additional latency reduction. Theoretic analysis and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of LoLaFL. In comparison with traditional FL, the two nonlinear aggregation schemes for LoLaFL can achieve reductions in latency of over 87\% and 97\%, respectively, while maintaining comparable accuracies.

Abstract: Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) provides an effective way to overcome the challenges of designing reward and the high costs of online interaction. However, since labeling preference needs real-time human feedback, acquiring sufficient preference labels is challenging. To solve this, this paper proposes a offLine prEference-bAsed RL with high Sample Efficiency (LEASE) algorithm, where a learned transition model is leveraged to generate unlabeled preference data. Considering the pretrained reward model may generate incorrect labels for unlabeled data, we design an uncertainty-aware mechanism to ensure the performance of reward model, where only high confidence and low variance data are selected. Moreover, we provide the generalization bound of reward model to analyze the factors influencing reward accuracy, and demonstrate that the policy learned by LEASE has theoretical improvement guarantee. The developed theory is based on state-action pair, which can be easily combined with other offline algorithms. The experimental results show that LEASE can achieve comparable performance to baseline under fewer preference data without online interaction.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving framework for recommendation systems by enabling local data processing; however, data localization introduces substantial obstacles. Traditional federated recommendation approaches treat each user as an isolated entity, failing to construct global user relationship graphs that capture collaborative signals, which limits the accuracy of recommendations. To address this limitation, we derive insight from the insight that semantic similarity reflects preference. similarity, which can be used to improve the construction of user relationship graphs. This paper proposes UFGraphFR, a novel framework with three key components: 1) On the client side, private structured data is first transformed into text descriptions. These descriptions are then encoded into semantic vectors using pre-trained models; 2) On the server side, user relationship graphs are securely reconstructed using aggregated model weights without accessing raw data, followed by information propagation through lightweight graph neural networks; 3) On the client side, user behavior sequences are personalized using Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that UFGraphFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation accuracy and personalization. The framework also maintains robustness across different pre-trained models, as evidenced by the consistent performance metrics obtained. This work provides a practical method for efficient federated recommendations with strict privacy by using semantic vectors, secure user relationship graphs, and personalized behavior sequences.

Abstract: Gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) aims to discover how genes causally regulate each other from gene expression data. It is well-known that statistical dependencies in observed data do not necessarily imply causation, as spurious dependencies may arise from latent confounders, such as non-coding RNAs. Numerous GRNI methods have thus been proposed to address this confounding issue. However, dependencies may also result from selection--only cells satisfying certain survival or inclusion criteria are observed--while these selection-induced spurious dependencies are frequently overlooked in gene expression data analyses. In this work, we show that such selection is ubiquitous and, when ignored or conflated with true regulations, can lead to flawed causal interpretation and misguided intervention recommendations. To address this challenge, a fundamental question arises: can we distinguish dependencies due to regulation, confounding, and crucially, selection? We show that gene perturbations offer a simple yet effective answer: selection-induced dependencies are symmetric under perturbation, while those from regulation or confounding are not. Building on this motivation, we propose GISL (Gene regulatory network Inference in the presence of Selection bias and Latent confounders), a principled algorithm that leverages perturbation data to uncover both true gene regulatory relations and non-regulatory mechanisms of selection and confounding up to the equivalence class. Experiments on synthetic and real-world gene expression data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Optimizing conversions is crucial in modern online advertising systems, enabling advertisers to deliver relevant products to users and drive business outcomes. However, accurately predicting conversion events remains challenging due to variable time delays between user interactions (e.g., impressions or clicks) and the actual conversions. These delays vary substantially across advertisers and products, necessitating flexible optimization windows tailored to specific conversion behaviors. To address this, we propose a novel \textit{Personalized Interpolation} method that extends existing models based on fixed conversion windows to support flexible advertiser-specific optimization windows. Our method enables accurate conversion estimation across diverse delay distributions without increasing system complexity. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments using a real-world ads conversion model. Our results show that this method achieves both high prediction accuracy and improved efficiency compared to existing solutions. This study demonstrates the potential of our Personalized Interpolation method to improve conversion optimization and support a wider range of advertising strategies in large-scale online advertising systems.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to Transformers for sequence modeling tasks. This paper presents a theoretical generalization analysis of selective SSMs, the core architectural component behind the Mamba model. We derive a novel covering number-based generalization bound for selective SSMs, building upon recent theoretical advances in the analysis of Transformer models. Using this result, we analyze how the spectral abscissa of the continuous-time state matrix influences the model's stability during training and its ability to generalize across sequence lengths. We empirically validate our findings on a synthetic majority task, the IMDb sentiment classification benchmark, and the ListOps task, demonstrating how our theoretical insights translate into practical model behavior.

Abstract: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.

Abstract: Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models.
  In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.

Abstract: We study the problem of preconditioning in sequential prediction. From the theoretical lens of linear dynamical systems, we show that convolving the target sequence corresponds to applying a polynomial to the hidden transition matrix. Building on this insight, we propose a universal preconditioning method that convolves the target with coefficients from orthogonal polynomials such as Chebyshev or Legendre. We prove that this approach reduces regret for two distinct prediction algorithms and yields the first ever sublinear and hidden-dimension-independent regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) that hold for systems with marginally table and asymmetric transition matrices. Finally, extensive synthetic and real-world experiments show that this simple preconditioning strategy improves the performance of a diverse range of algorithms, including recurrent neural networks, and generalizes to signals beyond linear dynamical systems.

Abstract: The ''right to be forgotten'' and the data privacy laws that encode it have motivated machine unlearning since its earliest days. Now, some argue that an inbound wave of artificial intelligence regulations -- like the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) -- may offer important new use cases for machine unlearning. However, this position paper argues, this opportunity will only be realized if researchers proactively bridge the (sometimes sizable) gaps between machine unlearning's state of the art and its potential applications to AI regulation. To demonstrate this point, we use the AIA as our primary case study. Specifically, we deliver a ``state of the union'' as regards machine unlearning's current potential (or, in many cases, lack thereof) for aiding compliance with various provisions of the AIA. This starts with a precise cataloging of the potential applications of machine unlearning to AIA compliance. For each, we flag the technical gaps that exist between the potential application and the state of the art of machine unlearning. Finally, we end with a call to action: for machine learning researchers to solve the open technical questions that could unlock machine unlearning's potential to assist compliance with the AIA -- and other AI regulations like it.

Abstract: Part of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when a token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, a method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in a principled way and that is derived from a discrete diffusion model with a custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with a form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion. We provide the code along with a blog post on the project page: https://remdm.github.io

Abstract: Continuous control of non-stationary environments is a major challenge for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The time-dependency of the state transition dynamics aggravates the notorious stability problems of model-free deep actor-critic architectures. We posit that two properties will play a key role in overcoming non-stationarity in transition dynamics: (i)~preserving the plasticity of the critic network and (ii) directed exploration for rapid adaptation to changing dynamics. We show that performing on-policy reinforcement learning with an evidential critic provides both. The evidential design ensures a fast and accurate approximation of the uncertainty around the state value, which maintains the plasticity of the critic network by detecting the distributional shifts caused by changes in dynamics. The probabilistic critic also makes the actor training objective a random variable, enabling the use of directed exploration approaches as a by-product. We name the resulting algorithm \emph{Evidential Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO)} due to the integral role of evidential uncertainty quantification in both policy evaluation and policy improvement stages. Through experiments on non-stationary continuous control tasks, where the environment dynamics change at regular intervals, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art on-policy reinforcement learning variants in both task-specific and overall return.

Abstract: Practitioners designing reinforcement learning policies face a fundamental challenge: translating intended behavioral objectives into representative reward functions. This challenge stems from behavioral intent requiring simultaneous achievement of multiple competing objectives, typically addressed through labor-intensive linear reward composition that yields brittle results. Consider the ubiquitous robotics scenario where performance maximization directly conflicts with energy conservation. Such competitive dynamics are resistant to simple linear reward combinations. In this paper, we present the concept of objective fulfillment upon which we build Fulfillment Priority Logic (FPL). FPL allows practitioners to define logical formula representing their intentions and priorities within multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our novel Balanced Policy Gradient algorithm leverages FPL specifications to achieve up to 500\% better sample efficiency compared to Soft Actor Critic. Notably, this work constitutes the first implementation of non-linear utility scalarization design, specifically for continuous control problems.

Abstract: Generating temporal data under conditions is crucial for forecasting, imputation, and generative tasks. Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

Abstract: The pursuit of energy-efficient and adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) has positioned neuromorphic computing as a promising alternative to conventional computing. However, achieving learning on these platforms requires techniques that prioritize local information while enabling effective credit assignment. Here, we propose noise-based reward-modulated learning (NRL), a novel synaptic plasticity rule that mathematically unifies reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization with biologically-inspired local updates. NRL addresses the computational bottleneck of exact gradients by approximating them through stochastic neural activity, transforming the inherent noise of biological and neuromorphic substrates into a functional resource. Drawing inspiration from biological learning, our method uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and eligibility traces to facilitate retrospective credit assignment. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks, featuring immediate and delayed rewards, shows that NRL achieves performance comparable to baselines optimized using backpropagation, although with slower convergence, while showing significantly superior performance and scalability in multi-layer networks compared to reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL), the most prominent similar approach. While tested on simple architectures, the results highlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power adaptive systems, particularly in computing substrates with locality constraints. NRL offers a theoretically grounded paradigm well-suited for the event-driven characteristics of next-generation neuromorphic AI.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Abstract: We study the complexity of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for learning a two-layer neural network with $P$ neurons on isotropic Gaussian data: $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{p=1}^P a_p\cdot \sigma(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{v}_p^*\rangle)$, $\boldsymbol{x} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where the activation $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an even function with information exponent $k_*>2$ (defined as the lowest degree in the Hermite expansion), $\{\boldsymbol{v}^*_p\}_{p\in[P]}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions, and the non-negative second-layer coefficients satisfy $\sum_{p} a_p^2=1$. We focus on the challenging ``extensive-width'' regime $P\gg 1$ and permit diverging condition number in the second-layer, covering as a special case the power-law scaling $a_p\asymp p^{-\beta}$ where $\beta\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. We provide a precise analysis of SGD dynamics for the training of a student two-layer network to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) objective, and explicitly identify sharp transition times to recover each signal direction. In the power-law setting, we characterize scaling law exponents for the MSE loss with respect to the number of training samples and SGD steps, as well as the number of parameters in the student neural network. Our analysis entails that while the learning of individual teacher neurons exhibits abrupt transitions, the juxtaposition of $P\gg 1$ emergent learning curves at different timescales leads to a smooth scaling law in the cumulative objective.

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: Quantitative assessment of treatment response in Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) with bone metastases remains an unmet clinical need. Whole-Body Diffusion-Weighted MRI (WB-DWI) provides two response biomarkers: Total Diffusion Volume (TDV) and global Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (gADC). However, tracking post-treatment changes of TDV and gADC from manually delineated lesions is cumbersome and increases inter-reader variability. We developed a software to automate this process. Core technologies include: (i) a weakly-supervised Residual U-Net model generating a skeleton probability map to isolate bone; (ii) a statistical framework for WB-DWI intensity normalisation, obtaining a signal-normalised b=900s/mm^2 (b900) image; and (iii) a shallow convolutional neural network that processes outputs from (i) and (ii) to generate a mask of suspected bone lesions, characterised by higher b900 signal intensity due to restricted water diffusion. This mask is applied to the gADC map to extract TDV and gADC statistics. We tested the tool using expert-defined metastatic bone disease delineations on 66 datasets, assessed repeatability of imaging biomarkers (N=10), and compared software-based response assessment with a construct reference standard (N=118). Average dice score between manual and automated delineations was 0.6 for lesions within pelvis and spine, with an average surface distance of 2mm. Relative differences for log-transformed TDV (log-TDV) and median gADC were 8.8% and 5%, respectively. Repeatability analysis showed coefficients of variation of 4.6% for log-TDV and 3.5% for median gADC, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 or higher. The software achieved 80.5% accuracy, 84.3% sensitivity, and 85.7% specificity in assessing response to treatment. Average computation time was 90s per scan.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) offers a practical learning paradigm in which goal-reaching policies are trained from abundant state-action trajectory datasets without additional environment interaction. However, offline GCRL still struggles with long-horizon tasks, even with recent advances that employ hierarchical policy structures, such as HIQL. Identifying the root cause of this challenge, we observe the following insight. Firstly, performance bottlenecks mainly stem from the high-level policy's inability to generate appropriate subgoals. Secondly, when learning the high-level policy in the long-horizon regime, the sign of the advantage estimate frequently becomes incorrect. Thus, we argue that improving the value function to produce a clear advantage estimate for learning the high-level policy is essential. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution: Option-aware Temporally Abstracted value learning, dubbed OTA, which incorporates temporal abstraction into the temporal-difference learning process. By modifying the value update to be option-aware, our approach contracts the effective horizon length, enabling better advantage estimates even in long-horizon regimes. We experimentally show that the high-level policy learned using the OTA value function achieves strong performance on complex tasks from OGBench, a recently proposed offline GCRL benchmark, including maze navigation and visual robotic manipulation environments.

Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding principles to integrate top-down information continually and without supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as 1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

<title>Why and When Deep is Better than Shallow: An Implementation-Agnostic State-Transition View of Depth Supremacy</title>

Abstract: Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast>1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score-matching models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space, to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization. DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass, without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

<title>DreamPRM: Domain-Reweighted Process Reward Model for Multimodal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: In strategic classification, the standard supervised learning setting is extended to support the notion of strategic user behavior in the form of costly feature manipulations made in response to a classifier. While standard learning supports a broad range of model classes, the study of strategic classification has, so far, been dedicated mostly to linear classifiers. This work aims to expand the horizon by exploring how strategic behavior manifests under non-linear classifiers and what this implies for learning. We take a bottom-up approach showing how non-linearity affects decision boundary points, classifier expressivity, and model class complexity. Our results show how, unlike the linear case, strategic behavior may either increase or decrease effective class complexity, and that the complexity decrease may be arbitrarily large. Another key finding is that universal approximators (e.g., neural nets) are no longer universal once the environment is strategic. We demonstrate empirically how this can create performance gaps even on an unrestricted model class.

Abstract: Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help identify said features and gain further insights into neural network representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest. Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating in dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models, achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse, interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated features. To move beyond this, we compare them with an iterative SAE that unrolls Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction as more atoms are selected.

<title>Neural Collapse in Cumulative Link Models for Ordinal Regression: An Analysis with Unconstrained Feature Model</title>

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks, in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR, highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

Abstract: We present ProbHardE2E, a probabilistic forecasting framework that incorporates hard operational/physical constraints, and provides uncertainty quantification. Our methodology uses a novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined with a wide range of neural network architectures. DPPL allows the model to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at inference. ProbHardE2E optimizes a strictly proper scoring rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E in learning partial differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general framework that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

<title>ABS: Enforcing Constraint Satisfaction On Generated Sequences Via Automata-Guided Beam Search</title>

Abstract: Sequence generation and prediction form a cornerstone of modern machine learning, with applications spanning natural language processing, program synthesis, and time-series forecasting. These tasks are typically modeled in an autoregressive fashion, where each token is generated conditional on the preceding ones, and beam search is commonly used to balance exploration and fluency during decoding. While deep learning models and Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing statistical patterns in this setting, they remain ill-equipped to guarantee compliance with formal constraints. In this paper, we introduce ABS: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with any constraint that can be compiled into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), without requiring retraining. ABS leverages the DFA to guide a constrained variant of beam search: at each decoding step, transitions leading to violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked according to both the model's probabilities and the automaton's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that ABS also improves output quality. We validate our approach on three distinct tasks: constrained image-stream classification, controlled text generation, and text infilling. In all settings, ABS achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while outperforming or matching state-of-the-art baselines on standard quality metrics and efficiency.

Abstract: As AI becomes more personal, e.g., Agentic AI, there is an increasing need for personalizing models for various use cases. Personalized federated learning (PFL) enables each client to collaboratively leverage other clients' knowledge for better adaptation to the task of interest, without privacy risks. Despite its potential, existing PFL methods remain confined to rather simplified scenarios where data and models are the same across clients. To move towards realistic scenarios, we propose FedMosaic, a method that jointly addresses data and model heterogeneity with a task-relevance-aware model aggregation strategy to reduce parameter interference, and a dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous architectures without huge computational cost. To mimic the real-world task diversity, we propose a multi-modal PFL benchmark spanning 40 distinct tasks with distribution shifts over time. The empirical study shows that FedMosaic outperforms the state-of-the-art PFL methods, excelling in both personalization and generalization capabilities under challenging, realistic scenarios.

Abstract: We study a two-player zero-sum game in which the row player aims to maximize their payoff against an adversarial column player, under an unknown payoff matrix estimated through bandit feedback. We propose three algorithms based on the Explore-Then-Commit framework. The first adapts it to zero-sum games, the second incorporates adaptive elimination that leverages the $\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium property to efficiently select the optimal action pair, and the third extends the elimination algorithm by employing non-uniform exploration. Our objective is to demonstrate the applicability of ETC in a zero-sum game setting by focusing on learning pure strategy Nash Equilibria. A key contribution of our work is a derivation of instance-dependent upper bounds on the expected regret of our proposed algorithms, which has received limited attention in the literature on zero-sum games. Particularly, after $T$ rounds, we achieve an instance-dependent regret upper bounds of $O(\Delta + \sqrt{T})$ for ETC in zero-sum game setting and $O(\log (T \Delta^2) / \Delta)$ for the adaptive elimination algorithm and its variant with non-uniform exploration, where $\Delta$ denotes the suboptimality gap. Therefore, our results indicate that ETC-based algorithms perform effectively in adversarial game settings, achieving regret bounds comparable to existing methods while providing insight through instance-dependent analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models trained on equilibrium molecular distributions have proven effective for sampling biomolecules. Beyond direct sampling, the score of such a model can also be used to derive the forces that act on molecular systems. However, while classical diffusion sampling usually recovers the training distribution, the corresponding energy-based interpretation of the learned score is often inconsistent with this distribution, even for low-dimensional toy systems. We trace this inconsistency to inaccuracies of the learned score at very small diffusion timesteps, where the model must capture the correct evolution of the data distribution. In this regime, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker--Planck equation, which governs the evolution of the score. We interpret this deviation as one source of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker--Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency. We demonstrate our approach by sampling and simulating multiple biomolecular systems, including fast-folding proteins, and by introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and achieves improved consistency and efficient sampling. Our code, model weights, and self-contained JAX and PyTorch notebooks are available at https://github.com/noegroup/ScoreMD.

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured. These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
  In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical. A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical structures. We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose activation depends on contextual conditions.
  To capture these inter-variable hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system architectures.
  Our framework defines hierarchical distances and kernels to enable surrogate modeling and optimization on hierarchical domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on complex system design problems, including a neural network and a green-aircraft case study. Our methods are available in the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0).

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh, validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification, and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets. To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive scaling paradigm, enabled by the principle of emergent semantics in Transformers with frozen, non-semantic input embeddings. We posit that because high-level meaning is a compositional property of a Transformer's deep layers, not its input vectors, the embedding layer and trained lower layers can serve as a fixed foundation. This liberates backpropagation to focus solely on newly added components, making incremental growth viable. We operationalize this with a layer-wise constructive methodology that combines strict layer freezing in early stages with efficient, holistic fine-tuning of the entire model stack via low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as complexity increases. This method not only demonstrates stable convergence but also reveals a direct correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities, such as those required for SQuAD, which are absent in shallower models. In a controlled study, our constructively grown model rivals the performance of a monolithically trained baseline of the same size, validating the efficiency and efficacy of the approach. Our findings suggest a path towards a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a more biological or constructive model of AI development. This opens a path for more resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more modular approach to building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to facilitate further research.

Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than ${1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to ${37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by ${11}\%$ on average.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose intelligent agents is intrinsically linked to the environments in which they are trained. While scaling models and datasets has yielded remarkable capabilities, scaling the complexity, diversity, and interactivity of environments remains a crucial bottleneck. Hand-crafted environments are finite and often contain implicit biases, limiting the potential for agents to develop truly generalizable and robust skills. In this work, we propose a paradigm for generating a boundless and adaptive curriculum of challenges by framing the environment generation process as an adversarial game. We introduce a system where a team of cooperative multi-agent defenders learns to survive against a procedurally generative attacker. The attacker agent learns to produce increasingly challenging configurations of enemy units, dynamically creating novel worlds tailored to exploit the defenders' current weaknesses. Concurrently, the defender team learns cooperative strategies to overcome these generated threats. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling environment where complexity arises organically from the adversarial interaction, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training data. We demonstrate that with minimal training, this approach leads to the emergence of complex, intelligent behaviors, such as flanking and shielding by the attacker, and focus-fire and spreading by the defenders. Our findings suggest that adversarial co-evolution is a powerful mechanism for automatically scaling environmental complexity, driving agents towards greater robustness and strategic depth.

Abstract: We study a compositional variant of kernel ridge regression in which the predictor is applied to a coordinate-wise reweighting of the inputs. Formulated as a variational problem, this model provides a simple testbed for feature learning in compositional architectures. From the perspective of variable selection, we show how relevant variables are recovered while noise variables are eliminated. We establish guarantees showing that both global minimizers and stationary points discard noise coordinates when the noise variables are Gaussian distributed. A central finding is that $\ell_1$-type kernels, such as the Laplace kernel, succeed in recovering features contributing to nonlinear effects at stationary points, whereas Gaussian kernels recover only linear ones.

<title>FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

<title>Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification</title>

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks. The project website is at https://zinanlin.me/blogs/latent_zoning_networks.html.

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements, when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

<title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Precipitation Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for GNSS-based Precipitation Nowcasting</title>

Abstract: Precipitation Nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like precipitation nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for precipitation nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focusing on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at hourly intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 140 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation protocols to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, including multi-scale prediction, multi-resolution forecasting, and extreme rainfall events, benchmarking 17 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is available at: .

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is especially challenging when latent variables or selection bias are present. The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm addresses this setting but often performs exhaustive conditional independence tests across many subsets, leading to spurious independence claims, extra or missing edges, and unreliable orientations. We present a family of score-guided mixed-strategy causal search algorithms that build on this tradition. First, we introduce BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI, straightforward variants of GFCI that substitute BOSS or GRaSP for FGES, thereby retaining correctness while incurring different scalability tradeoffs. Second, we develop FCI Targeted-testing (FCIT), a novel mixed-strategy method that improves upon these variants by replacing exhaustive all-subsets testing with targeted tests guided by BOSS, yielding well-formed PAGs with higher precision and efficiency. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic, LV-Dumb (also known as BOSS-POD), which bypasses latent-variable-specific reasoning and directly returns the PAG of the BOSS DAG. Although not strictly correct in the FCI sense, it scales better and often achieves superior accuracy in practice. Simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI provide sound baselines, FCIT improves both efficiency and reliability, and LV-Dumb offers a practical heuristic with strong empirical performance. Together, these method highlight the value of score-guided and targeted strategies for scalable latent-variable causal discovery.

<title>Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity. By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77% revenue lift with the same computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture in which the recurrent core is realized as a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC in an exponentially large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$, which serves as a coherent recurrent quantum memory. The PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit Pauli expectation-value readouts are combined with the input embedding and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial observation via mid-circuit readouts, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling. For sequence-to-sequence learning, we further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts and show its effectiveness for machine translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise) grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Abstract: Discovering the antecedents of individuals' influence in collaborative environments is an important, practical, and challenging problem. In this paper, we study interpersonal influence in small groups of individuals who collectively execute a sequence of intellective tasks. We observe that along an issue sequence with feedback, individuals with higher expertise and social confidence are accorded higher interpersonal influence. We also observe that low-performing individuals tend to underestimate their high-performing teammate's expertise. Based on these observations, we introduce three hypotheses and present empirical and theoretical support for their validity. We report empirical evidence on longstanding theories of transactive memory systems, social comparison, and confidence heuristics on the origins of social influence. We propose a cognitive dynamical model inspired by these theories to describe the process by which individuals adjust interpersonal influences over time. We demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting individuals' influence and provide analytical results on its asymptotic behavior for the case with identically performing individuals. Lastly, we propose a novel approach using deep neural networks on a pre-trained text embedding model for predicting the influence of individuals. Using message contents, message times, and individual correctness collected during tasks, we are able to accurately predict individuals' self-reported influence over time. Extensive experiments verify the accuracy of the proposed models compared to baselines such as structural balance and reflected appraisal model. While the neural networks model is the most accurate, the dynamical model is the most interpretable for influence prediction.

Abstract: We give a pair of algorithms that efficiently learn a quantum state prepared by Clifford gates and $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates. Specifically, for an $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ prepared with at most $t$ non-Clifford gates, our algorithms use $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$ time and copies of $|\psi\rangle$ to learn $|\psi\rangle$ to trace distance at most $\varepsilon$.
  The first algorithm for this task is more efficient, but requires entangled measurements across two copies of $|\psi\rangle$. The second algorithm uses only single-copy measurements at the cost of polynomial factors in runtime and sample complexity. Our algorithms more generally learn any state with sufficiently large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators. We also develop an efficient property testing algorithm for stabilizer dimension, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We examine the extent to which sublinear-sample property testing and estimation apply to settings where samples are independently but not identically distributed. Specifically, we consider the following distributional property testing framework: Suppose there is a set of distributions over a discrete support of size $k$, $p_1, p_2,\ldots,p_T$, and we obtain $c$ independent draws from each distribution. Suppose the goal is to learn or test a property of the average distribution, $p_{avg}$. This setup models a number of important practical settings where the individual distributions correspond to heterogeneous entities -- either individuals, chronologically distinct time periods, spatially separated data sources, etc. From a learning standpoint, even with $c=1$ samples from each distribution, $\Theta(k/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary and sufficient to learn $p_{avg}$ to within error $\varepsilon$ in $\ell_1$ distance. To test uniformity or identity -- distinguishing the case that $p_{avg}$ is equal to some reference distribution, versus has $\ell_1$ distance at least $\varepsilon$ from the reference distribution, we show that a linear number of samples in $k$ is necessary given $c=1$ samples from each distribution. In contrast, for $c \ge 2$, we recover the usual sublinear sample testing guarantees of the i.i.d.\ setting: we show that $O(\sqrt{k}/\varepsilon^2 + 1/\varepsilon^4)$ total samples are sufficient, matching the optimal sample complexity in the i.i.d.\ case in the regime where $\varepsilon \ge k^{-1/4}$. Additionally, we show that in the $c=2$ case, there is a constant $\rho > 0$ such that even in the linear regime with $\rho k$ samples, no tester that considers the multiset of samples (ignoring which samples were drawn from the same $p_i$) can perform uniformity testing. We also extend our techniques to the problem of testing "closeness" of two distributions.

Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.

Abstract: Tracking the solution of time-varying variational inequalities is an important problem with applications in game theory, optimization, and machine learning. Existing work considers time-varying games or time-varying optimization problems. For strongly convex optimization problems or strongly monotone games, these results provide tracking guarantees under the assumption that the variation of the time-varying problem is restrained, that is, problems with a sublinear solution path. In this work we extend existing results in two ways: In our first result, we provide tracking bounds for (1) variational inequalities with a sublinear solution path but not necessarily monotone functions, and (2) for periodic time-varying variational inequalities that do not necessarily have a sublinear solution path-length. Our second main contribution is an extensive study of the convergence behavior and trajectory of discrete dynamical systems of periodic time-varying VI. We show that these systems can exhibit provably chaotic behavior or can converge to the solution. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with experiments.

<title>Scaffolded Language Models with Language Supervision for Mixed-Autonomy: A Survey</title>

Abstract: This survey organizes the intricate literature on the design and optimization of emerging structures around post-trained LMs. We refer to this overarching structure as scaffolded LMs and focus on LMs that are integrated into multi-step processes with tools. We view scaffolded LMs as semi-parametric models wherein we train non-parametric variables, including the prompt, tools, and scaffold's code. In particular, they interpret instructions, use tools, and receive feedback all in language. Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to interpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to intricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of scaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric training is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in learning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement learning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss functions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and expressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and supporting compatibility with closed-source models. Furthermore, agents are increasingly deployed as co-workers in real-world applications such as Copilot in Office tools or software development. In these mixed-autonomy settings, where control and decision-making are shared between human and AI, users point out errors or suggest corrections. Accordingly, we discuss agents that continuously improve by learning from this real-time, language-based feedback and refer to this setting as streaming learning from language supervision.

<title>Language-Agnostic Modeling of Source Reliability on Wikipedia</title>

Abstract: Over the last few years, verifying the credibility of information sources has become a fundamental need to combat disinformation. Here, we present a language-agnostic model designed to assess the reliability of web domains as sources in references across multiple language editions of Wikipedia. Utilizing editing activity data, the model evaluates domain reliability within different articles of varying controversiality, such as Climate Change, COVID-19, History, Media, and Biology topics. Crafting features that express domain usage across articles, the model effectively predicts domain reliability, achieving an F1 Macro score of approximately 0.80 for English and other high-resource languages. For mid-resource languages, we achieve 0.65, while the performance of low-resource languages varies. In all cases, the time the domain remains present in the articles (which we dub as permanence) is one of the most predictive features. We highlight the challenge of maintaining consistent model performance across languages of varying resource levels and demonstrate that adapting models from higher-resource languages can improve performance. We believe these findings can assist Wikipedia editors in their ongoing efforts to verify citations and may offer useful insights for other user-generated content communities.

<title>Detection Augmented Bandit Procedures for Piecewise Stationary MABs: A Modular Approach</title>

Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being non-stationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such Detection Augmented Bandit (DAB) procedures. To this end, we first provide novel, improved performance lower bounds for PS-MABs. Then, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a DAB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of DAB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that the regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular DAB procedures that are order-optimal. Finally, we showcase the practical effectiveness of our modular DAB approach in our experiments, studying its regret performance compared to other methods and investigating its detection capabilities.

Abstract: Side-channel analysis (SCA) poses a real-world threat by exploiting unintentional physical signals to extract secret information from secure devices. Evaluation labs also use the same techniques to certify device security. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a prominent method for SCA, achieving state-of-the-art attack performance at the cost of interpretability. Understanding how neural networks extract secrets is crucial for security evaluators aiming to defend against such attacks, as only by understanding the attack can one propose better countermeasures.
  In this work, we apply mechanistic interpretability to neural networks trained for SCA, revealing \textit{how} models exploit \textit{what} leakage in side-channel traces. We focus on sudden jumps in performance to reverse engineer learned representations, ultimately recovering secret masks and moving the evaluation process from black-box to white-box. Our results show that mechanistic interpretability can scale to realistic SCA settings, even when relevant inputs are sparse, model accuracies are low, and side-channel protections prevent standard input interventions.

Abstract: Foundational models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning field, leveraging their capacity to learn robust representations from large-scale datasets and effectively to diverse downstream applications such as classification. In this paper, we present Astromer 2 a foundational model specifically designed for extracting light curve embeddings. We introduce Astromer 2 as an enhanced iteration of our self-supervised model for light curve analysis. This paper highlights the advantages of its pre-trained embeddings, compares its performance with that of its predecessor, Astromer 1, and provides a detailed empirical analysis of its capabilities, offering deeper insights into the model's representations. Astromer 2 is pretrained on 1.5 million single-band light curves from the MACHO survey using a self-supervised learning task that predicts randomly masked observations within sequences. Fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset allows us to assess its performance in classification tasks. The quality of the embeddings is measured by the F1 score of an MLP classifier trained on Astromer-generated embeddings. Our results demonstrate that Astromer 2 significantly outperforms Astromer 1 across all evaluated scenarios, including limited datasets of 20, 100, and 500 samples per class. The use of weighted per-sample embeddings, which integrate intermediate representations from Astromer's attention blocks, is particularly impactful. Notably, Astromer 2 achieves a 15% improvement in F1 score on the ATLAS dataset compared to prior models, showcasing robust generalization to new datasets. This enhanced performance, especially with minimal labeled data, underscores the potential of Astromer 2 for more efficient and scalable light curve analysis.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is highly effective for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, but it faces significant computational challenges due to the high computational complexity of Gaussian processes, which results in a total time complexity that is quartic with respect to the number of iterations. To address this limitation, we propose the Bayesian Optimization by Kernel regression and density-based Exploration (BOKE) algorithm. BOKE uses kernel regression for efficient function approximation, kernel density for exploration, and integrates them into the confidence bound criteria to guide the optimization process, thus reducing computational costs to quadratic. Our theoretical analysis rigorously establishes the global convergence of BOKE and ensures its robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, we demonstrate that BOKE not only performs competitively compared to Gaussian process-based methods and several other baseline methods but also exhibits superior computational efficiency. These results highlight BOKE's effectiveness in resource-constrained environments, providing a practical approach for optimization problems in engineering applications.

Abstract: The increasing use of generative ML foundation models for image restoration tasks such as super-resolution calls for robust and interpretable uncertainty quantification methods. We address this need by presenting a novel approach based on conformal prediction techniques to create a 'confidence mask' capable of reliably and intuitively communicating where the generated image can be trusted. Our method is adaptable to any black-box generative model, including those locked behind an opaque API, requires only easily attainable data for calibration, and is highly customizable via the choice of a local image similarity metric. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for our method that span fidelity error control (according to our local image similarity metric), reconstruction quality, and robustness in the face of data leakage. Finally, we empirically evaluate these results and establish our method's solid performance.

Abstract: Molecular discovery has brought great benefits to the chemical industry. Various molecule design techniques are developed to identify molecules with desirable properties. Traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, continue to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple molecular design benchmarks. However, these techniques rely solely on random walk exploration, which hinders both the quality of the final solution and the convergence speed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Gradient Genetic Algorithm (Gradient GA), which incorporates gradient information from the objective function into genetic algorithms. Instead of random exploration, each proposed sample iteratively progresses toward an optimal solution by following the gradient direction. We achieve this by designing a differentiable objective function parameterized by a neural network and utilizing the Discrete Langevin Proposal to enable gradient guidance in discrete molecular spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both convergence speed and solution quality, outperforming cutting-edge techniques. For example, it achieves up to a 25% improvement in the top-10 score over the vanilla genetic algorithm. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/debadyuti23/GradientGA.

Abstract: Palms are ecologically and economically indicators of tropical forest health, biodiversity, and human impact that support local economies and global forest product supply chains. While palm detection in plantations is well-studied, efforts to map naturally occurring palms in dense forests remain limited by overlapping crowns, uneven shading, and heterogeneous landscapes. We develop PRISM (Processing, Inference, Segmentation, and Mapping), a flexible pipeline for detecting and localizing palms in dense tropical forests using large orthomosaic images. Orthomosaics are created from thousands of aerial images and spanning several to hundreds of gigabytes. Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a large UAV-derived orthomosaic dataset collected across 21 ecologically diverse sites in western Ecuador, annotated with 8,830 bounding boxes and 5,026 palm center points. Second, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art object detectors based on efficiency and performance, integrating zero-shot SAM 2 as the segmentation backbone, and refining the results for precise geographic mapping. Third, we apply calibration methods to align confidence scores with IoU and explore saliency maps for feature explainability. Though optimized for palms, PRISM is adaptable for identifying other natural objects, such as eastern white pines. Future work will explore transfer learning for lower-resolution datasets (0.5 to 1m).

Abstract: A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) is a generative model renowned for its ability to produce high-quality outputs in tasks such as image and audio generation. However, training DPMs on large, high-dimensional datasets such as high-resolution images or audio incurs significant computational, energy, and hardware costs. In this work, we introduce efficient quantum algorithms for implementing DPMs through various quantum ODE solvers. These algorithms highlight the potential of quantum Carleman linearization for diverse mathematical structures, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum linear system solvers (QLSS) or linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (LCHS). Specifically, we focus on two approaches: DPM-solver-$k$ which employs exact $k$-th order derivatives to compute a polynomial approximation of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$; and UniPC which uses finite difference of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$ at different points $(x_{s_m}, \lambda_{s_m})$ to approximate higher-order derivatives. As such, this work represents one of the most direct and pragmatic applications of quantum algorithms to large-scale machine learning models, presumably taking substantial steps towards demonstrating the practical utility of quantum computing.

Abstract: In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.

Abstract: The emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in mission- and safety-critical applications brings their reliability to the front. High performance demands of DNNs require the use of specialized hardware accelerators. Systolic array architecture is widely used in DNN accelerators due to its parallelism and regular structure. This work presents a run-time reconfigurable systolic array architecture with three execution modes and four implementation options. All four implementations are evaluated in terms of resource utilization, throughput, and fault tolerance improvement. The proposed architecture is used for reliability enhancement of DNN inference on systolic array through heterogeneous mapping of different network layers to different execution modes. The approach is supported by a novel reliability assessment method based on fault propagation analysis. It is used for the exploration of the appropriate execution mode--layer mapping for DNN inference. The proposed architecture efficiently protects registers and MAC units of systolic array PEs from transient and permanent faults. The reconfigurability feature enables a speedup of up to $3\times$, depending on layer vulnerability. Furthermore, it requires $6\times$ fewer resources compared to static redundancy and $2.5\times$ fewer resources compared to the previously proposed solution for transient faults.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields have emerged as promising tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. Inspired by foundational large language models, recent years have seen considerable progress in developing foundational atomistic models, sometimes referred to as universal force fields, designed to cover most elements in the periodic table. This Perspective adopts a practitioner's viewpoint to ask a critical question: Are these foundational atomistic models reliable for one of their most compelling applications, in particular simulating finite-temperature dynamics? Instead of a broad benchmark, we use the canonical ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in PbTiO$_3$ as a focused case study to evaluate prominent foundational atomistic models. Our findings suggest a potential disconnect between static accuracy and dynamic reliability. While 0 K properties are often well-reproduced, we observed that the models can struggle to consistently capture the correct phase transition, sometimes exhibiting simulation instabilities. We believe these challenges may stem from inherent biases in training data and a limited description of anharmonicity. These observed shortcomings, though demonstrated on a single system, appear to point to broader, systemic challenges that can be addressed with targeted fine-tuning. This Perspective serves not to rank models, but to initiate a crucial discussion on the practical readiness of foundational atomistic models and to explore future directions for their improvement.

<title>Rethinking Bimanual Robotic Manipulation: Learning with Decoupled Interaction Framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.09186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation is an emerging and critical topic in the robotics community. Previous works primarily rely on integrated control models that take the perceptions and states of both arms as inputs to directly predict their actions. However, we think bimanual manipulation involves not only coordinated tasks but also various uncoordinated tasks that do not require explicit cooperation during execution, such as grasping objects with the closest hand, which integrated control frameworks ignore to consider due to their enforced cooperation in the early inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled interaction framework that considers the characteristics of different tasks in bimanual manipulation. The key insight of our framework is to assign an independent model to each arm to enhance the learning of uncoordinated tasks, while introducing a selective interaction module that adaptively learns weights from its own arm to improve the learning of coordinated tasks. Extensive experiments on seven tasks in the RoboTwin dataset demonstrate that: (1) Our framework achieves outstanding performance, with a 23.5% boost over the SOTA method. (2) Our framework is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods. (3) Our framework can be effectively extended to multi-agent manipulation tasks, achieving a 28% boost over the integrated control SOTA. (4) The performance boost stems from the decoupled design itself, surpassing the SOTA by 16.5% in success rate with only 1/6 of the model size.

<title>MIP against Agent: Malicious Image Patches Hijacking Multimodal OS Agents</title>

arXiv:2503.10809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in operating system (OS) agents have enabled vision-language models (VLMs) to directly control a user's computer. Unlike conventional VLMs that passively output text, OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single user prompt. OS agents do so by capturing, parsing, and analysing screenshots and executing low-level actions via application programming interfaces (APIs), such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. This direct interaction with the OS significantly raises the stakes, as failures or manipulations can have immediate and tangible consequences. In this work, we uncover a novel attack vector against these OS agents: Malicious Image Patches (MIPs), adversarially perturbed screen regions that, when captured by an OS agent, induce it to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, a MIP can be embedded in a desktop wallpaper or shared on social media to cause an OS agent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. We show that MIPs generalise across user prompts and screen configurations, and that they can hijack multiple OS agents even during the execution of benign instructions. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents that have to be carefully addressed before their widespread deployment.

Abstract: Coral reefs are declining worldwide due to climate change and local stressors. To inform effective conservation or restoration, monitoring at the highest possible spatial and temporal resolution is necessary. Conventional coral reef surveying methods are limited in scalability due to their reliance on expert labor time, motivating the use of computer vision tools to automate the identification and abundance estimation of live corals from images. However, the design and evaluation of such tools has been impeded by the lack of large high quality datasets. We release the Coralscapes dataset, the first general-purpose dense semantic segmentation dataset for coral reefs, covering 2075 images, 39 benthic classes, and 174k segmentation masks annotated by experts. Coralscapes has a similar scope and the same structure as the widely used Cityscapes dataset for urban scene segmentation, allowing benchmarking of semantic segmentation models in a new challenging domain which requires expert knowledge to annotate. We benchmark a wide range of semantic segmentation models, and find that transfer learning from Coralscapes to existing smaller datasets consistently leads to state-of-the-art performance. Coralscapes will catalyze research on efficient, scalable, and standardized coral reef surveying methods based on computer vision, and holds the potential to streamline the development of underwater ecological robotics.

Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.

Abstract: Although synthetic data has changed various aspects of information retrieval (IR) pipelines, the main training paradigm remains: contrastive learning with binary relevance labels, where one positive document is compared against several negatives using the InfoNCE loss. This objective treats all documents that are not explicitly annotated as relevant on an equally negative footing, regardless of their actual degree of relevance, thus missing subtle nuances useful for ranking. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we forgo real documents and annotations and use large language models to directly generate synthetic documents that answer the MS MARCO queries according to several different levels of relevance. We also propose using Wasserstein distance as a more effective loss function for training transformer-based retrievers with graduated relevance labels. Our experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR benchmark show that our proposed approach outperforms conventional training with InfoNCE by a large margin. Without using any real documents, our method significantly improves self-supervised retrievers and is more robust to distribution shift compared to contrastive learning using real data. Our method also successfully integrates existing real data into the synthetic ranking context, further boosting the performance. Overall, we show that generating multi-level ranking contexts is a better approach to synthetic data generation for IR than just generating the standard positive and negative documents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes degrade into repetitive loops, persistently generating identical word sequences. Because repetition is rare in natural human language, its frequent occurrence across diverse tasks and contexts in LLMs remains puzzling. Here we investigate whether behaviorally similar repetition patterns arise from distinct underlying mechanisms and how these mechanisms develop during model training. We contrast two conditions: repetitions elicited by natural text prompts with those induced by in-context learning (ICL) setups that explicitly require copying behavior. Our analyses reveal that ICL-induced repetition relies on a dedicated network of attention heads that progressively specialize over training, whereas naturally occurring repetition emerges early and lacks a defined circuitry. Attention inspection further shows that natural repetition focuses disproportionately on low-information tokens, suggesting a fallback behavior when relevant context cannot be retrieved. These results indicate that superficially similar repetition behaviors originate from qualitatively different internal processes, reflecting distinct modes of failure and adaptation in language models.

Abstract: The number of studies that combine Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning has been growing steadily in recent years. Evolutionary Machine Learning has been shown to help automate the design of machine learning algorithms and to lead to more reliable solutions. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, has produced good results in learning useful features when labelled data is limited. This suggests that the combination of these two areas can help both in shaping evolutionary processes and in automating the design of deep neural networks, while also reducing the need for labelled data. Still, there are no detailed reviews that explain how Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning can be used together. To help with this, we provide an overview of studies that bring these areas together. Based on this growing interest and the range of existing works, we suggest a new sub-area of research, which we call Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning and introduce a taxonomy for it. Finally, we point out some of the main challenges and suggest directions for future research to help Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning grow and mature as a field.

<title>NMCSE: Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation Method via Optimal Transport for Cardiovascular Disease Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18174</link>

Abstract: The coupling signal refers to a latent physiological signal that characterizes the transformation from cardiac electrical excitation, captured by the electrocardiogram (ECG), to mechanical contraction, recorded by the phonocardiogram (PCG). By encoding the temporal and functional interplay between electrophysiological and hemodynamic events, it serves as an intrinsic link between modalities and offers a unified representation of cardiac function, with strong potential to enhance multi-modal cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection. However, existing coupling signal estimation methods remain highly vulnerable to noise, particularly in real-world clinical and physiological settings, which undermines their robustness and limits practical value. In this study, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates coupling signal estimation as a distribution matching problem solved via optimal transport. By jointly aligning amplitude and timing, NMCSE avoids noise amplification and enables stable signal estimation. When integrated into a Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction (TSFE) network, the estimated coupling signal effectively enhances multi-modal fusion for more accurate CVD detection. To evaluate robustness under real-world conditions, we design two complementary experiments targeting distinct sources of noise. The first uses the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with simulated hospital noise to assess the resilience of NMCSE to clinical interference. The second leverages the EPHNOGRAM dataset with motion-induced physiological noise to evaluate intra-state estimation stability across activity levels. Experimental results show that NMCSE consistently outperforms existing methods under both clinical and physiological noise, highlighting it as a noise-robust estimation approach that enables reliable multi-modal cardiac detection in real-world conditions.

<title>A Unified Framework for Variable Selection in Model-Based Clustering with Missing Not at Random</title>

Abstract: Model-based clustering integrated with variable selection is a powerful tool for uncovering latent structures within complex data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant variables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are missing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While several notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they typically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility and adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address these challenges simultaneously. Our approach incorporates a data-driven penalty matrix into penalized clustering to enable more flexible variable selection, along with a mechanism that explicitly models the relationship between missingness and latent class membership. We demonstrate that, under certain regularity conditions, the proposed framework achieves both asymptotic consistency and selection consistency, even in the presence of missing data. This unified strategy significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of model-based clustering, advancing methodologies for identifying informative variables that define homogeneous subgroups in the presence of complex missing data patterns. The performance of the framework, including its computational efficiency, is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated using both synthetic and real-world transcriptomic datasets.

Abstract: We propose a principled method for autoencoding with random forests. Our strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization, split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings, including tabular, image, and genomic data.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for multimodal learning in Earth science offer limited, siloed coverage of Earth's spheres and their cross-sphere interactions, typically restricting evaluation to the human-activity sphere of atmosphere and to at most 16 tasks. These limitations: \textit{narrow-source heterogeneity (single/few data sources), constrained scientific granularity, and limited-sphere extensibility}. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{OmniEarth-Bench}, the first multimodal benchmark that systematically spans all six spheres: atmosphere, lithosphere, oceanosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and human-activity sphere, and cross-spheres. Built with a scalable, modular-topology data inference framework and native multi-observation sources and expert-in-the-loop curation, OmniEarth-Bench produces 29,855 standardized, expert-curated annotations. All annotations are organized into a four-level hierarchy (Sphere, Scenario, Ability, Task), encompassing 109 expert-curated evaluation tasks. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy, revealing systematic gaps in Earth-system cognitive ability. The dataset and evaluation code were released at OmniEarth-Bench (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OmniEarth-Bench-B1BD).

<title>Unsupervised Evolutionary Cell Type Matching via Entropy-Minimized Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn (MESH) technique to refine the OT plan, transforming diffuse transport matrices into sparse, interpretable correspondences. Through systematic evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that OT-MESH achieves near-optimal matching accuracy with computational efficiency, while maintaining remarkable robustness to noise. Compared to other OT-based methods like RefCM, OT-MESH provides speedup while achieving comparable accuracy. Applied to retinal bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque, OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus, our framework offers a principled, scalable, and interpretable solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into cellular specialization and conservation across species.

Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC) functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer least squares.

<title>DIsoN: Decentralized Isolation Networks for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard the training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping the training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

<title>When Is Diversity Rewarded in Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning?</title>

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2) scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small fragment sets. We propose Recursive Cost Guidance, a backward policy framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an Exploitation Penalty that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a Dynamic Library mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art results in template-based molecular generation.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis shows promise, yet medical imaging datasets are often scarce, imbalanced, and constrained by privacy, making data augmentation essential. Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain, obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create realistic images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose to first cluster the background-only images and then, during learning, create counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. We focus on methods for improving agents' performance on MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from 39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in advancing automated machine learning.

Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.

Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.

<title>Generative World Models of Tasks: LLM-Driven Hierarchical Scaffolding for Embodied Agents</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring successes in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. We propose that an effective world model for decision-making must model the world's physics and also its task semantics. A systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer reveals a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We formalize this trend into a framework for Hierarchical Task Environments (HTEs), which are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. Our framework incorporates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative world models of tasks, capable of dynamically generating this scaffolding. We argue that HTEs provide a mechanism to guide exploration, generate meaningful learning signals, and train agents to internalize hierarchical structure, enabling the development of more capable and general-purpose agents with greater sample efficiency than purely end-to-end approaches.

<title>Realizable Circuit Complexity: Embedding Computation in Space-Time</title>

Abstract: Classical circuit complexity characterizes parallel computation in purely combinatorial terms, ignoring the physical constraints that govern real hardware. The standard classes $\mathbf{NC}$, $\mathbf{AC}$, and $\mathbf{TC}$ treat unlimited fan-in, free interconnection, and polynomial gate counts as feasible -- assumptions that conflict with geometric, energetic, and thermodynamic realities. We introduce the family of \textit{realizable circuit classes} $\mathbf{RC}_d$, which model computation embedded in physical $d$-dimensional space. Each circuit in $\mathbf{RC}_d$ obeys conservative realizability laws: volume scales as $\mathcal{O}(t^d)$, cross-boundary information flux is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(t^{d-1})$ per unit time, and growth occurs through local, physically constructible edits. These bounds apply to all causal systems, classical or quantum. Within this framework, we show that algorithms with runtime $\omega(n^{d/(d-1)})$ cannot scale to inputs of maximal entropy, and that any $d$-dimensional parallel implementation offers at most a polynomial speed-up of degree $(d-1)$ over its optimal sequential counterpart. In the limit $d\to\infty$, $\mathbf{RC}_\infty(\mathrm{polylog})=\mathbf{NC}$, recovering classical parallelism as a non-physical idealization. By unifying geometry, causality, and information flow, $\mathbf{RC}_d$ extends circuit complexity into the physical domain, revealing universal scaling laws for computation.

<title>Variance-Bounded Evaluation of Entity-Centric AI Systems Without Ground Truth: Theory and Measurement</title>

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of AI systems remains a fundamental challenge when ground truth labels are unavailable, particularly for systems generating natural language outputs like AI chat and agent systems. Many of these AI agents and systems focus on entity-centric tasks. In enterprise contexts, organizations deploy AI systems for entity linking, data integration, and information retrieval where verification against gold standards is often infeasible due to proprietary data constraints. Academic deployments face similar challenges when evaluating AI systems on specialized datasets with ambiguous criteria. Conventional evaluation frameworks, rooted in supervised learning paradigms, fail in such scenarios where single correct answers cannot be defined. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation framework for entity-centric AI systems that operates without ground truth by jointly measuring effectiveness and robustness. Given system inputs, VB-Score enumerates plausible interpretations through constraint relaxation and Monte Carlo sampling, assigning probabilities that reflect their likelihood. It then evaluates system outputs by their expected success across interpretations, penalized by variance to assess robustness of the system. We provide formal theoretical analysis establishing key properties including range, monotonicity, and stability along with concentration bounds for Monte Carlo estimation. Through case studies on AI systems with ambiguous inputs, we demonstrate that VB-Score reveals robustness differences hidden by conventional evaluation frameworks, offering a principled measurement framework for assessing AI system reliability in label-scarce domains.

Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.

<title>AWARE, Beyond Sentence Boundaries: A Contextual Transformer Framework for Identifying Cultural Capital in STEM Narratives</title>

Abstract: Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer valuable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in classrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the context of the narrative.

<title>AGNES: Adaptive Graph Neural Network and Dynamic Programming Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Nanopore Seed Chaining</title>

arXiv:2510.16013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.

Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established or young businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. Firstly, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end-to-end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Secondly, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Thirdly, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Lastly, we intend to release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSMEs financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.

arXiv:2510.23241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.

It addresses the need for standardized benchmarks in the rapidly evolving field of deep learning for tabular data. The system includes a curated collection of datasets and models, a public leaderboard, and a team of maintainers. Findings from a large-scale benchmarking study highlight the impact of validation methods and ensembling on model performance. While gradient-boosted trees remain competitive, deep learning methods have shown significant progress, especially with ensembling. Foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Ensembles across models further push the boundaries of tabular machine learning. It is also noted that some deep learning models may be overrepresented in ensembles due to validation set overfitting, urging developers to address this issue.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models, conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard, and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning. We observe that some deep learning models are overrepresented in cross-model ensembles due to validation set overfitting, and we encourage model developers to address this issue. We launch TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information, including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace conditions. The experiments show that the model consistently achieves sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information related to the sources of delay, fulfilling the operational standard for minute-level precision. The framework demonstrates that linguistic understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory data, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows practicality and potential scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

The study examines the Query, Key, Value weight triplet in attention mechanisms of large language models (LLMs). By simplifying assumptions, the researchers demonstrate that Query weights are redundant, leading to a reduction in non-embedding/lm-head parameters by over 8%. This reduction has been validated on GPT-3 small architectures with various complexities, including layer normalization and weight decay, showing comparable validation loss to standard models. The results suggest the potential for reducing redundancy in Query weights at scale, providing insights for more efficient model architectures. <div>

We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay) trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel framework for outlier detection that addresses limitations of conventional projection-based methods. It utilizes a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO) with adaptive loss functions, a global kernel PCA stage for linearizing non-linear data structures, and a local clustering stage for multi-modal distributions. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets show that Two-Stage LKPLO outperforms strong baselines, particularly on challenging structures like multi-cluster data and complex, high-dimensional data. The combination of kernelization and localization stages is crucial for its superior performance. This work offers a valuable tool for outlier detection problems and highlights the effectiveness of hybrid, multi-stage architectures. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO) that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on 10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage architectures.

Summary:
<br />
The article introduces nnLDA, a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism. Unlike traditional models like LDA, nnLDA dynamically captures complex interactions between auxiliary features and topic distributions. A stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm optimizes both neural and probabilistic components, resulting in improved performance in topic coherence, perplexity, and classification tasks compared to LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression. The integration of neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling is particularly beneficial in scenarios with available side information. <div>

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes, or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets, nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

<div> Trust Assessment, Multimodal Large Language Models, Functionally Equivalent Sampling, Uncertainty Quantification, Selective Prediction <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel technique called Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA) to accurately assess the trust of predictions made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). FESTA utilizes task-preserving sampling to expand the input space and evaluate the consistency and sensitivity of the model through equivalent and complementary samples, respectively. This black-box approach does not require ground truth, making it unsupervised. Experimental results with various off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs show that FESTA significantly improves selective prediction performance in visual and audio reasoning tasks. The uncertainty estimate provided by FESTA leads to a 33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and a 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs based on the AUROC metric, enhancing the detection of mispredictions. The code implementation of FESTA is also open-sourced. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel deep BSDE/2BSDE solver that combines truncated log-signatures with a neural rough differential equation (RDE) backbone to address high-dimensional, path-dependent valuation and control problems in finance. The method incorporates a CVaR-tilted terminal objective for targeting left-tail risk and a 2BSDE head for estimating curvature in risk-sensitive control. Results show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in terms of accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option pricing as well as portfolio control tasks. It achieves a lower CVaR(0.99) of 9.80% compared to 12.00-13.10% for baselines, a minimal HJB residual of 0.011, and superior RMSEs for Z and Gamma. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the sequence-to-path representation and the 2BSDE head in improving performance. This work demonstrates the synergy between stochastic analysis and deep learning in advancing financial modeling capabilities. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We tackle high-dimensional, path-dependent valuation and control and introduce a deep BSDE/2BSDE solver that couples truncated log-signatures with a neural rough differential equation (RDE) backbone. The architecture aligns stochastic analysis with sequence-to-path learning: a CVaR-tilted terminal objective targets left-tail risk, while an optional second-order (2BSDE) head supplies curvature estimates for risk-sensitive control. Under matched compute and parameter budgets, the method improves accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option pricing and portfolio control: at d=200 it achieves CVaR(0.99)=9.80% versus 12.00-13.10% for strong baselines, attains the lowest HJB residual (0.011), and yields the lowest RMSEs for Z and Gamma. Ablations over truncation depth, local windows, and tilt parameters confirm complementary gains from the sequence-to-path representation and the 2BSDE head. Taken together, the results highlight a bidirectional dialogue between stochastic analysis and modern deep learning: stochastic tools inform representations and objectives, while sequence-to-path models expand the class of solvable financial models at scale.

Summary: 
This study addresses the problem of recovering a sparse vector $x^\star$ from a linear measurement $y = A x^\star + e$, where $A$ is a known matrix and $e$ is a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. The goal is to find the smallest set containing $x^\star$ that can be recovered from $y$ without knowledge of $e. The study demonstrates that the best achievable recovery set is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is a projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Additionally, it is proven that any $x$ minimizing the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ also lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$. This result provides a constructive method for recovering the defined set without explicit knowledge of $e. The study sheds light on the recoverability limits for arbitrary matrices and sparse vectors in the presence of adversarial noise. <div>

Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $e$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing $x^\star$--hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^\star$--that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has rapidly become a mainstream platform for gaming and interactive experiences, yet ensuring the quality, safety, and appropriateness of VR content remains a pressing challenge. Traditional human-based quality assurance is labor-intensive and cannot scale with the industry's rapid growth. While automated testing has been applied to traditional 2D and 3D games, extending it to VR introduces unique difficulties due to high-dimensional sensory inputs and strict real-time performance requirements. We present VRScout, a deep learning-based agent capable of autonomously navigating VR environments and interacting with virtual objects in a human-like and real-time manner. VRScout learns from human demonstrations using an enhanced Action Chunking Transformer that predicts multi-step action sequences. This enables our agent to capture higher-level strategies and generalize across diverse environments. To balance responsiveness and precision, we introduce a dynamically adjustable sliding horizon that adapts the agent's temporal context at runtime. We evaluate VRScout on commercial VR titles and show that it achieves expert-level performance with only limited training data, while maintaining real-time inference at 60 FPS on consumer-grade hardware. These results position VRScout as a practical and scalable framework for automated VR game testing, with direct applications in both quality assurance and safety auditing.

Summary: <br />
This study presents a novel approach using Sparse Auto Encoders (SAEs) to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in recognizing and not answering unsafe prompts while complying with safe prompts. By efficiently selecting the best steering features through a contrasting prompt method and utilizing the AI-Generated Prompts Dataset, the researchers tested this method on Llama-3 8B. They found that their approach improved safety performance by 18.9% while also increasing utility by 11.1%. This highlights the potential of targeted SAE steering to overcome traditional safety-utility tradeoffs and achieve better performance in LLM deployment. The systematic feature selection methods and principled evaluation used in this study provide a promising avenue for enhancing the safety and utility of LLMs in real-world applications. <div>
arXiv:2511.00029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) deployment requires guiding the LLM to recognize and not answer unsafe prompts while complying with safe prompts. Previous methods for achieving this require adjusting model weights along with other expensive procedures. While recent advances in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have enabled interpretable feature extraction from LLMs, existing approaches lack systematic feature selection methods and principled evaluation of safety-utility tradeoffs. We explored using different steering features and steering strengths using Sparse Auto Encoders (SAEs) to provide a solution. Using an accurate and innovative contrasting prompt method with the AI-Generated Prompts Dataset from teknium/OpenHermes-2p5-Mistral-7B and Air Bench eu-dataset to efficiently choose the best features in the model to steer, we tested this method on Llama-3 8B. We conclude that using this method, our approach achieves an 18.9% improvement in safety performance while simultaneously increasing utility by 11.1%, demonstrating that targeted SAE steering can overcome traditional safety-utility tradeoffs when optimal features are identified through principled selection methods.

Summary:<br />
Machine unlearning has become a popular approach for removing unwanted knowledge without retraining. However, existing techniques may inadvertently lead to "knowledge holes," where benign knowledge is lost. A new test case generation framework is proposed to identify these knowledge gaps. Evaluation shows that unlearned models often fail to provide relevant responses, indicating significant hidden costs of unlearning. This calls for a reevaluation of how knowledge preservation in unlearning is assessed, beyond traditional benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2511.00030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning has emerged as a prevalent technical solution for selectively removing unwanted knowledge absorbed during pre-training, without requiring full retraining. While recent unlearning techniques can effectively remove undesirable content without severely compromising performance on standard benchmarks, we find that they may inadvertently create ``knowledge holes'' -- unintended losses of benign knowledge that standard benchmarks fail to capture. To probe where unlearned models reveal knowledge holes, we propose a test case generation framework that explores both immediate neighbors of unlearned content and broader areas of potential failures. Our evaluation demonstrates significant hidden costs of unlearning: up to 98.7\% of the test cases yield irrelevant or nonsensical responses from unlearned models, despite being answerable by the pretrained model. These findings necessitate rethinking the conventional approach to evaluating knowledge preservation in unlearning, moving beyond standard, static benchmarks.

Summary: 
The article introduces Skip-Block Routing (SBR), a framework designed for enhancing the efficiency of Neural Operators in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for large-scale engineering tasks. SBR integrates into multi-layer architectures of Transformer-based neural operators by utilizing a routing mechanism to learn token complexity and prioritize processing capacity accordingly. By dynamically allocating computational resources based on token complexity, SBR reduces the overall computational cost by approximately 50% in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), while maintaining accuracy. This approach addresses the mismatch between the uniform computational cost of current models and the varying complexities of physical fields, offering up to a 2x faster inference speed. SBR demonstrates its versatility by seamlessly integrating into different neural operators, showcasing its potential in improving computational efficiency for PDE solutions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Neural Operators(NO) have gradually emerged as a popular approach for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, their application to large-scale engineering tasks suffers from significant computational overhead. And the fact that current models impose a uniform computational cost while physical fields exhibit vastly different complexities constitutes a fundamental mismatch, which is the root of this inefficiency. For instance, in turbulence flows, intricate vortex regions require deeper network processing compared to stable flows. To address this, we introduce a framework: Skip-Block Routing (SBR), a general framework designed for Transformer-based neural operators, capable of being integrated into their multi-layer architectures. First, SBR uses a routing mechanism to learn the complexity and ranking of tokens, which is then applied during inference. Then, in later layers, it decides how many tokens are passed forward based on this ranking. This way, the model focuses more processing capacity on the tokens that are more complex. Experiments demonstrate that SBR is a general framework that seamlessly integrates into various neural operators. Our method reduces computational cost by approximately 50% in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), while still delivering up to 2x faster inference without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The dynamic energy sector requires both predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency for short-term forecasting of energy generation under operational constraints, where timely and precise predictions are crucial. The manual configuration of complex methods, which can generate accurate global multi-step predictions without suffering from a computational bottleneck, represents a procedure with significant time requirements and high risk for human-made errors. A further intricacy arises from the temporal dynamics present in energy-related data. Additionally, the generalization to unseen data is imperative for continuously deploying forecasting techniques over time. To overcome these challenges, in this research, we design a neural architecture search (NAS)-based framework for the automated discovery of time series models that strike a balance between computational efficiency, predictive performance, and generalization power for the global, multi-step short-term forecasting of energy production time series. In particular, we introduce a search space consisting only of efficient components, which can capture distinctive patterns of energy time series. Furthermore, we formulate a novel objective function that accounts for performance generalization in temporal context and the maximal exploration of different regions of our high-dimensional search space. The results obtained on energy production time series show that an ensemble of lightweight architectures discovered with NAS outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, such as Transformers, as well as pre-trained forecasting models, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) to address the resource-intensive nature of existing preference optimization methods. It aims to combine a small number of labeled pairwise preferences with a larger pool of unlabeled data to improve efficiency. The key theoretical contribution of the study is the identification of an optimal reward threshold that can separate winning and losing responses with high probability, enabling pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these pseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large unpaired datasets, reducing acquisition costs significantly while maintaining alignment with human preferences. Experimental results across datasets demonstrate the impressive data efficiency of SSPO, with models trained on only 1% of the UltraFeedback dataset consistently outperforming baselines trained on 10% of the same dataset. <div>

Abstract: The field of preference optimization has made outstanding contributions to the alignment of language models with human preferences. Despite these advancements, recent methods still rely heavily on substantial paired (labeled) feedback data, leading to substantial resource expenditures. To address these challenges, we study the problem of Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) in which the idea is to learn from both a small number of pairwise preference labels and a large pool of unpaired samples simultaneously. Our key theoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold capable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which enables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these pseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large-scale unpaired data, thus maintaining human alignment while drastically reducing acquisition costs. Extensive experiments across datasets validate this remarkable data efficiency; for instance, SSPO trained with Llama3-8B-Instruct on just 1% of UltraFeedback consistently surpasses strong baselines trained on 10% of UltraFeedback.

In this study, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) methodology is validated for solving engineering and biological dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Traditional numerical methods may struggle with high stiffness, shocks, irregular domains, and other challenging scenarios. PINNs embed physical laws into the learning process, offering a powerful approach. The study systematically evaluates PINNs on classical ODE problems, highlighting the importance of balancing loss function components and tuning hyperparameters for accurate solutions. Prior knowledge embedding and hard constraints imposition on network architecture enhance predictive capability without losing generality. The study emphasizes the significance of systematic tuning and careful weighting for accurate and efficient predictions using PINNs.

Abstract: In this study, we present and validate the predictive capability of the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) methodology for solving a variety of engineering and biological dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While traditional numerical methods a re effective for many ODEs, they often struggle to achieve convergence in problems involving high stiffness, shocks, irregular domains, singular perturbations, high dimensions, or boundary discontinuities. Alternatively, PINNs offer a powerful approach for handling challenging numerical scenarios. In this study, classical ODE problems are employed as controlled testbeds to systematically evaluate the accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization capability under controlled conditions of the PINNs framework. Although not a universal solution, PINNs can achieve superior results by embedding physical laws directly into the learning process. We first analyze the existence and uniqueness properties of several benchmark problems and subsequently validate the PINNs methodology on these model systems. Our results demonstrate that for complex problems to converge to correct solutions, the loss function components data loss, initial condition loss, and residual loss must be appropriately balanced through careful weighting. We further establish that systematic tuning of hyperparameters, including network depth, layer width, activation functions, learning rate, optimization algorithms, w eight initialization schemes, and collocation point sampling, plays a crucial role in achieving accurate solutions. Additionally, embedding prior knowledge and imposing hard constraints on the network architecture, without loss the generality of the ODE system, significantly enhances the predictive capability of PINNs.

ReLaX-Net is a novel architecture for Physical Neural Networks (PNN) that utilizes a layer-by-layer time-multiplexing approach to enhance the network depth and optimize parameter usage. Through the implementation of fast switches in existing PNN systems, ReLaX-Net demonstrates improved computational performance on image classification and natural language processing tasks. The proposed architecture capitalizes on the time-scale separation between active elements and trainable weights in PNNs, boosting efficiency without requiring significant modifications. Numerical experiments validate ReLaX-Net's efficacy, showing superior performance compared to traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with equivalent parameter counts. This advancement aligns with historical trends seen in digital neural networks, where efficient parameter reuse and architecture optimizations led to significant performance gains. ReLaX-Net represents a promising step towards enhancing PNN scalability and performance in next-generation computing systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Neural Networks (PNN) are promising platforms for next-generation computing systems. However, recent advances in digital neural network performance are largely driven by the rapid growth in the number of trainable parameters and, so far, demonstrated PNNs are lagging behind by several orders of magnitude in terms of scale. This mirrors size and performance constraints found in early digital neural networks. In that period, efficient reuse of parameters contributed to the development of parameter-efficient architectures such as convolutional neural networks.
  In this work, we numerically investigate hardware-friendly weight-tying for PNNs. Crucially, with many PNN systems, there is a time-scale separation between the fast dynamic active elements of the forward pass and the only slowly trainable elements implementing weights and biases. With this in mind,we propose the Reuse of Layers for eXpanding a Neural Network (ReLaX-Net) architecture, which employs a simple layer-by-layer time-multiplexing scheme to increase the effective network depth and efficiently use the number of parameters. We only require the addition of fast switches for existing PNNs. We validate ReLaX-Nets via numerical experiments on image classification and natural language processing tasks. Our results show that ReLaX-Net improves computational performance with only minor modifications to a conventional PNN. We observe a favorable scaling, where ReLaX-Nets exceed the performance of equivalent traditional RNNs or DNNs with the same number of parameters.

Summary: <br />
Financial fraud detection is vital in decentralized environments like cryptocurrency networks. The DynBERG model integrates Graph-BERT with a GRU layer to capture temporal evolution in dynamic financial transaction networks with directed edges. Evaluated on the Elliptic dataset containing Bitcoin transactions, DynBERG outperformed state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification approaches like EvolveGCN and GCN.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is critical for maintaining the integrity of financial systems, particularly in decentralised environments such as cryptocurrency networks. Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as Graph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture, which mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for static graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networks with undirected edges. However, financial transaction networks are inherently dynamic, with evolving structures and directed edges representing the flow of money. To address these challenges, we introduce DynBERG, a novel architecture that integrates Graph-BERT with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture temporal evolution over multiple time steps. Additionally, we modify the underlying algorithm to support directed edges, making DynBERG well-suited for dynamic financial transaction analysis. We evaluate our model on the Elliptic dataset, which includes Bitcoin transactions, including all transactions during a major cryptocurrency market event, the Dark Market Shutdown. By assessing DynBERG's resilience before and after this event, we analyse its ability to adapt to significant market shifts that impact transaction behaviours. Our model is benchmarked against state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification approaches, such as EvolveGCN and GCN, demonstrating superior performance, outperforming EvolveGCN before the market shutdown and surpassing GCN after the event. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the critical role of incorporating a time-series deep learning component, showcasing the effectiveness of GRU in modelling the temporal dynamics of financial transactions.

Extensive experiments on both ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and recent deep learning methods. Quantitative evaluations and visual analyses in Beijing and Shanghai confirm the model's capability to capture fine-grained meteorological patterns. The proposed framework provides a scalable and label-efficient solution for future data-driven weather forecasting systems.

Summary:
The paper introduces FLoRA, a family of fused forward-backward adapters (FFBA) designed for efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. FLoRA combines concepts from low-rank adapters (LoRA) and parallel adapters to enhance fine-tuning accuracy while reducing latency. By integrating the forward and backward adapters into the base model's projection layers, FLoRA achieves superior performance compared to LoRA with similar parameter budgets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FFB adapters in improving accuracy and minimizing latency in fine-tuning LLMs. This innovation addresses the ongoing challenge of efficiently training and fine-tuning increasingly large language models.

Abstract: As the large language models (LLMs) grow in size each day, efficient training and fine-tuning has never been as important as nowadays. This resulted in the great interest in parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and effective methods including low-rank adapters (LoRA) has emerged. Although the various PEFT methods have been studied extensively in the recent years, the greater part of the subject remains unexplored with the huge degree of freedom. In this paper, we propose FLoRA, a family of fused forward-backward adapters (FFBA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs on downstream tasks. The FFBA combine ideas from the popular LoRA and parallel adapters to improve the overall fine-tuning accuracies. At the same time, latencies are minimized by fusing the forward and backward adapters into existing projection layers of the base model. Experimental results show that the proposed FFB adapters perform significantly better than the popularly used LoRA in both accuracy and latency for a similar parameter budget.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods are essential for adapting large pre-trained models, with LoRA considered foundational. The DoRA method, building on LoRA, decomposes weight updates into magnitude and direction, increasing singular value entropy for a more uniform update distribution akin to full fine-tuning. Reformulated into a more efficient matrix form, DoRA emerges as a learnable weight conditioning method. A unified framework explores architectural placement and transformation type of the conditioning matrix, leading to the development of Pre-Diag and SORA methods. Pre-Diag calibrates pre-trained weights efficiently with a diagonal conditioning matrix before the LoRA update, enhancing performance and reducing training time. On the other hand, SORA employs parameter-efficient orthogonal rotation for a norm-preserving transformation of the feature space. Experimental results on natural language tasks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of these proposed methods over LoRA and DoRA.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are crucial for adapting large pre-trained models. Among these, LoRA is considered a foundational approach. Building on this, the influential DoRA method enhances performance by decomposing weight updates into magnitude and direction. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear, and it introduces significant computational overhead. In this work, we first identify that DoRA's success stems from its capacity to increase the singular value entropy of the weight update matrix, which promotes a more uniform update distribution akin to full fine-tuning. We then reformulate DoRA into a mathematically equivalent and more efficient matrix form, revealing it as a learnable weight conditioning method. Based on this insight, we propose a unified framework for designing advanced PEFT methods by exploring two orthogonal dimensions: the architectural placement and the transformation type of the conditioning matrix. Within this framework, we introduce two novel methods: (1) \textbf{Pre-Diag}, which applies a diagonal conditioning matrix before the LoRA update to efficiently calibrate the pre-trained weights, thereby enhancing performance while reducing training time; and (2) \textbf{S}kewed \textbf{O}rthogonal \textbf{R}otation \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{SORA}), which employs a parameter-efficient orthogonal rotation to perform a more powerful, norm-preserving transformation of the feature space. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior performance and efficiency compared to both LoRA and DoRA.

Summary:
Feature-Guided Analysis (FGA) aims to understand neural networks' decision-making processes, crucial for safety-critical applications. By monitoring neuron activations, FGA extracts rules relevant to network tasks. While previous studies show promising results, additional empirical evidence for industrial use is needed. To address this, the paper evaluates FGA on MNIST and LSC benchmark datasets. Results indicate FGA's higher precision compared to existing literature. The study also evaluates the impact of neural network architecture, training, and feature selection on FGA effectiveness. Selection of these components notably affects FGA's recall but has minimal impact on precision.

Abstract: Understanding why neural networks make certain decisions is pivotal for their use in safety-critical applications. Feature-Guided Analysis (FGA) extracts slices of neural networks relevant to their tasks. Existing feature-guided approaches typically monitor the activation of the neural network neurons to extract the relevant rules. Preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrate the feasibility of this solution by assessing the precision and recall of Feature-Guided Analysis on two pilot case studies. However, the applicability in industrial contexts needs additional empirical evidence.
  To mitigate this need, this paper assesses the applicability of FGA on a benchmark made by the MNIST and LSC datasets. We assessed the effectiveness of FGA in computing rules that explain the behavior of the neural network. Our results show that FGA has a higher precision on our benchmark than the results from the literature. We also evaluated how the selection of the neural network architecture, training, and feature selection affect the effectiveness of FGA. Our results show that the selection significantly affects the recall of FGA, while it has a negligible impact on its precision.

Abstract: The design of training objective is central to training time-series forecasting models. Existing training objectives such as mean squared error mostly treat each future step as an independent, equally weighted task, which we found leading to the following two issues: (1) overlook the label autocorrelation effect among future steps, leading to biased training objective; (2) fail to set heterogeneous task weights for different forecasting tasks corresponding to varying future steps, limiting the forecasting performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel quadratic-form weighted training objective, addressing both of the issues simultaneously. Specifically, the off-diagonal elements of the weighting matrix account for the label autocorrelation effect, whereas the non-uniform diagonals are expected to match the most preferable weights of the forecasting tasks with varying future steps. To achieve this, we propose a Quadratic Direct Forecast (QDF) learning algorithm, which trains the forecast model using the adaptively updated quadratic-form weighting matrix. Experiments show that our QDF effectively improves performance of various forecast models, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/QDF-8937.

The automated Verifier ensures the fidelity of reasoning steps, improving trace quality and reducing variance. This dataset of expert traces offers structured, step-by-step examples necessary for fine-tuning and efficient reinforcement learning.

arXiv:2511.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many areas, they struggle with complex spatial reasoning, which requires problem decomposition and strategic tool use. Fine-tuning smaller, more deployable models offers an efficient path to strong performance, but this is hampered by a major bottleneck: the absence of high-quality, step-by-step reasoning data. To address this data-efficiency gap, we introduce SpatialTraceGen, a framework to distill the reasoning processes of a large teacher model into a high-quality dataset of multi-hop, multi-tool reasoning traces. A key innovation is our automated Verifier, which scalably ensures the fidelity of each reasoning step, providing a cost-effective alternative to manual human annotation. On the CLEVR-Humans benchmark, this verifier-guided process improves the average quality score of traces by 17\% while reducing quality variance by over 40\%. SpatialTraceGen delivers a dataset of expert traces, providing the structured, step-by-step examples of tool use necessary for effective fine-tuning and sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning.

Summary:
This paper examines the implementation and effectiveness of Federated Learning (FL) in the context of detecting common thermal features in urban environments using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) thermal images. Real-world data from two German cities is utilized to assess various FL algorithms in comparison to centralized learning. Key metrics such as model accuracy, training time, communication overhead, and energy usage are evaluated to understand the performance of FL in segmentation tasks. The study investigates the challenges posed by non-identical data distributions and feature characteristics across different locations. Different FL workflows, including client-controlled and server-controlled approaches, are explored to determine their impact on performance. By providing insights into practical FL applications in UAV-based imaging tasks, this research contributes valuable knowledge for understanding the capabilities and limitations of FL methods in real-world scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an approach for training a shared Machine Learning (ML) model with distributed training data and multiple participants. FL allows bypassing limitations of the traditional Centralized Machine Learning CL if data cannot be shared or stored centrally due to privacy or technical restrictions -- the participants train the model locally with their training data and do not need to share it among the other participants. This paper investigates the practical implementation and effectiveness of FL in a real-world scenario, specifically focusing on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal images for common thermal feature detection in urban environments. The distributed nature of the data arises naturally and makes it suitable for FL applications, as images captured in two German cities are available. This application presents unique challenges due to non-identical distribution and feature characteristics of data captured at both locations. The study makes several key contributions by evaluating FL algorithms in real deployment scenarios rather than simulation. We compare several FL approaches with a centralized learning baseline across key performance metrics such as model accuracy, training time, communication overhead, and energy usage. This paper also explores various FL workflows, comparing client-controlled workflows and server-controlled workflows. The findings of this work serve as a valuable reference for understanding the practical application and limitations of the FL methods in segmentation tasks in UAV-based imaging.

<div> Memory-efficient optimization algorithms, large language models, layer-wise optimization, module-wise importance sampling, gradient variance reduction<br /><br />Summary:
The article introduces Module-wise Importance SAmpling (MISA) as a novel method for memory-efficient optimization of large language models. Unlike traditional layer-wise optimization, MISA divides each layer into smaller modules and assigns importance scores to optimize them effectively. By using a weighted random sampling mechanism, MISA reduces gradient variance and achieves an \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})\) convergence rate under non-convex and stochastic conditions. The method offers significant memory savings compared to existing baseline methods by activating only essential modules during optimization. Experimental validation across various learning tasks confirms the effectiveness of MISA in enhancing the performance of large language models. A detailed memory analysis highlights the superiority of MISA in terms of memory efficiency. The source code for MISA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2511.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substantial memory demands of pre-training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) require memory-efficient optimization algorithms. One promising approach is layer-wise optimization, which treats each transformer block as a single layer and optimizes it sequentially, while freezing the other layers to save optimizer states and activations. Although effective, these methods ignore the varying importance of the modules within each layer, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, layer-wise sampling provides only limited memory savings, as at least one full layer must remain active during optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Module-wise Importance SAmpling (MISA), a novel method that divides each layer into smaller modules and assigns importance scores to each module. MISA uses a weighted random sampling mechanism to activate modules, provably reducing gradient variance compared to layer-wise sampling. Additionally, we establish an \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})\) convergence rate under non-convex and stochastic conditions, where $K$ is the total number of block updates, and provide a detailed memory analysis showcasing MISA's superiority over existing baseline methods. Experiments on diverse learning tasks validate the effectiveness of MISA. Source code is available at https://github.com/pkumelon/MISA.

Summary:
The article introduces OthelloGPT, a transformer model trained to predict valid moves in Othello, which serves as a testbed for interpretability research. The model's complex nature allows for rich computational patterns, with rule-based game logic enabling meaningful reverse-engineering. An automated approach using decision trees is presented to identify and interpret MLP neurons encoding game logic. Approximately half of the neurons in layer 5 can be accurately described by compact decision trees, while the rest likely engage in more distributed computations. Patterns identified by decision trees are verified to be causally relevant through interventions. Ablating neurons corresponding to specific game patterns significantly impairs the model's predictive ability. A Python tool mapping rule-based behaviors to neurons is provided for researchers to test interpretability methods effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: OthelloGPT, a transformer trained to predict valid moves in Othello, provides an ideal testbed for interpretability research. The model is complex enough to exhibit rich computational patterns, yet grounded in rule-based game logic that enables meaningful reverse-engineering. We present an automated approach based on decision trees to identify and interpret MLP neurons that encode rule-based game logic. Our method trains regression decision trees to map board states to neuron activations, then extracts decision paths where neurons are highly active to convert them into human-readable logical forms. These descriptions reveal highly interpretable patterns; for instance, neurons that specifically detect when diagonal moves become legal. Our findings suggest that roughly half of the neurons in layer 5 can be accurately described by compact, rule-based decision trees ($R^2 > 0.7$ for 913 of 2,048 neurons), while the remainder likely participate in more distributed or non-rule-based computations. We verify the causal relevance of patterns identified by our decision trees through targeted interventions. For a specific square, for specific game patterns, we ablate neurons corresponding to those patterns and find an approximately 5-10 fold stronger degradation in the model's ability to predict legal moves along those patterns compared to control patterns. To facilitate future work, we provide a Python tool that maps rule-based game behaviors to their implementing neurons, serving as a resource for researchers to test whether their interpretability methods recover meaningful computational structures.

Summary:<br />
The EVINGCA algorithm introduces a novel approach to clustering by incorporating density-variance based methods to adaptively construct clusters on a nearest-neighbor graph. Unlike traditional algorithms, EVINGCA does not make restrictive assumptions and instead considers the process of cluster formation as dynamic and evolving. By utilizing local statistical feedback and updating distance and shape statistics, the algorithm creates clusters without relying on fixed density thresholds. EVINGCA features log-linear complexity in the average case and demonstrates competitive performance across diverse datasets, including synthetic, real-world, low-dimensional, and high-dimensional ones. This approach provides a flexible and efficient way to cluster data, offering improved sensitivity and adaptability compared to existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Clustering algorithms often rely on restrictive assumptions: K-Means and Gaussian Mixtures presuppose convex, Gaussian-like clusters, while DBSCAN and HDBSCAN capture non-convexity but can be highly sensitive. I introduce EVINGCA (Evolving Variance-Informed Nonparametric Graph Construction Algorithm), a density-variance based clustering algorithm that treats cluster formation as an adaptive, evolving process on a nearest-neighbor graph. EVINGCA expands rooted graphs via breadth-first search, guided by continuously updated local distance and shape statistics, replacing fixed density thresholds with local statistical feedback. With spatial indexing, EVINGCA features log-linear complexity in the average case and exhibits competitive performance against baselines across a variety of synthetic, real-world, low-d, and high-d datasets.

Summary: 
The study investigates how the brain processes the concept of "house" beyond just auditory input and delves into the layered processing involved in building meaning. By aligning EEG signals with embeddings from pre-trained models wav2vec2 and CLIP, researchers sought to understand which model layers best reflect the brain's processing of language. Through ridge regression and contrastive decoding techniques, the study compared individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation strategies. The results indicate that combining multimodal, layer-aware representations from these models could aid in decoding how the brain comprehends language as a holistic experience rather than just sound. This approach offers insights into the complex neural mechanisms underlying language processing and perception. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we hear the word "house", we don't just process sound, we imagine walls, doors, memories. The brain builds meaning through layers, moving from raw acoustics to rich, multimodal associations. Inspired by this, we build on recent work from Meta that aligned EEG signals with averaged wav2vec2 speech embeddings, and ask a deeper question: which layers of pre-trained models best reflect this layered processing in the brain? We compare embeddings from two models: wav2vec2, which encodes sound into language, and CLIP, which maps words to images. Using EEG recorded during natural speech perception, we evaluate how these embeddings align with brain activity using ridge regression and contrastive decoding. We test three strategies: individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation. The findings suggest that combining multimodal, layer-aware representations may bring us closer to decoding how the brain understands language, not just as sound, but as experience.

Summary:
Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO) is introduced as an extension of GRPO to address the issue of low-probability tokens dominating gradient updates in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). TR-GRPO assigns token-level weights based on the model's predicted probability, reducing the impact of low-probability tokens and amplifying high-probability tokens for more stable and informative training. Experimental results show that TR-GRPO outperforms GRPO across various reasoning tasks in LLMs, such as logic, math, and agentic reasoning. This highlights the significance of regulating token contributions in RL training and positions TR-GRPO as a robust framework for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO) addresses gradient over-amplification in RLVR by assigning token-level weights based on predicted probabilities.

arXiv:2511.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among existing algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated strong performance, yet it suffers from a critical issue: low-probability tokens disproportionately dominate gradient updates due to their inherently large gradient magnitudes. This imbalance leads to unstable training and suppresses the contribution of high-probability tokens that are more reliable for learning. In this work, we introduce Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that assigns token-level weights positively correlated with the model's predicted probability. By downweighting low-probability tokens and emphasizing high-probability ones, TR-GRPO mitigates gradient over-amplification while preserving informative learning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TR-GRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across RLVR tasks, including logic, math, and agentic reasoning, highlighting the importance of regulating token contributions during RL training and establishing TR-GRPO as a robust framework for enhancing LLM reasoning.

This study addresses domain generalization for vision-language models without explicit domain labels. They propose representing unseen domains as combinations of latent domains discovered from training data to enable adaptive knowledge transfer. They perform latent domain clustering on image features and fuse domain-specific text features based on similarity to each latent domain.

arXiv:2511.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enable models to be robust against domain shift. DG is crucial for deploying vision-language models (VLMs) in real-world applications, yet most existing methods rely on domain labels that may not be available and often ambiguous. We instead study the DG setting where models must generalize well without access to explicit domain labels. Our key idea is to represent an unseen target domain as a combination of latent domains automatically discovered from training data, enabling the model to adaptively transfer knowledge across domains. To realize this, we perform latent domain clustering on image features and fuse domain-specific text features based on the similarity between the input image and each latent domain. Experiments on four benchmarks show that this strategy yields consistent gains over VLM-based baselines and provides new insights into improving robustness under domain shift.

arXiv:2511.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as generative optimizers for solving constrained multi-objective regression tasks, specifically within the challenging domain of inverse design (property-to-structure mapping). This problem, critical to materials informatics, demands finding complex, feasible input vectors that lie on the Pareto optimal front. While LLMs have demonstrated universal effectiveness across generative and reasoning tasks, their utility in constrained, continuous, high-dimensional numerical spaces tasks they weren't explicitly architected for remains an open research question. We conducted a rigorous comparative study between established Bayesian Optimization (BO) frameworks and a suite of fine-tuned LLMs and BERT models. For BO, we benchmarked the foundational BoTorch Ax implementation against the state-of-the-art q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI, BoTorchM). The generative approach involved fine-tuning models via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), framing the challenge as a regression problem with a custom output head. Our results show that BoTorch qEHVI achieved perfect convergence (GD=0.0), setting the performance ceiling. Crucially, the best-performing LLM (WizardMath-7B) achieved a Generational Distance (GD) of 1.21, significantly outperforming the traditional BoTorch Ax baseline (GD=15.03). We conclude that specialized BO frameworks remain the performance leader for guaranteed convergence, but fine-tuned LLMs are validated as a promising, computationally fast alternative, contributing essential comparative metrics to the field of AI-driven optimization. The findings have direct industrial applications in optimizing formulation design for resins, polymers, and paints, where multi-objective trade-offs between mechanical, rheological, and chemical properties are critical to innovation and production efficiency.

arXiv:2511.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a deliberately over-engineered approach to the classical problem of parity detection -- determining whether a number is odd or even -- by combining wavelet-based feature extraction with unsupervised clustering. Instead of relying on modular arithmetic, integers are transformed into wavelet-domain representations, from which multi-scale statistical features are extracted and clustered using the k-means algorithm. The resulting feature space reveals meaningful structural differences between odd and even numbers, achieving a classification accuracy of approximately 69.67% without any label supervision. These results suggest that classical signal-processing techniques, originally designed for continuous data, can uncover latent structure even in purely discrete symbolic domains. Beyond parity detection, the study provides an illustrative perspective on how feature engineering and clustering may be repurposed for unconventional machine learning problems, potentially bridging symbolic reasoning and feature-based learning.

Summary:
This study explores the capability of Vision-language Models (VLMs) to understand the geometric structure of visual information through the recognition of pictographic characters represented as executable programs of geometric primitives. The model, acting as a "visual decompiler", outperforms strong zero-shot baselines like GPT-4o by decompiling raster images into programs composed of Bezier curves. The significant finding is the model's ability to reconstruct ancient Oracle Bone Script in a zero-shot context when trained solely on modern Chinese characters, indicating a transferable geometric grammar acquisition. This demonstrates a move towards more structured visual understanding beyond pixel-level pattern recognition. <div>

Abstract: While Vision-language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic capabilities, their ability to interpret the underlying geometric structure of visual information is less explored. Pictographic characters, which combine visual form with symbolic structure, provide an ideal test case for this capability. We formulate this visual recognition challenge in the mathematical domain, where each character is represented by an executable program of geometric primitives. This is framed as a program synthesis task, training a VLM to decompile raster images into programs composed of B\'ezier curves. Our model, acting as a "visual decompiler", demonstrates performance superior to strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o. The most significant finding is that when trained solely on modern Chinese characters, the model is able to reconstruct ancient Oracle Bone Script in a zero-shot context. This generalization provides strong evidence that the model acquires an abstract and transferable geometric grammar, moving beyond pixel-level pattern recognition to a more structured form of visual understanding.

It emphasizes the importance of transparency and extensibility by introducing a modular architecture of standardized engines for various tasks in the modeling pipeline. Each engine serves a specific function but communicates through a lightweight interface, allowing for easy integration and comparison of interventions. By structuring fairness methods as interchangeable engines, researchers can evaluate and compare different strategies while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. The architecture can be applied not only to fairness but also to other workflow contexts where reproducibility, transparency, and extensibility are crucial. Overall, flowengineR provides a general infrastructure for building complex machine learning pipelines while prioritizing reproducibility and transparency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: flowengineR is an R package designed to provide a modular and extensible framework for building reproducible algorithmic workflows for general-purpose machine learning pipelines. It is motivated by the rapidly evolving field of algorithmic fairness where new metrics, mitigation strategies, and machine learning methods continuously emerge. A central challenge in fairness, but also far beyond, is that existing toolkits either focus narrowly on single interventions or treat reproducibility and extensibility as secondary considerations rather than core design principles. flowengineR addresses this by introducing a unified architecture of standardized engines for data splitting, execution, preprocessing, training, inprocessing, postprocessing, evaluation, and reporting. Each engine encapsulates one methodological task yet communicates via a lightweight interface, ensuring workflows remain transparent, auditable, and easily extensible. Although implemented in R, flowengineR builds on ideas from workflow languages (CWL, YAWL), graph-oriented visual programming languages (KNIME), and R frameworks (BatchJobs, batchtools). Its emphasis, however, is less on orchestrating engines for resilient parallel execution but rather on the straightforward setup and management of distinct engines as data structures. This orthogonalization enables distributed responsibilities, independent development, and streamlined integration. In fairness context, by structuring fairness methods as interchangeable engines, flowengineR lets researchers integrate, compare, and evaluate interventions across the modeling pipeline. At the same time, the architecture generalizes to explainability, robustness, and compliance metrics without core modifications. While motivated by fairness, it ultimately provides a general infrastructure for any workflow context where reproducibility, transparency, and extensibility are essential.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Fixed-point iterative graph convolutional network (Fix-GCN) model, designed to enhance the robustness of graph neural networks against adversarial attacks. By effectively capturing higher-order node neighborhood information without adding complexity, the model utilizes a versatile spectral modulation filter and a feature propagation rule derived from fixed-point iteration. Unlike traditional defense mechanisms, Fix-GCN's filter allows selective attenuation of high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency structural information, offering a flexible and efficient framework. Through iterative node representation updates, the model effectively preserves essential graph information while mitigating adversarial manipulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the model's resilience against attacks, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing the integrity and performance of graph neural networks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant risk to the integrity and performance of graph neural networks, particularly in tasks where graph structure and node features are vulnerable to manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel model, called fixed-point iterative graph convolutional network (Fix-GCN), which achieves robustness against adversarial perturbations by effectively capturing higher-order node neighborhood information in the graph without additional memory or computational complexity. Specifically, we introduce a versatile spectral modulation filter and derive the feature propagation rule of our model using fixed-point iteration. Unlike traditional defense mechanisms that rely on additional design elements to counteract attacks, the proposed graph filter provides a flexible-pass filtering approach, allowing it to selectively attenuate high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency structural information in the graph signal. By iteratively updating node representations, our model offers a flexible and efficient framework for preserving essential graph information while mitigating the impact of adversarial manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through extensive experiments on various benchmark graph datasets, showcasing its resilience against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: In recent years, the pen and paper RPG market has experienced significant growth. As a result, companies are increasingly exploring the integration of AI technologies to enhance player experience and gain a competitive edge.
  One of the key challenges faced by publishers is designing new opponents and estimating their challenge level. Currently, there are no automated methods for determining a monster's level; the only approaches used are based on manual testing and expert evaluation. Although these manual methods can provide reasonably accurate estimates, they are time-consuming and resource-intensive.
  Level prediction can be approached using ordinal regression techniques. This thesis presents an overview and evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for this task. It also details the construction of a dedicated dataset for level estimation. Furthermore, a human-inspired model was developed to serve as a benchmark, allowing comparison between machine learning algorithms and the approach typically employed by pen and paper RPG publishers. In addition, a specialized evaluation procedure, grounded in domain knowledge, was designed to assess model performance and facilitate meaningful comparisons.

Summary:
MaGNet is a novel dual-hyperGraph Network designed for stock trend prediction, addressing challenges such as temporal dependencies and dynamic inter-stock interactions. It introduces innovative features such as the MAGE block for contextual temporal modeling, multi-head attention for capturing global dependencies, and Feature-wise and Stock-wise 2D Spatiotemporal Attention modules for precise fusion of multivariate features. MaGNet also employs a dual hypergraph framework consisting of the Temporal-Causal Hypergraph and Global Probabilistic Hypergraph to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and market-wide patterns. Experimental results on six major stock indices show that MaGNet outperforms existing methods in predictive performance and investment returns while also offering robust risk management capabilities. The code for MaGNet is available on GitHub for further exploration and use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock trend prediction is crucial for profitable trading strategies and portfolio management yet remains challenging due to market volatility, complex temporal dynamics and multifaceted inter-stock relationships. Existing methods struggle to effectively capture temporal dependencies and dynamic inter-stock interactions, often neglecting cross-sectional market influences, relying on static correlations, employing uniform treatments of nodes and edges, and conflating diverse relationships. This work introduces MaGNet, a novel Mamba dual-hyperGraph Network for stock prediction, integrating three key innovations: (1) a MAGE block, which leverages bidirectional Mamba with adaptive gating mechanisms for contextual temporal modeling and integrates a sparse Mixture-of-Experts layer to enable dynamic adaptation to diverse market conditions, alongside multi-head attention for capturing global dependencies; (2) Feature-wise and Stock-wise 2D Spatiotemporal Attention modules enable precise fusion of multivariate features and cross-stock dependencies, effectively enhancing informativeness while preserving intrinsic data structures, bridging temporal modeling with relational reasoning; and (3) a dual hypergraph framework consisting of the Temporal-Causal Hypergraph (TCH) that captures fine-grained causal dependencies with temporal constraints, and Global Probabilistic Hypergraph (GPH) that models market-wide patterns through soft hyperedge assignments and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism, jointly disentangling localized temporal influences from instantaneous global structures for multi-scale relational learning. Extensive experiments on six major stock indices demonstrate MaGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both superior predictive performance and exceptional investment returns with robust risk management capabilities.

<div> optimization, large language models, test-time scaling, collaboration graphs, Agent-REINFORCE  
Summary:  
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) aims to improve large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. This study addresses the challenge of finding compute-optimal model combinations and architectures in TTS within a fixed budget. The problem is formulated as a multi-LLM collaboration graph, where nodes represent roles and model assignments, and edges capture information flow. The researchers propose Agent-REINFORCE, a framework that leverages LLM agents to efficiently search for optimal collaboration graphs by updating a probabilistic graph based on feedback. Experiment results demonstrate that Agent-REINFORCE outperforms traditional and LLM-based approaches in sample efficiency and search performance, efficiently identifying optimal graphs that balance accuracy and inference latency. <div>
arXiv:2511.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference, typically through parallel, sequential, or hybrid scaling. However, prior studies often assume fixed collaboration architectures (e.g., topologies) and single-model usage, overlooking that optimal architectures and model combinations can vary across tasks. Therefore, we study the novel problem of searching for compute-optimal model combinations and architectures in TTS under a fixed budget. We formalize it as a multi-LLM collaboration graph, where nodes encode roles and LLM model assignments, and edges capture information flow. This problem is challenging because (i) the combinatorial search space is prohibitively large, and (ii) task-specific requirements demand tailored designs. To address these, we reformulate the problem as probabilistic graph optimization and, through pilot experiments, derive three empirical insights into TTS collaboration graphs. Guided by these insights, we propose Agent-REINFORCE, an LLM-agent-augmented framework that mirrors the REINFORCE pipeline by mapping sampling-gradient-update to sampling-feedback-update, where feedback serves as a textual gradient to update the probabilistic graph and efficiently search for optimal multi-LLM collaboration graphs. Experiments show that Agent-REINFORCE outperforms both traditional and LLM-based baselines in sample efficiency and search performance, and effectively identifies optimal graphs under joint objectives of accuracy and inference latency.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces GraphKeeper, a novel approach for Graph Domain-Incremental Learning (Domain-IL) that addresses catastrophic forgetting in scenarios involving multiple graph domains. GraphKeeper focuses on preventing embedding shifts and confusion across incremental graph domains by incorporating domain-specific parameter-efficient fine-tuning and disentanglement objectives. Additionally, it introduces deviation-free knowledge preservation to maintain a stable decision boundary between domains. For graphs with unobservable domains, GraphKeeper employs domain-aware distribution discrimination to obtain accurate embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphKeeper achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement over existing methods while mitigating forgetting. The approach is also shown to be easily integrated with various graph foundation models, showcasing its broad applicability. <div>
arXiv:2511.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph incremental learning (GIL), which continuously updates graph models by sequential knowledge acquisition, has garnered significant interest recently. However, existing GIL approaches focus on task-incremental and class-incremental scenarios within a single domain. Graph domain-incremental learning (Domain-IL), aiming at updating models across multiple graph domains, has become critical with the development of graph foundation models (GFMs), but remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we propose Graph Domain-Incremental Learning via Knowledge Dientanglement and Preservation (GraphKeeper), to address catastrophic forgetting in Domain-IL scenario from the perspectives of embedding shifts and decision boundary deviations. Specifically, to prevent embedding shifts and confusion across incremental graph domains, we first propose the domain-specific parameter-efficient fine-tuning together with intra- and inter-domain disentanglement objectives. Consequently, to maintain a stable decision boundary, we introduce deviation-free knowledge preservation to continuously fit incremental domains. Additionally, for graphs with unobservable domains, we perform domain-aware distribution discrimination to obtain precise embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed GraphKeeper achieves state-of-the-art results with 6.5%~16.6% improvement over the runner-up with negligible forgetting. Moreover, we show GraphKeeper can be seamlessly integrated with various representative GFMs, highlighting its broad applicative potential.

Summary: 
The study focuses on a novel methodology for damage detection and digital twinning using a conditional-labeled generative adversarial network. This approach does not require prior information about the health state of the system, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios. By utilizing unsupervised framework, the method was tested on Z24 Bridge structural health monitoring data and showed improved performance in fault anomaly detection. The model generated measurements for digital twinning at different damage states without the need for physics knowledge. Additionally, a support vector machine classifier and principal component analysis were developed to assess the generated measurements and provide a secondary indicator for identifying damage scenarios. The approach accurately captured damage over healthy measurements, making it a valuable tool for vibration-based system monitoring and infrastructure resilience at scale. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization-based damage detection and damage state digital twinning capabilities are examined here of a novel conditional-labeled generative adversarial network methodology. The framework outperforms current approaches for fault anomaly detection as no prior information is required for the health state of the system: a topic of high significance for real-world applications. Specifically, current artificial intelligence-based digital twinning approaches suffer from the uncertainty related to obtaining poor predictions when a low number of measurements is available, physics knowledge is missing, or when the damage state is unknown. To this end, an unsupervised framework is examined and validated rigorously on the benchmark structural health monitoring measurements of Z24 Bridge: a post-tensioned concrete highway bridge in Switzerland. In implementing the approach, firstly, different same damage-level measurements are used as inputs, while the model is forced to converge conditionally to two different damage states. Secondly, the process is repeated for a different group of measurements. Finally, the convergence scores are compared to identify which one belongs to a different damage state. The process for both healthy-to-healthy and damage-to-healthy input data creates, simultaneously, measurements for digital twinning purposes at different damage states, capable of pattern recognition and machine learning data generation. Further to this process, a support vector machine classifier and a principal component analysis procedure is developed to assess the generated and real measurements of each damage category, serving as a secondary new dynamics learning indicator in damage scenarios. Importantly, the approach is shown to capture accurately damage over healthy measurements, providing a powerful tool for vibration-based system-level monitoring and scalable infrastructure resilience.

Abstract: The dynamic structural load identification capabilities of the gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, and convolutional neural networks are examined herein. The examination is on realistic small dataset training conditions and on a comparative view to the physics-based residual Kalman filter (RKF). The dynamic load identification suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining poor predictions when in civil engineering applications only a low number of tests are performed or are available, or when the structural model is unidentifiable. In considering the methods, first, a simulated structure is investigated under a shaker excitation at the top floor. Second, a building in California is investigated under seismic base excitation, which results in loading for all degrees of freedom. Finally, the International Association for Structural Control-American Society of Civil Engineers (IASC-ASCE) structural health monitoring benchmark problem is examined for impact and instant loading conditions. Importantly, the methods are shown to outperform each other on different loading scenarios, while the RKF is shown to outperform the networks in physically parametrized identifiable cases.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While prior work has explored strategies for integrating LLM training and serving, there still remains a gap in unifying fine-tuning and inference for LoRA-based models. We present Loquetier, a virtualized multi-LoRA framework that seamlessly integrates LoRA fine-tuning and serving within a single runtime. Loquetier introduces two key components: (1) a Virtualized Module that isolates PEFT-based modifications and supports multiple adapters on a shared base model, and (2) an optimized computation flow with a kernel design that merges fine-tuning and inference paths in forward propagation, enabling efficient batching and minimizing kernel invocation overhead. Extensive experiments across three task settings show that Loquetier consistently outperforms existing baselines in both performance and flexibility, achieving up to $3.0\times$ the throughput of the state-of-the-art co-serving system on inference-only tasks and $46.4\times$ higher SLO attainment than PEFT on unified fine-tuning and inference tasks.

Abstract: The discovery of conservation laws is a cornerstone of scientific progress. However, identifying these invariants from observational data remains a significant challenge. We propose a hybrid framework to automate the discovery of conserved quantities from noisy trajectory data. Our approach integrates three components: (1) a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that learns a continuous model of the system's dynamics, (2) a Transformer that generates symbolic candidate invariants conditioned on the learned vector field, and (3) a symbolic-numeric verifier that provides a strong numerical certificate for the validity of these candidates. We test our framework on canonical physical systems and show that it significantly outperforms baselines that operate directly on trajectory data. This work demonstrates the robustness of a decoupled learn-then-search approach for discovering mathematical principles from imperfect data.

Abstract: This report presents Pelican-VL 1.0, a new family of open-source embodied brain models with parameter scales ranging from 7 billion to 72 billion. Our explicit mission is clearly stated as: To embed powerful intelligence into various embodiments. Pelican-VL 1.0 is currently the largest-scale open-source embodied multimodal brain model.

This translates to a 20.3% performance uplift from its base model and outperforms 100B-level open-source counterparts by 10.6%, placing it on par with leading proprietary systems on well-known embodied benchmarks. We establish a novel framework, DPPO (Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization), inspired by human metacognition to train Pelican-VL 1.0. We operationalize this as a metaloop that teaches the AI to practice deliberately, which is a RL-Refine-Diagnose-SFT loop.

<div> Keywords: Spectral Graph Neural Networks, Meixner polynomials, GNN architecture, Laplacian scaling, LayerNorm

Summary: 
MeixnerNet introduces a novel spectral Graph Neural Network architecture that utilizes discrete Meixner polynomials. The model's key innovation is the ability to learn the shape parameters of the polynomials, beta, and c, making the filter adaptable to the graph's specific spectral properties. A novel stabilization technique is introduced to address numerical instability. Experimental results show MeixnerNet outperforms ChebyNet at the optimal setting and exhibits exceptional robustness to variations in polynomial degree K. ChebyNet, on the other hand, is highly sensitive to changes in K, leading to a significant performance drop. MeixnerNet's adaptability and stability make it a promising alternative to traditional spectral GNN architectures.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results by defining graph convolutions in the spectral domain. A common approach, popularized by ChebyNet, is to use polynomial filters based on continuous orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev). This creates a theoretical disconnect, as these continuous-domain filters are applied to inherently discrete graph structures. We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal performance and fragility to hyperparameter settings.
  In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture that employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner polynomials $M_k(x; \beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of the polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its polynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We overcome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by introducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling with per-basis LayerNorm.
  We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves competitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the optimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks). More critically, we show that MeixnerNet is exceptionally robust to variations in the polynomial degree K, a hyperparameter to which ChebyNet proves to be highly fragile, collapsing in performance where MeixnerNet remains stable.

Summary:<br /><br />Liquid cooling is essential for managing the thermal challenges in high-density data centers, especially with increasing AI workloads. To enhance energy efficiency and reliability, machine learning-based controllers play a vital role. LC-Opt, a Sustainable Liquid Cooling (LC) benchmark environment, has been developed for implementing reinforcement learning (RL) control strategies in energy-efficient liquid cooling systems for high-performance computing (HPC). This platform utilizes detailed end-to-end models, including site-level cooling towers, data center cabinets, and server blade groups. RL agents optimize key thermal controls such as liquid supply temperature and flow rate at the IT cabinet level, and cooling tower setpoints, facilitating dynamic workload changes. The environment presents a real-time optimization challenge that balances local thermal regulation and global energy efficiency, supporting the integration of additional components like a heat recovery unit (HRU). LC-Opt allows for the development of sustainable liquid cooling control solutions by providing access to detailed and customizable models for the ML community, operators, and vendors. <div>

Abstract: Liquid cooling is critical for thermal management in high-density data centers with the rising AI workloads. However, machine learning-based controllers are essential to unlock greater energy efficiency and reliability, promoting sustainability. We present LC-Opt, a Sustainable Liquid Cooling (LC) benchmark environment, for reinforcement learning (RL) control strategies in energy-efficient liquid cooling of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Built on the baseline of a high-fidelity digital twin of Oak Ridge National Lab's Frontier Supercomputer cooling system, LC-Opt provides detailed Modelica-based end-to-end models spanning site-level cooling towers to data center cabinets and server blade groups. RL agents optimize critical thermal controls like liquid supply temperature, flow rate, and granular valve actuation at the IT cabinet level, as well as cooling tower (CT) setpoints through a Gymnasium interface, with dynamic changes in workloads. This environment creates a multi-objective real-time optimization challenge balancing local thermal regulation and global energy efficiency, and also supports additional components like a heat recovery unit (HRU). We benchmark centralized and decentralized multi-agent RL approaches, demonstrate policy distillation into decision and regression trees for interpretable control, and explore LLM-based methods that explain control actions in natural language through an agentic mesh architecture designed to foster user trust and simplify system management. LC-Opt democratizes access to detailed, customizable liquid cooling models, enabling the ML community, operators, and vendors to develop sustainable data center liquid cooling control solutions.

Abstract: The increasing energy demands and carbon footprint of large-scale AI require intelligent workload management in globally distributed data centers. Yet progress is limited by the absence of benchmarks that realistically capture the interplay of time-varying environmental factors (grid carbon intensity, electricity prices, weather), detailed data center physics (CPUs, GPUs, memory, HVAC energy), and geo-distributed network dynamics (latency and transmission costs). To bridge this gap, we present DCcluster-Opt: an open-source, high-fidelity simulation benchmark for sustainable, geo-temporal task scheduling. DCcluster-Opt combines curated real-world datasets, including AI workload traces, grid carbon intensity, electricity markets, weather across 20 global regions, cloud transmission costs, and empirical network delay parameters with physics-informed models of data center operations, enabling rigorous and reproducible research in sustainable computing. It presents a challenging scheduling problem where a top-level coordinating agent must dynamically reassign or defer tasks that arrive with resource and service-level agreement requirements across a configurable cluster of data centers to optimize multiple objectives. The environment also models advanced components such as heat recovery. A modular reward system enables an explicit study of trade-offs among carbon emissions, energy costs, service level agreements, and water use. It provides a Gymnasium API with baseline controllers, including reinforcement learning and rule-based strategies, to support reproducible ML research and a fair comparison of diverse algorithms. By offering a realistic, configurable, and accessible testbed, DCcluster-Opt accelerates the development and validation of next-generation sustainable computing solutions for geo-distributed data centers.

Summary:
The study focuses on predicting Line Breaks in football, using event and tracking data from the 2023 J1 League season. A machine learning model with 189 features, including player positions and velocities, was developed, achieving high predictive accuracy. Factors such as player speed, defensive line gaps, and offensive players' spatial distributions were found to significantly influence Line Breaks. The model also showed a correlation between Line Breaks and shots and crosses conceded at the team level, highlighting the connection between Line Breaks and creating scoring opportunities. This research provides valuable insights into the tactical dynamics of football and emphasizes the importance of Line Breaks in offensive effectiveness. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In football, attacking teams attempt to break through the opponent's defensive line to create scoring opportunities. This action, known as a Line Break, is a critical indicator of offensive effectiveness and tactical performance, yet previous studies have mainly focused on shots or goal opportunities rather than on how teams break the defensive line. In this study, we develop a machine learning model to predict Line Breaks using event and tracking data from the 2023 J1 League season. The model incorporates 189 features, including player positions, velocities, and spatial configurations, and employs an XGBoost classifier to estimate the probability of Line Breaks. The proposed model achieved high predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.982 and a Brier score of 0.015. Furthermore, SHAP analysis revealed that factors such as offensive player speed, gaps in the defensive line, and offensive players' spatial distributions significantly contribute to the occurrence of Line Breaks. Finally, we found a moderate positive correlation between the predicted probability of being Line-Broken and the number of shots and crosses conceded at the team level. These results suggest that Line Breaks are closely linked to the creation of scoring opportunities and provide a quantitative framework for understanding tactical dynamics in football.

<div> sampling dynamics, score-based diffusion models, cross-fluctuations, transitions, generative modeling
Summary: 
The article explores the evolution of sampling dynamics in score-based diffusion models using cross-fluctuations. It demonstrates that starting from an unbiased normal distribution, samples go through discrete transitions to form distinct events of a desired distribution. These transitions are reversible, leading back to the initial distribution. Detecting these transitions through n-th order cross-fluctuations improves sampling efficiency, class-conditional and rare-class generation, as well as tasks like image classification and style transfer. The framework unifies classical coupling and mixing from finite Markov chains with continuous dynamics, extending to stochastic SDEs and non-Markovian samplers. The study bridges discrete Markov chain theory, phase analysis, and modern generative modeling. <div>
arXiv:2511.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse how the sampling dynamics of distributions evolve in score-based diffusion models using cross-fluctuations, a centered-moment statistic from statistical physics. Specifically, we show that starting from an unbiased isotropic normal distribution, samples undergo sharp, discrete transitions, eventually forming distinct events of a desired distribution while progressively revealing finer structure. As this process is reversible, these transitions also occur in reverse, where intermediate states progressively merge, tracing a path back to the initial distribution. We demonstrate that these transitions can be detected as discontinuities in $n^{\text{th}}$-order cross-fluctuations. For variance-preserving SDEs, we derive a closed-form for these cross-fluctuations that is efficiently computable for the reverse trajectory. We find that detecting these transitions directly boosts sampling efficiency, accelerates class-conditional and rare-class generation, and improves two zero-shot tasks--image classification and style transfer--without expensive grid search or retraining. We also show that this viewpoint unifies classical coupling and mixing from finite Markov chains with continuous dynamics while extending to stochastic SDEs and non Markovian samplers. Our framework therefore bridges discrete Markov chain theory, phase analysis, and modern generative modeling.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a dynamic multi-expert gating framework for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, addressing the limitations of traditional one-model-fits-all approaches. By adaptively selecting the most reliable trajectory predictor among different models based on internal model signals, the proposed method outperforms advanced networks in complex driving scenarios. The framework leverages meta-features like stability and uncertainty for expert selection, improving decision quality without post-hoc calibration. Evaluation on the nuPlan-mini dataset shows a significant reduction in Final Displacement Error compared to existing models, demonstrating consistent improvements in both offline validation and open-loop simulations. This approach enhances trajectory reliability in safety-critical driving situations, offering a practical alternative to static single-model paradigms. <div>
arXiv:2511.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deep trajectory predictors (e.g., Jiang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2022) have achieved strong average accuracy but remain unreliable in complex long-tail driving scenarios. These limitations reveal the weakness of the prevailing "one-model-fits-all" paradigm, particularly in safety-critical urban contexts where simpler physics-based models can occasionally outperform advanced networks (Kalman, 1960). To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamic multi-expert gating framework that adaptively selects the most reliable trajectory predictor among a physics-informed LSTM, a Transformer, and a fine-tuned GameFormer on a per-sample basis.
  Our method leverages internal model signals (meta-features) such as stability and uncertainty (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), which we demonstrate to be substantially more informative than geometric scene descriptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate trajectory expert selection as a pairwise-ranking problem over internal model signals (Burges et al., 2005), directly optimizing decision quality without requiring post-hoc calibration.
  Evaluated on the nuPlan-mini dataset (Caesar et al., 2021) with 1,287 samples, our LLM-enhanced tri-expert gate achieves a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 2.567 m, representing a 9.5 percent reduction over GameFormer (2.835 m), and realizes 57.8 percent of the oracle performance bound. In open-loop simulations, after trajectory horizon alignment, the same configuration reduces FDE on left-turn scenarios by approximately 10 percent, demonstrating consistent improvements across both offline validation and open-loop evaluation. These results indicate that adaptive hybrid systems enhance trajectory reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving, providing a practical pathway beyond static single-model paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network-based CCL signal recognition has achieved significant progress in collar identification, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into downhole tools for CCL signal acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. We propose comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation and evaluate their effectiveness using our AlexNet-based neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across various configuration combinations, we analyze the contribution of each augmentation method. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing (LDS), and random cropping are fundamental requirements for model training, while label smoothing regularization (LSR), time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capability. The F1 scores of our two benchmark models trained with the proposed augmentation methods maximumly improve from 0.937 and 0.952 to 1.0 and 1.0, respectively. Performance validation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models in CCL data-limited environments.

Summary: The paper compares Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and In-Context Learning (ICL) as adaptation strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) in data-scarce scenarios. While SFT is effective at skill acquisition, it is prone to catastrophic forgetting. LoRA minimizes parameter changes and strikes a good balance between instilling new skills and preserving general knowledge. ICL is useful for incorporating factual knowledge but struggles with complex skills. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate adaptation strategy based on the task requirements. It distinguishes between skill acquisition and knowledge integration, outlining the trade-offs between task-specific performance and maintaining general capabilities in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) often need to be tailored for specific applications, requiring the integration of new knowledge or the acquisition of new skills. While full fine-tuning is a powerful adaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a degradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own trade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length, while Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes. However, the challenge of catastrophic forgetting persists, raising questions about the best adaptation strategy for a given task. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and ICL in data-scarce scenarios. We find that LoRA provides the most effective balance, successfully instilling new skills with minimal impact on the base model's general knowledge. In contrast, while SFT excels at skill acquisition, it is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. ICL is effective for incorporating factual knowledge but struggles with complex skills. Our findings offer a practical framework for selecting an LLM adaptation strategy. We highlight the critical distinction between skill acquisition and knowledge integration, clarify the trade-offs between task-specific performance and the preservation of general capabilities.

<div> Keywords: vegetation, cooling, heat index, humidity, urban areas

Summary:<br /><br />Efforts to green cities for cooling are progressing in some cities but creating challenges in others due to the trade-off between cooling surfaces and increasing humidity. This study focuses on 138 Indian cities across different climates and urban densities to understand how vegetation influences the Heat Index (HI), a measure of temperature and humidity. The research reveals that while vegetation can enhance cooling, highly active vegetation can actually contribute to higher perceived heat stress by elevating humidity faster than it removes heat. The study identifies specific thresholds for vegetation structure and function, such as EVI, LAI, and fPAR, that determine when vegetation transitions from cooling to warming effects. These findings highlight the importance of climate-specific greening strategies in developing heat-resilient and equitable cities. <div>
arXiv:2511.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to green cities for cooling are succeeding unevenly because the same vegetation that cools surfaces can also intensify how hot the air feels. Previous studies have identified humid heat as a growing urban hazard, yet how physiologically active vegetation governs this trade-off between cooling and moisture accumulation remains poorly understood, leaving mitigation policy and design largely unguided. Here we quantify how vegetation structure and function influence the Heat Index (HI), a combined measure of temperature and humidity in 138 Indian cities spanning tropical savanna, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical climates, and across dense urban cores and semi-urban rings. Using an extreme-aware, one kilometre reconstruction of HI and an interpretable machine-learning framework that integrates SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), we isolate vegetation-climate interactions. Cooling generally strengthens for EVI >= 0.4 and LAI >= 0.05, but joint-high regimes begin to reverse toward warming when EVI >= 0.5, LAI >= 0.2, and fPAR >= 0.5,with an earlier onset for fPAR >= 0.25 in humid, dense cores. In such environments, highly physiologically active vegetation elevates near-surface humidity faster than it removes heat, reversing its cooling effect and amplifying perceived heat stress. These findings establish the climatic limits of vegetation-driven cooling and provide quantitative thresholds for climate-specific greening strategies that promote equitable and heat-resilient cities.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

<div> race, Sparse Autoencoders, bias, healthcare, LLMs

Summary: 
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are assessed for their ability to detect and control associations between race and stigmatizing concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) used in healthcare. SAE latents in Gemma-2 models are identified that correlate with Black individuals, activating on reasonable input sequences but also problematic words like "incarceration". This latent can steer models to generate biased outputs about Black patients, increasing the risk assigned to negative behaviors. While SAEs show potential in identifying bias, mitigating it through latent steering is limited in effectiveness for complex clinical tasks. Overall, the study suggests that SAEs can be a useful tool in clinical applications of LLMs to identify bias based on demographics, but mitigation through SAE steering may have limited utility for realistic healthcare scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being used in healthcare. This promises to free physicians from drudgery, enabling better care to be delivered at scale. But the use of LLMs in this space also brings risks; for example, such models may worsen existing biases. How can we spot when LLMs are (spuriously) relying on patient race to inform predictions? In this work we assess the degree to which Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has made between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in Gemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that this latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g., "African American") but also problematic words like "incarceration". We then show that we can use this latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and further that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a result. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to the probability that a patient will become "belligerent". We evaluate the degree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias. We find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less successful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks. Overall, our results suggest that: SAEs may offer a useful tool in clinical applications of LLMs to identify problematic reliance on demographics but mitigating bias via SAE steering appears to be of marginal utility for realistic tasks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces PDE-SHARP, a framework that reduces computational costs in generating PDE solvers by using machine learning. The framework consists of three stages: Analysis, Genesis, and Synthesis. Through mathematical analysis, solver generation, and collaborative selection tournaments, PDE-SHARP significantly decreases the number of solver evaluations needed compared to baseline methods. It achieves superior solver accuracy with 60-75% fewer computational evaluations, improving accuracy by 4 times on average across tested PDEs.

Abstract: Current LLM-driven approaches using test-time computing to generate PDE solvers execute a large number of solver samples to identify high-accuracy solvers. These paradigms are especially costly for complex PDEs requiring substantial computational resources for numerical evaluation. We introduce PDE-SHARP, a framework to reduce computational costs by replacing expensive scientific computation by cheaper LLM inference that achieves superior solver accuracy with 60-75% fewer computational evaluations. PDE-SHARP employs three stages: (1) Analysis: mathematical chain-of-thought analysis including PDE classification, solution type detection, and stability analysis; (2) Genesis: solver generation based on mathematical insights from the previous stage; and (3) Synthesis: collaborative selection-hybridization tournaments in which LLM judges iteratively refine implementations through flexible performance feedback. To generate high-quality solvers, PDE-SHARP requires fewer than 13 solver evaluations on average compared to 30+ for baseline methods, improving accuracy uniformly across tested PDEs by $4\times$ on average, and demonstrates robust performance across LLM architectures, from general-purpose to specialized reasoning models.

<title>EL-MIA: Quantifying Membership Inference Risks of Sensitive Entities in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00192</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIA) aim to infer whether a particular data point is part of the training dataset of a model. In this paper, we propose a new task in the context of LLM privacy: entity-level discovery of membership risk focused on sensitive information (PII, credit card numbers, etc). Existing methods for MIA can detect the presence of entire prompts or documents in the LLM training data, but they fail to capture risks at a finer granularity. We propose the ``EL-MIA'' framework for auditing entity-level membership risks in LLMs. We construct a benchmark dataset for the evaluation of MIA methods on this task. Using this benchmark, we conduct a systematic comparison of existing MIA techniques as well as two newly proposed methods. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the results, trying to explain the relation of the entity level MIA susceptability with the model scale, training epochs, and other surface level factors. Our findings reveal that existing MIA methods are limited when it comes to entity-level membership inference of the sensitive attributes, while this susceptibility can be outlined with relatively straightforward methods, highlighting the need for stronger adversaries to stress test the provided threat model.

<title>Diffusion LLMs are Natural Adversaries for any LLM</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that transforms the resource-intensive (adversarial) prompt optimization problem into an \emph{efficient, amortized inference task}. Our core insight is that pretrained, non-autoregressive generative LLMs, such as Diffusion LLMs, which model the joint distribution over prompt-response pairs, can serve as powerful surrogates for prompt search. This approach enables the direct conditional generation of prompts, effectively replacing costly, per-instance discrete optimization with a small number of parallelizable samples. We provide a probabilistic analysis demonstrating that under mild fidelity assumptions, only a few conditional samples are required to recover high-reward (harmful) prompts. Empirically, we find that the generated prompts are low-perplexity, diverse jailbreaks that exhibit strong transferability to a wide range of black-box target models, including robustly trained and proprietary LLMs. Beyond adversarial prompting, our framework opens new directions for red teaming, automated prompt optimization, and leveraging emerging Flow- and Diffusion-based LLMs.

<title>Diffusion Models at the Drug Discovery Frontier: A Review on Generating Small Molecules versus Therapeutic Peptides</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00209</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, showing significant potential to accelerate and transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We analyze how a unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the need for more accurate scoring functions, the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, and the crucial requirement for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from chemical exploration to the targeted creation of novel therapeutics.

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models has emerged as a powerful approach for generating objects with specific desired properties. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an effective framework for this purpose, enabling models to generate outputs that maximize a given reward function. However, in many applications such as text generation and drug discovery, it can be suboptimal to optimize using a single reward signal, as multiple evaluation criteria are often necessary. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based method for fine-tuning foundation models using multiple reward signals. By employing an iterative fine-tuning strategy across these rewards, our approach generalizes state-of-the-art RL-based methods. We further provide a theoretical analysis that offers insights into the performance of multi-reward RL fine-tuning. Experimental results across diverse domains including text, biological sequence, and small molecule generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive and deadliest skin cancers, leading to mortality if not detected and treated in the early stages. Artificial intelligence techniques have recently been developed to help dermatologists in the early detection of melanoma, and systems based on deep learning (DL) have been able to detect these lesions with high accuracy. However, the entire community must overcome the explainability limit to get the maximum benefit from DL for diagnostics in the healthcare domain. Because of the black box operation's shortcomings in DL models' decisions, there is a lack of reliability and trust in the outcomes. However, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can solve this problem by interpreting the predictions of AI systems. This paper proposes a machine learning model using ensemble learning of three state-of-the-art deep transfer Learning networks, along with an approach to ensure the reliability of the predictions by utilizing XAI techniques to explain the basis of the predictions.

Abstract: We determine the minimax optimal expected regret in the classic non-stochastic multi-armed bandit with expert advice problem, by proving a lower bound that matches the upper bound of Kale (2014). The two bounds determine the minimax optimal expected regret to be $\Theta\left( \sqrt{T K \log (N/K) } \right)$, where $K$ is the number of arms, $N$ is the number of experts, and $T$ is the time horizon.

arXiv:2511.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, particularly the Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM), have addressed the limitations of traditional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks by introducing exponential gating and enhanced memory structures. These improvements make xLSTM suitable for time-series prediction tasks as they exhibit the ability to model long-term temporal dependencies better than LSTMs. Despite their potential, these xLSTM-based models remain largely unexplored in the context of vehicle trajectory prediction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel xLSTM-based vehicle trajectory prediction framework, X-TRAJ, and its physics-aware variant, X-TRACK (eXtended LSTM for TRAjectory prediction Constraint by Kinematics), which explicitly integrates vehicle motion kinematics into the model learning process. By introducing physical constraints, the proposed model generates realistic and feasible trajectories. A comprehensive evaluation on the highD and NGSIM datasets demonstrates that X-TRACK outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Improving the Robustness of Control of Chaotic Convective Flows with Domain-Informed Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic convective flows arise in many real-world systems, such as microfluidic devices and chemical reactors. Stabilizing these flows is highly desirable but remains challenging, particularly in chaotic regimes where conventional control methods often fail. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for control in laminar flow settings, but its ability to generalize and remain robust under chaotic and turbulent dynamics is not well explored, despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we improve the practical feasibility of RL-based control of such flows focusing on Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC), a canonical model for convective heat transport. To enhance generalization and sample efficiency, we introduce domain-informed RL agents that are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization across diverse initial conditions and flow regimes. We incorporate domain knowledge in the reward function via a term that encourages B\'enard cell merging, as an example of a desirable macroscopic property. In laminar flow regimes, the domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by up to 33%, and in chaotic flow regimes, they still achieve a 10% reduction, which is significantly better than the conventional controllers used in practice. We compare the domain-informed to uninformed agents: Our results show that the domain-informed reward design results in steady flows, faster convergence during training, and generalization across flow regimes without retraining. Our work demonstrates that elegant domain-informed priors can greatly enhance the robustness of RL-based control of chaotic flows, bringing real-world deployment closer.

<title>Calibration Across Layers: Understanding Calibration Evolution in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated inherent calibration capabilities, where predicted probabilities align well with correctness, despite prior findings that deep neural networks are often overconfident. Recent studies have linked this behavior to specific components in the final layer, such as entropy neurons and the unembedding matrix null space. In this work, we provide a complementary perspective by investigating how calibration evolves throughout the network depth. Analyzing multiple open-weight models on the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a distinct confidence correction phase in the upper/later layers, where model confidence is actively recalibrated after decision certainty has been reached. Furthermore, we identify a low-dimensional calibration direction in the residual stream whose perturbation significantly improves calibration metrics (ECE and MCE) without harming accuracy. Our findings suggest that calibration is a distributed phenomenon, shaped throughout the network forward pass, not just in its final projection, providing new insights into how confidence-regulating mechanisms operate within LLMs.

<title>A systematic evaluation of uncertainty quantification techniques in deep learning: a case study in photoplethysmography signal analysis</title>

arXiv:2511.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In principle, deep learning models trained on medical time-series, including wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor data, can provide a means to continuously monitor physiological parameters outside of clinical settings. However, there is considerable risk of poor performance when deployed in practical measurement scenarios leading to negative patient outcomes. Reliable uncertainties accompanying predictions can provide guidance to clinicians in their interpretation of the trustworthiness of model outputs. It is therefore of interest to compare the effectiveness of different approaches. Here we implement an unprecedented set of eight uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques to models trained on two clinically relevant prediction tasks: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection (classification), and two variants of blood pressure regression. We formulate a comprehensive evaluation procedure to enable a rigorous comparison of these approaches. We observe a complex picture of uncertainty reliability across the different techniques, where the most optimal for a given task depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty, evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessed. We find that assessing local calibration and adaptivity provides practically relevant insights about model behaviour that otherwise cannot be acquired using more commonly implemented global reliability metrics. We emphasise that criteria for evaluating UQ techniques should cater to the model's practical use case, where the use of a small number of measurements per patient places a premium on achieving small-scale reliability for the chosen expression of uncertainty, while preserving as much predictive performance as possible.

<title>A Technical Exploration of Causal Inference with Hybrid LLM Synthetic Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a flexible means to generate synthetic tabular data, yet existing approaches often fail to preserve key causal parameters such as the average treatment effect (ATE). In this technical exploration, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art synthetic data generators, both GAN- and LLM-based, can achieve high predictive fidelity while substantially misestimating causal effects. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid generation framework that combines model-based covariate synthesis (monitored via distance-to-closest-record filtering) with separately learned propensity and outcome models, thereby ensuring that (W, A, Y) triplets retain their underlying causal structure. We further introduce a synthetic pairing strategy to mitigate positivity violations and a realistic evaluation protocol that leverages unlimited synthetic samples to benchmark traditional estimators (IPTW, AIPW, substitution) under complex covariate distributions. This work lays the groundwork for LLM-powered data pipelines that support robust causal analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xyc-arch/llm-synthetic-for-causal-inference.git.

<title>Reject Only Critical Tokens: Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) ensures that the output matches the target model's distribution exactly. However, we argue that this distribution matching requirement is too stringent and results in unnecessarily low acceptance rates, limiting potential speedups. Instead, we advocate a reformulation of the decoding objective: the proposed decoding strategy should match the expected utility, i.e., the task-specific performance, of the target model. This perspective also aligns better with real-world use cases of LLMs, where utility (e.g., code correctness, factual accuracy) is often more important than sampling distribution. Based on this reformulation, we propose a novel decoding strategy: Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding, which rejects only those tokens that would lead to a utility drop in the final output. We refer to these critical tokens as pivot tokens. We propose a method for labeling tokens as pivotal or non-pivotal and train a lightweight classifier to detect them. This method can be viewed as a relaxed version of standard SD, which offers much higher acceptance while preserving utility. We evaluate our method across various datasets, demonstrating that we can achieve up to $2.5\times$ speedup with comparable utility. Source code is available at https://github.com/amir-zsh/PAD.

Abstract: Ensuring algorithmic fairness remains a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly as models are increasingly applied across diverse domains. While numerous fairness criteria exist, they often lack generalizability across different machine learning problems. This paper examines the connections and differences among various sparsity measures in promoting fairness and proposes a unified sparsity-based framework for evaluating algorithmic fairness. The framework aligns with existing fairness criteria and demonstrates broad applicability to a wide range of machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework as an evaluation metric through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and bias mitigation methods. This work provides a novel perspective to algorithmic fairness by framing it through the lens of sparsity and social equity, offering potential for broader impact on fairness research and applications.

Abstract: Achieving both accurate and interpretable classification of motor imagery EEG remains a key challenge in brain computer interface (BCI) research. This paper compares a transparent fuzzy reasoning approach (ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO) with a deep learning benchmark (EEGNet) using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. The ANFIS pipeline combines filter bank common spatial pattern feature extraction with fuzzy IF-THEN rules optimized via particle swarm optimization, while EEGNet learns hierarchical spatial temporal representations directly from raw EEG data. In within-subject experiments, the fuzzy neural model performed better (68.58 percent +/- 13.76 percent accuracy, kappa = 58.04 percent +/- 18.43), while in cross-subject (LOSO) tests, the deep model exhibited stronger generalization (68.20 percent +/- 12.13 percent accuracy, kappa = 57.33 percent +/- 16.22). The study provides practical guidance for selecting MI-BCI systems according to design goals: interpretability or robustness across users. Future investigations into transformer based and hybrid neuro symbolic frameworks are expected to advance transparent EEG decoding.

Abstract: The remarkable success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven advances in multimodal embeddings, yet existing models remain inherently discriminative, limiting their ability to benefit from reasoning-driven generation paradigm. In this work, we pioneer the exploration of generative embeddings, unifying embedding tasks within a generative paradigm. We propose UME-R1, a universal multimodal embedding framework consisting of a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning equips the model with reasoning capabilities and enables it to generate both discriminative and generative embeddings; a subsequent reinforcement learning enhances reasoning and further optimizes generative embedding quality. This pioneering work reveals four key insights: 1) generative embeddings unlock substantial performance gains over conventional discriminative embeddings by leveraging the powerful generative reasoning capabilities of MLLMs; 2) discriminative and generative embeddings are complementary, whose combined oracle performance far exceeding that of either alone; 3) RL can effectively enhance generative embeddings, establishing a scalable optimization paradigm.; 4) repeated sampling at inference boosts downstream task coverage (pass@k), highlighting the inference-time scalability potential of generative embeddings. Evaluated on the MMEB-V2 benchmark across 78 tasks spanning video, image, and visual documents, UME-R1 significantly outperforms conventional discriminative embedding models and offers a foundation for more interpretable, reasoning-driven generative multimodal embeddings. Our code, models, and datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/UME-R1.

<title>Enhancing Adversarial Transferability by Balancing Exploration and Exploitation with Gradient-Guided Sampling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a critical challenge to deep neural networks' robustness, particularly in transfer scenarios across different model architectures. However, the transferability of adversarial attacks faces a fundamental dilemma between Exploitation (maximizing attack potency) and Exploration (enhancing cross-model generalization). Traditional momentum-based methods over-prioritize Exploitation, i.e., higher loss maxima for attack potency but weakened generalization (narrow loss surface). Conversely, recent methods with inner-iteration sampling over-prioritize Exploration, i.e., flatter loss surfaces for cross-model generalization but weakened attack potency (suboptimal local maxima). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS), which harmonizes both objectives through guiding sampling along the gradient ascent direction to improve both sampling efficiency and stability. Specifically, based on MI-FGSM, GGS introduces inner-iteration random sampling and guides the sampling direction using the gradient from the previous inner-iteration (the sampling's magnitude is determined by a random distribution). This mechanism encourages adversarial examples to reside in balanced regions with both flatness for cross-model generalization and higher local maxima for strong attack potency. Comprehensive experiments across multiple DNN architectures and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art transfer attacks.

<title>Tree Training: Accelerating Agentic LLMs Training via Shared Prefix Reuse</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00413</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In agentic LLM scenarios, an agent's interaction process during a single rollout often exhibits branching behaviors. Due to memory retrieval and concurrent tool executions at certain decision points, the token trajectory of one task evolves into a tree-like structure rather than a linear sequence. However, current training pipelines decompose such tree-structured trajectories into separate linear segments, treating each branch as an independent sequence. As a result, shared prefixes across these branches are repeatedly recomputed during both forward and backward passes. To address this inefficiency, we propose Tree Training, a paradigm that computes each shared prefix only once and reuses its intermediate results across related branches during both forward and backward passes, substantially improving computation efficiency in large-scale agentic training. This is achieved via (i) Tree Packing, which efficiently reuses shared computations across trajectories, and (ii) Gradient Restoration, which ensures correct gradient propagation across reused prefixes. Experiments on multiple open-source models demonstrate up to 3.9x reduction in total training time, enabling more efficient agentic LLM SFT and RL training.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a flexible framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), yet conventional implementations often fail to preserve key physical invariants during long-term integration. This paper introduces a \emph{structure-preserving PINN} framework for the nonlinear Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation, a prototypical model for nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation. The proposed method embeds the conservation of mass and Hamiltonian energy directly into the loss function, ensuring physically consistent and energy-stable evolution throughout training and prediction. Unlike standard \texttt{tanh}-based PINNs~\cite{raissi2019pinn,wang2022modifiedpinn}, our approach employs sinusoidal activation functions that enhance spectral expressiveness and accurately capture the oscillatory and dispersive nature of KdV solitons. Through representative case studies -- including single-soliton propagation (shape-preserving translation), two-soliton interaction (elastic collision with phase shift), and cosine-pulse initialization (nonlinear dispersive breakup) -- the model successfully reproduces hallmark behaviors of KdV dynamics while maintaining conserved invariants. Ablation studies demonstrate that combining invariant-constrained optimization with sinusoidal feature mappings accelerates convergence, improves long-term stability, and mitigates drift without multi-stage pretraining. These results highlight that computationally efficient, invariant-aware regularization coupled with sinusoidal representations yields robust, energy-consistent PINNs for Hamiltonian partial differential equations such as the KdV equation.

Abstract: Online planning has proven effective in reinforcement learning (RL) for improving sample efficiency and final performance. However, using planning for environment interaction inevitably introduces a divergence between the collected data and the policy's actual behaviors, degrading both model learning and policy improvement. To address this, we propose BOOM (Bootstrap Off-policy with WOrld Model), a framework that tightly integrates planning and off-policy learning through a bootstrap loop: the policy initializes the planner, and the planner refines actions to bootstrap the policy through behavior alignment. This loop is supported by a jointly learned world model, which enables the planner to simulate future trajectories and provides value targets to facilitate policy improvement. The core of BOOM is a likelihood-free alignment loss that bootstraps the policy using the planner's non-parametric action distribution, combined with a soft value-weighted mechanism that prioritizes high-return behaviors and mitigates variability in the planner's action quality within the replay buffer. Experiments on the high-dimensional DeepMind Control Suite and Humanoid-Bench show that BOOM achieves state-of-the-art results in both training stability and final performance. The code is accessible at https://github.com/molumitu/BOOM_MBRL.

<title>Region-Aware Reconstruction Strategy for Pre-training fMRI Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in neuroimaging is driven by the increasing availability of large-scale and heterogeneous brain imaging datasets. Recent advances in self-supervised learning, particularly reconstruction-based objectives, have demonstrated strong potential for pretraining models that generalize effectively across diverse downstream functional MRI (fMRI) tasks. In this study, we explore region-aware reconstruction strategies for a foundation model in resting-state fMRI, moving beyond approaches that rely on random region masking. Specifically, we introduce an ROI-guided masking strategy using the Automated Anatomical Labelling Atlas (AAL3), applied directly to full 4D fMRI volumes to selectively mask semantically coherent brain regions during self-supervised pretraining. Using the ADHD-200 dataset comprising 973 subjects with resting-state fMRI scans, we show that our method achieves a 4.23% improvement in classification accuracy for distinguishing healthy controls from individuals diagnosed with ADHD, compared to conventional random masking. Region-level attribution analysis reveals that brain volumes within the limbic region and cerebellum contribute most significantly to reconstruction fidelity and model representation. Our results demonstrate that masking anatomical regions during model pretraining not only enhances interpretability but also yields more robust and discriminative representations. In future work, we plan to extend this approach by evaluating it on additional neuroimaging datasets, and developing new loss functions explicitly derived from region-aware reconstruction objectives. These directions aim to further improve the robustness and interpretability of foundation models for functional neuroimaging.

<title>Deep Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Enterprise ETL Processes with Autoencoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An anomaly detection method based on deep autoencoders is proposed to address anomalies that often occur in enterprise-level ETL data streams. The study first analyzes multiple types of anomalies in ETL processes, including delays, missing values, duplicate loading, and sudden abnormal changes, and applies data standardization and feature modeling to ensure stable and usable inputs. In the method design, the encoder-decoder structure compresses high-dimensional inputs into latent representations and reconstructs them, while reconstruction error is used to measure anomaly levels. Regularization constraints are introduced in the latent space to enhance feature sparsity and distribution learning, thereby improving robustness in complex data streams. Systematic analyses under different hyperparameter settings, environmental changes, and data characteristics show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in AUC, ACC, Precision, and Recall. The results demonstrate that the deep autoencoder-based detection mechanism can effectively capture latent distribution patterns in enterprise-level ETL data streams and accurately identify diverse anomalies, providing reliable support for enterprise data processing and intelligent analysis.

<title>Why Federated Optimization Fails to Achieve Perfect Fitting? A Theoretical Perspective on Client-Side Optima</title>

Abstract: Federated optimization is a constrained form of distributed optimization that enables training a global model without directly sharing client data. Although existing algorithms can guarantee convergence in theory and often achieve stable training in practice, the reasons behind performance degradation under data heterogeneity remain unclear. To address this gap, the main contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical perspective that explains why such degradation occurs. We introduce the assumption that heterogeneous client data lead to distinct local optima, and show that this assumption implies two key consequences: 1) the distance among clients' local optima raises the lower bound of the global objective, making perfect fitting of all client data impossible; and 2) in the final training stage, the global model oscillates within a region instead of converging to a single optimum, limiting its ability to fully fit the data. These results provide a principled explanation for performance degradation in non-iid settings, which we further validate through experiments across multiple tasks and neural network architectures.

Abstract: In this paper we present a new implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for the calibration of sensors. We propose that the VAE can be used to calibrate sensor data by training the latent space as a calibration output. We discuss this new approach and show a proof-of-concept using an existing multi-sensor gas dataset. We show the performance of the proposed calibration VAE and found that it was capable of performing as calibration model while performing as an autoencoder simultaneously. Additionally, these models have shown that they are capable of creating statistically similar outputs from both the calibration output as well as the reconstruction output to their respective truth data. We then discuss the methods of future testing and planned expansion of this work.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate reasoning method for a given query remains a key challenge in language model generation. Existing approaches typically generate multiple candidate responses and use an aggregation strategy to select the output answer, often assuming that more candidate answers yield higher accuracy. We revisit this assumption through a rigorous theoretical analysis, deriving accuracy bounds for standard aggregation methods under fixed generation distributions and candidate sizes. Building on these insights, we introduce EPIC, an Ensemble Planning with Contrastive learning framework to learn a shared representation space that captures both model reasoning abilities and query-method compatibility. EPIC incorporates our probability bounds as a regularizer in a utility-driven optimization that balances accuracy and computational cost. Experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning tasks show that EPIC consistently selects optimal reasoning methods, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Air pollution, especially the particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), has become a growing concern in recent years, primarily in urban areas. Being exposed to air pollution is linked to developing numerous health problems, like the aggravation of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disorders, lung function impairment, and even cancer or early death. Forecasting future levels of PM2.5 has become increasingly important over the past few years, as it can provide early warnings and help prevent diseases. This paper aims to design, fine-tune, test, and evaluate machine learning models for predicting future levels of PM2.5 over various time horizons. Our primary objective is to assess and compare the performance of multiple models, ranging from linear regression algorithms and ensemble-based methods to deep learning models, such as advanced recurrent neural networks and transformers, as well as large language models, on this forecasting task.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable neural networks to generate weights without relying on gradient-based optimization. However, current methods are limited by issues of over-coupling and long-horizon. The former tightly binds weight generation with task-specific objectives, thereby limiting the flexibility of the learned optimizer. The latter leads to inefficiency and low accuracy during inference, caused by the lack of local constraints. In this paper, we propose Lo-Hp, a decoupled two-stage weight generation framework that enhances flexibility through learning various optimization policies. It adopts a hybrid-policy sub-trajectory balance objective, which integrates on-policy and off-policy learning to capture local optimization policies. Theoretically, we demonstrate that learning solely local optimization policies can address the long-horizon issue while enhancing the generation of global optimal weights. In addition, we validate Lo-Hp's superior accuracy and inference efficiency in tasks that require frequent weight updates, such as transfer learning, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and large language model adaptation.

arXiv:2511.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.

Abstract: Accurate multi-horizon retail forecasts are critical for inventory and promotions. We present a novel study of weekly Walmart sales (45 stores, 2010--2012) using a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) that fuses static store identifiers with time-varying exogenous signals (holidays, CPI, fuel price, temperature). The pipeline produces 1--5-week-ahead probabilistic forecasts via Quantile Loss, yielding calibrated 90\% prediction intervals and interpretability through variable-selection networks, static enrichment, and temporal attention. On a fixed 2012 hold-out dataset, TFT achieves an RMSE of \$57.9k USD per store-week and an $R^2$ of 0.9875. Across a 5-fold chronological cross-validation, the averages are RMSE = \$64.6k USD and $R^2$ = 0.9844, outperforming the XGB, CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM baseline models. These results demonstrate practical value for inventory planning and holiday-period optimization, while maintaining model transparency.

Abstract: Activation probes are attractive monitors for AI systems due to low cost and latency, but their real-world robustness remains underexplored. We ask: What failure modes arise under realistic, black-box adversarial pressure, and how can we surface them with minimal effort? We present a lightweight black-box red-teaming procedure that wraps an off-the-shelf LLM with iterative feedback and in-context learning (ICL), and requires no fine-tuning, gradients, or architectural access. Running a case study with probes for high-stakes interactions, we show that our approach can help discover valuable insights about a SOTA probe. Our analysis uncovers interpretable brittleness patterns (e.g., legalese-induced FPs; bland procedural tone FNs) and reduced but persistent vulnerabilities under scenario-constraint attacks. These results suggest that simple prompted red-teaming scaffolding can anticipate failure patterns before deployment and might yield promising, actionable insights to harden future probes.

<title>FTT-GRU: A Hybrid Fast Temporal Transformer with GRU for Remaining Useful Life Prediction</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial machinery is essential for reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules. Existing approaches, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often struggle to model both global temporal dependencies and fine-grained degradation trends in multivariate sensor data. We propose a hybrid model, FTT-GRU, which combines a Fast Temporal Transformer (FTT) -- a lightweight Transformer variant using linearized attention via fast Fourier transform (FFT) -- with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer for sequential modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of an FTT with a GRU for RUL prediction on NASA CMAPSS, enabling simultaneous capture of global and local degradation patterns in a compact architecture. On CMAPSS FD001, FTT-GRU attains RMSE 30.76, MAE 18.97, and $R^2=0.45$, with 1.12 ms CPU latency at batch=1. Relative to the best published deep baseline (TCN--Attention), it improves RMSE by 1.16\% and MAE by 4.00\%. Training curves averaged over $k=3$ runs show smooth convergence with narrow 95\% confidence bands, and ablations (GRU-only, FTT-only) support the contribution of both components. These results demonstrate that a compact Transformer-RNN hybrid delivers accurate and efficient RUL predictions on CMAPSS, making it suitable for real-time industrial prognostics.

Abstract: Understanding probabilistic relationships among variables is crucial for analyzing complex systems. Traditional structure learning methods often require extensive observational data and incur high computational costs. Recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) for structure learning, but most treat LLMs as auxiliary tools for pre-processing or post-processing, leaving the core learning process data-driven. In this work, we propose a unified framework for Bayesian network structure discovery that places LLMs at the center, supporting both data-free and data-aware settings. In the data-free case, we introduce \textbf{PromptBN} to query LLMs with metadata and efficiently uncover valid probabilistic relationships. When observational data are available, we introduce \textbf{ReActBN}, which integrates the ReAct reasoning paradigm with structure scores such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for iterative refinement. Unlike prior methods that offload refinement to external algorithms, our framework maintains the LLM actively in the loop throughout the discovery process. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both existing LLM-based approaches and traditional data-driven algorithms, particularly in the low- or no-data scenario. Code is publicly available at {\texttt{\textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/sherryzyh/prompt2bn}}}.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of model equations is a powerful approach for understanding the behavior of dynamical systems in many scientific fields. In particular, the ability to learn mathematical models from data would benefit systems biology, where the complex nature of these systems often makes a bottom up approach to modeling unfeasible. In recent years, sparse estimation techniques have gained prominence in system identification, primarily using parametric paradigms to efficiently capture system dynamics with minimal model complexity. In particular, the Sindy algorithm has successfully used sparsity to estimate nonlinear systems by extracting from a library of functions only a few key terms needed to capture the dynamics of these systems. However, parametric models often fall short in accurately representing certain nonlinearities inherent in complex systems. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that integrates sparse parametric estimation with nonparametric techniques. It captures nonlinearities that Sindy cannot describe without requiring a priori information about their functional form. That is, without expanding the library of functions to include the one that is trying to be discovered. We illustrate our approach on several examples related to estimation of complex biological phenomena.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings advocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain visualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation framework for surgical LLM deployment.

Abstract: We present a unified, data-driven framework for quantifying and enhancing offensive momentum and scoring likelihood (expected goals, xG) in professional hockey. Leveraging a Sportlogiq dataset of 541,000 NHL event records, our end-to-end pipeline comprises five stages: (1) interpretable momentum weighting of micro-events via logistic regression; (2) nonlinear xG estimation using gradient-boosted decision trees; (3) temporal sequence modeling with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks; (4) spatial formation discovery through principal component analysis (PCA) followed by K-Means clustering on standardized player coordinates; and (5) use of an X-Learner causal inference estimator to quantify the average treatment effect (ATE) of adopting the identified "optimal" event sequences and formations. We observe an ATE of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.05-0.17, p < 1e-50), corresponding to a 15% relative gain in scoring potential. These results demonstrate that strategically structured sequences and compact formations causally elevate offensive performance. Our framework delivers real-time, actionable insights for coaches and analysts, advancing hockey analytics toward principled, causally grounded tactical optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be controlled at inference time through prompts (in-context learning) and internal activations (activation steering). Different accounts have been proposed to explain these methods, yet their common goal of controlling model behavior raises the question of whether these seemingly disparate methodologies can be seen as specific instances of a broader framework. Motivated by this, we develop a unifying, predictive account of LLM control from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, we posit that both context- and activation-based interventions impact model behavior by altering its belief in latent concepts: steering operates by changing concept priors, while in-context learning leads to an accumulation of evidence. This results in a closed-form Bayesian model that is highly predictive of LLM behavior across context- and activation-based interventions in a set of domains inspired by prior work on many-shot in-context learning. This model helps us explain prior empirical phenomena - e.g., sigmoidal learning curves as in-context evidence accumulates - while predicting novel ones - e.g., additivity of both interventions in log-belief space, which results in distinct phases such that sudden and dramatic behavioral shifts can be induced by slightly changing intervention controls. Taken together, this work offers a unified account of prompt-based and activation-based control of LLM behavior, and a methodology for empirically predicting the effects of these interventions.

Abstract: We study the adversarial Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem with sparse costs under full-information feedback. In the known transition setting, existing bounds based on Online Mirror Descent (OMD) with negative-entropy regularization scale with $\sqrt{\log S A}$, where $SA$ is the size of the state-action space. While we show that this is optimal in the worst-case, this bound fails to capture the benefits of sparsity when only a small number $M \ll SA$ of state-action pairs incur cost. In fact, we also show that the negative-entropy is inherently non-adaptive to sparsity: it provably incurs regret scaling with $\sqrt{\log S}$ on sparse problems. Instead, we propose a family of $\ell_r$-norm regularizers ($r \in (1,2)$) that adapts to the sparsity and achieves regret scaling with $\sqrt{\log M}$ instead of $\sqrt{\log SA}$. We show this is optimal via a matching lower bound, highlighting that $M$ captures the effective dimension of the problem instead of $SA$. Finally, in the unknown transition setting the benefits of sparsity are limited: we prove that even on sparse problems, the minimax regret for any learner scales polynomially with $SA$.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have relied heavily on increasingly large neural networks, raising concerns about their computational and environmental costs. This paper investigates whether simpler, sparser networks can maintain strong performance by studying Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) under extreme pruning conditions. Inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, we demonstrate that RBMs can achieve high-quality generative performance even when up to 80% of the connections are pruned before training, confirming that they contain viable sub-networks. However, our experiments reveal crucial limitations: trained networks cannot fully recover lost performance through retraining once additional pruning is applied. We identify a sharp transition above which the generative quality degrades abruptly when pruning disrupts a minimal core of essential connections. Moreover, re-trained networks remain constrained by the parameters originally learned performing worse than networks trained from scratch at equivalent sparsity levels. These results suggest that for sparse networks to work effectively, pruning should be implemented early in training rather than attempted afterwards. Our findings provide practical insights for the development of efficient neural architectures and highlight the persistent influence of initial conditions on network capabilities.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its scalability is limited by synchronization overhead. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) alleviates this issue by allowing clients to communicate independently, thereby improving wall-clock efficiency in large-scale, heterogeneous environments. However, this asynchrony introduces stale updates (client updates computed on outdated global models) that can destabilize optimization and hinder convergence. We propose FedRevive, an asynchronous FL framework that revives stale updates through data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD). FedRevive integrates parameter-space aggregation with a lightweight, server-side DFKD process that transfers knowledge from stale client models to the current global model without access to real or public data. A meta-learned generator synthesizes pseudo-samples, which enables multi-teacher distillation. A hybrid aggregation scheme that combines raw updates with DFKD updates effectively mitigates staleness while retaining the scalability of AFL. Experiments on various vision and text benchmarks show that FedRevive achieves faster training up to 32.1% and higher final accuracy up to 21.5% compared to asynchronous baselines.

<title>Sensitivity Analysis for Climate Science with Generative Flow Models</title>

Abstract: Sensitivity analysis is a cornerstone of climate science, essential for understanding phenomena ranging from storm intensity to long-term climate feedbacks. However, computing these sensitivities using traditional physical models is often prohibitively expensive in terms of both computation and development time. While modern AI-based generative models are orders of magnitude faster to evaluate, computing sensitivities with them remains a significant bottleneck. This work addresses this challenge by applying the adjoint state method for calculating gradients in generative flow models, with diffusion models as a special case. We apply this method to the cBottle generative model, an emulator of ERA5 data, to perform sensitivity analysis with respect to sea surface temperatures. Furthermore, we propose a novel gradient self-consistency check to quantitatively validate the computed sensitivities against the model's own outputs. Our results provide initial evidence that this approach can produce reliable gradients, reducing the computational cost of sensitivity analysis from weeks on a supercomputer with a physical model to hours on a GPU, thereby simplifying a critical workflow in climate science.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) improve reasoning accuracy when generating multiple candidate solutions at test time, but standard methods like Best-of-N (BoN) incur high computational cost by fully generating all branches. Self-Truncation Best-of-N (ST-BoN) mitigates this by truncating unpromising paths early, but its reliance on consistency-based heuristics is a limitation as it does not directly evaluate branch quality. We present KL-Adjusted Pruned Path Algorithm (KAPPA), an inference-time method that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence, confidence, and entropy into a principled scoring function to guide progressive pruning. By promoting diversity during exploration and selectively eliminating low-scoring branches, KAPPA maintains accuracy while substantially reducing memory and token usage. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH500 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrate that KAPPA stabilizes performance in smaller models and achieves up to ~60% reduction in peak memory and ~90% reduction in total token generation relative to BoN, with minimal impact on accuracy.

<title>Privacy-Aware Time Series Synthesis via Public Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Sharing sensitive time series data in domains such as finance, healthcare, and energy consumption, such as patient records or investment accounts, is often restricted due to privacy concerns. Privacy-aware synthetic time series generation addresses this challenge by enforcing noise during training, inherently introducing a trade-off between privacy and utility. In many cases, sensitive sequences is correlated with publicly available, non-sensitive contextual metadata (e.g., household electricity consumption may be influenced by weather conditions and electricity prices). However, existing privacy-aware data generation methods often overlook this opportunity, resulting in suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs. In this paper, we present Pub2Priv, a novel framework for generating private time series data by leveraging heterogeneous public knowledge. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism to encode public data into temporal and feature embeddings, which serve as conditional inputs for a diffusion model to generate synthetic private sequences. Additionally, we introduce a practical metric to assess privacy by evaluating the identifiability of the synthetic data. Experimental results show that Pub2Priv consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in improving the privacy-utility trade-off across finance, energy, and commodity trading domains.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) has been an established problem in the educational data mining field for decades, and it is commonly assumed that the underlying learning process be- ing modeled remains static. Given the ever-changing land- scape of online learning platforms (OLPs), we investigate how concept drift and changing student populations can im- pact student behavior within an OLP through testing model performance both within a single academic year and across multiple academic years. Four well-studied KT models were applied to five academic years of data to assess how suscep- tible KT models are to concept drift. Through our analysis, we find that all four families of KT models can exhibit de- graded performance, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) remains the most stable KT model when applied to newer data, while more complex, attention based models lose pre- dictive power significantly faster. To foster more longitu- dinal evaluations of KT models, the data used to conduct our analysis is available at https://osf.io/hvfn9/?view_ only=b936c63dfdae4b0b987a2f0d4038f72a

<title>Enhancing Heavy Rain Nowcasting with Multimodal Data: Integrating Radar and Satellite Observations</title>

Abstract: The increasing frequency of heavy rainfall events, which are a major cause of urban flooding, underscores the urgent need for accurate precipitation forecasting - particularly in urban areas where localized events often go undetected by ground-based sensors. In Germany, only 17.3% of hourly heavy rain events between 2001 and 2018 were recorded by rain gauges, highlighting the limitations of traditional monitoring systems. Radar data are another source that effectively tracks ongoing precipitation; however, forecasting the development of heavy rain using radar alone remains challenging due to the brief and unpredictable nature of such events. Our focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of fusing satellite and radar data for nowcasting. We develop a multimodal nowcasting model that combines both radar and satellite imagery for predicting precipitation at lead times of 5, 15, and 30 minutes. We demonstrate that this multimodal strategy significantly outperforms radar-only approaches. Experimental results show that integrating satellite data improves prediction accuracy, particularly for intense precipitation. The proposed model increases the Critical Success Index for heavy rain by 4% and for violent rain by 3% at a 5-minute lead time. Moreover, it maintains higher predictive skill at longer lead times, where radar-only performance declines. A qualitative analysis of the severe flooding event in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany in 2021 further illustrates the superior performance of the multimodal model. Unlike the radar-only model, which captures general precipitation patterns, the multimodal model yields more detailed and accurate forecasts for regions affected by heavy rain. This improved precision enables timely, reliable, life-saving warnings. Implementation available at https://github.com/RamaKassoumeh/Multimodal_heavy_rain

<title>Effective Series Decomposition and Components Learning for Time Series Generation</title>

Abstract: Time series generation focuses on modeling the underlying data distribution and resampling to produce authentic time series data. Key components, such as trend and seasonality, drive temporal fluctuations, yet many existing approaches fail to employ interpretative decomposition methods, limiting their ability to synthesize meaningful trend and seasonal patterns. To address this gap, we introduce Seasonal-Trend Diffusion (STDiffusion), a novel framework for multivariate time series generation that integrates diffusion probabilistic models with advanced learnable series decomposition techniques, enhancing the interpretability of the generation process. Our approach separates the trend and seasonal learning into distinct blocks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) structure captures the trend, while adaptive wavelet distillation facilitates effective multi-resolution learning of seasonal components. This decomposition improves the interpretability of the model on multiple scales. In addition, we designed a comprehensive correction mechanism aimed at ensuring that the generated components exhibit a high degree of internal consistency and preserve meaningful interrelationships with one another. Our empirical studies on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series generation tasks. Furthermore, we extend the model's application to multi-window long-sequence time series generation, which delivered reliable results and highlighted its robustness and versatility.

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems have a distinctive forward-inverse structure and are fundamental to characterizing a system's thermal response, stability, and natural modes. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a mesh-free alternative for solving such problems but are often orders of magnitude slower than classical numerical schemes. In this paper, we introduce a reformulated PINN approach that casts the search for eigenpairs as a biconvex optimization problem, enabling fast and provably convergent alternating convex search (ACS) over eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using analytically optimal updates. Numerical experiments show that PINN-ACS attains high accuracy with convergence speeds up to 500$\times$ faster than gradient-based PINN training. We release our codes at https://github.com/NeurIPS-ML4PS-2025/PINN_ACS_CODES.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.

<title>Attention Saturation and Gradient Suppression at Inflection Layers: Diagnosing and Mitigating Bottlenecks in Transformer Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00797</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Transformers often exhibit over-confidence in source patterns and difficulty in forming new target-domain patterns during fine-tuning. We formalize the mechanism of output saturation leading to gradient suppression through standard cross-entropy and softmax analysis, showing that gradient suppression at inflection layers confines adaptation to high-level recombination of existing features while preventing low-level reconstruction. We introduce a set of layer-wise diagnostic metrics -- attention entropy (saturation proxy), activation gradient norm, parameter gradient norm, and Delta-CKA under a shared PCA basis -- to identify inflection layers characterized by both low attention entropy and steep gradient decay. Building on these findings, we propose a diagnose-first, inject-light fine-tuning strategy: selectively inserting LoRA adapters at inflection layers to restore suppressed backward signals with minimal parameter overhead. Experiments on BERT-base transfer from SST-2 to Rotten Tomatoes under under-trained and over-trained source regimes reveal that over-trained initialization benefits from inflection-layer LoRA injection, while under-trained initialization suffers performance degradation. When base features are strong, unblocking inflection layers facilitates high-level compositional adaptation; when base features are weak, full-pathway unblocking is required for low-level reconstruction, as supported by joint analysis of layer-wise activation gradients and Delta-CKA dynamics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasing harmful or proprietary concepts from powerful text to image generators is an emerging safety requirement, yet current "concept erasure" techniques either collapse image quality, rely on brittle adversarial losses, or demand prohibitive retraining cycles. We trace these limitations to a myopic view of the denoising trajectories that govern diffusion based generation. We introduce EraseFlow, the first framework that casts concept unlearning as exploration in the space of denoising paths and optimizes it with GFlowNets equipped with the trajectory balance objective. By sampling entire trajectories rather than single end states, EraseFlow learns a stochastic policy that steers generation away from target concepts while preserving the model's prior. EraseFlow eliminates the need for carefully crafted reward models and by doing this, it generalizes effectively to unseen concepts and avoids hackable rewards while improving the performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that EraseFlow outperforms existing baselines and achieves an optimal trade off between performance and prior preservation.

<title>Logic-informed reinforcement learning for cross-domain optimization of large-scale cyber-physical systems</title>

arXiv:2511.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) require the joint optimization of discrete cyber actions and continuous physical parameters under stringent safety logic constraints. However, existing hierarchical approaches often compromise global optimality, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) in hybrid action spaces often relies on brittle reward penalties, masking, or shielding and struggles to guarantee constraint satisfaction. We present logic-informed reinforcement learning (LIRL), which equips standard policy-gradient algorithms with projection that maps a low-dimensional latent action onto the admissible hybrid manifold defined on-the-fly by first-order logic. This guarantees feasibility of every exploratory step without penalty tuning. Experimental evaluations have been conducted across multiple scenarios, including industrial manufacturing, electric vehicle charging stations, and traffic signal control, in all of which the proposed method outperforms existing hierarchical optimization approaches. Taking a robotic reducer assembly system in industrial manufacturing as an example, LIRL achieves a 36.47\% to 44.33\% reduction at most in the combined makespan-energy objective compared to conventional industrial hierarchical scheduling methods. Meanwhile, it consistently maintains zero constraint violations and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art hybrid-action reinforcement learning baselines. Thanks to its declarative logic-based constraint formulation, the framework can be seamlessly transferred to other domains such as smart transportation and smart grid, thereby paving the way for safe and real-time optimization in large-scale CPS.

<title>Equilibrium Policy Generalization: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cross-Graph Zero-Shot Generalization in Pursuit-Evasion Games</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00811</link>

Abstract: Equilibrium learning in adversarial games is an important topic widely examined in the fields of game theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Pursuit-evasion game (PEG), as an important class of real-world games from the fields of robotics and security, requires exponential time to be accurately solved. When the underlying graph structure varies, even the state-of-the-art RL methods require recomputation or at least fine-tuning, which can be time-consuming and impair real-time applicability. This paper proposes an Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) framework to effectively learn a generalized policy with robust cross-graph zero-shot performance. In the context of PEGs, our framework is generally applicable to both pursuer and evader sides in both no-exit and multi-exit scenarios. These two generalizability properties, to our knowledge, are the first to appear in this domain. The core idea of the EPG framework is to train an RL policy across different graph structures against the equilibrium policy for each single graph. To construct an equilibrium oracle for single-graph policies, we present a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that provably generates pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with near-optimal time complexity. To guarantee scalability with respect to pursuer number, we further extend DP and RL by designing a grouping mechanism and a sequence model for joint policy decomposition, respectively. Experimental results show that, using equilibrium guidance and a distance feature proposed for cross-graph PEG training, the EPG framework guarantees desirable zero-shot performance in various unseen real-world graphs. Besides, when trained under an equilibrium heuristic proposed for the graphs with exits, our generalized pursuer policy can even match the performance of the fine-tuned policies from the state-of-the-art PEG methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have been tremendously successful in computer vision tasks. However, their large computational, memory, and energy demands are a challenge for edge inference on FPGAs -- a field that has seen a recent surge in demand. We recognize the benefits of recent works on logic and Look Up Table (LUT) based networks, such as LogicNets, NeuraLUT, DWN, among others, in offering models that simultaneously reduce both the memory and compute footprints. However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision tasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge optimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons within the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals that a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer (MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously develop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT. Contrary to some attempts to replace each multiplication with a table lookup, our architecture utilizes a neural learning approach which natively learns the LUT functions. This approach allows for reduced model sizes, and a computational and energy-efficient inference solution for vision transformer models. Evaluating on edge-suitable workloads, we achieve accuracies of 95.5% on CIFAR-10, 78.8% on CIFAR-100, and 60.9% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets, comparable to the baseline transformer. LL-ViT eliminates over 60% of the model weights and 50% of the multiplications in the model, and achieves 1.9x energy efficiency and 1.3x lower latency over an integer quantized ViT accelerator, while also offering superior throughput against prior works at a 10.9W power budget.

Abstract: Slug formation in oil and gas pipelines poses significant challenges to operational safety and efficiency, yet existing detection approaches are often offline, require domain expertise, and lack real-time interpretability. We present an interactive application that enables end-to-end data-driven slug detection through a compact and user-friendly interface. The system integrates data exploration and labeling, configurable model training and evaluation with multiple classifiers, visualization of classification results with time-series overlays, and a real-time inference module that generates persistence-based alerts when slug events are detected. The demo supports seamless workflows from labeled CSV uploads to live inference on unseen datasets, making it lightweight, portable, and easily deployable. By combining domain-relevant analytics with novel UI/UX features such as snapshot persistence, visual labeling, and real-time alerting, our tool adds significant dissemination value as both a research prototype and a practical industrial application. The demo showcases how interactive human-in-the-loop ML systems can bridge the gap between data science methods and real-world decision-making in critical process industries, with broader applicability to time-series fault diagnosis tasks beyond oil and gas.

<title>FlexiCache: Leveraging Temporal Stability of Attention Heads for Efficient KV Cache Management</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) serving is increasingly constrained by the growing size of the key-value (KV) cache, which scales with both context length and generation length. Prior work shows that attention is dominated by a small subset of critical tokens, yet existing systems struggle to exploit this efficiently without degrading accuracy, especially in long generation. We make a key observation: the temporal stability of these critical tokens varies significantly across KV heads: some heads consistently focus on the same tokens, while others shift frequently. Building on this insight, we introduce FlexiCache, a hierarchical KV-cache management system that leverages the temporal stability of KV heads to reduce GPU memory usage and computation overhead, while preserving model accuracy. FlexiCache classifies KV heads as stable or unstable: it retains all KV-cache pages from unstable heads in GPU memory, whereas for stable heads, it keeps only the top-K pages on the GPU and offloads the rest to host memory. By exploiting temporal stability, FlexiCache performs periodic reranking for stable heads to fetch newly promoted top pages. Implemented atop vLLM, FlexiCache reduces GPU memory footprint for long-context requests by up to 70%, improves offline serving throughput by 1.38-1.55x, and lowers online token latency by 1.6-2.1x, all while maintaining accuracy in long-context, long-generation scenarios.

Abstract: LLM training is resource-intensive. Quantized training improves computational and memory efficiency but introduces quantization noise, which can hinder convergence and degrade model accuracy. Stochastic Rounding (SR) has emerged as a theoretically attractive alternative to deterministic rounding, offering unbiased gradient estimates. However, its interaction with other training factors -- especially batch size -- remains under explored. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with SR, showing that increased batch sizes can compensate for reduced precision during back-propagation. Furthermore, we show that quantizing weights and activations impacts gradient variance in distinct ways. Our experiments validate these theoretical insights.

Abstract: We propose KFCPO, a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) algorithm that combines scalable Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) based second-order policy optimization with safety-aware gradient manipulation. KFCPO leverages K-FAC to perform efficient and stable natural gradient updates by approximating the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in a layerwise, closed form manner, avoiding iterative approximation overheads. To address the tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction, we introduce a margin aware gradient manipulation mechanism that adaptively adjusts the influence of reward and cost gradients based on the agent's proximity to safety boundaries. This method blends gradients using a direction sensitive projection, eliminating harmful interference and avoiding abrupt changes caused by fixed hard thresholds. Additionally, a minibatch level KL rollback strategy is adopted to ensure trust region compliance and to prevent destabilizing policy shifts. Experiments on Safety Gymnasium using OmniSafe show that KFCPO achieves 10.3% to 50.2% higher average return across environments compared to the best baseline that respected the safety constraint, demonstrating superior balance of safety and performance.

Abstract: Explainable clustering by axis-aligned decision trees was introduced by Moshkovitz et al. (2020) and has gained considerable interest. Prior work has focused on minimizing the price of explainability for specific clustering objectives, lacking a general method to fit an explanation tree to any given clustering, without restrictions. In this work, we propose a new and generic approach to explainable clustering, based on spectral graph partitioning. With it, we design an explainable clustering algorithm that can fit an explanation tree to any given non-explainable clustering, or directly to the dataset itself. Moreover, we show that prior algorithms can also be interpreted as graph partitioning, through a generalized framework due to Trevisan (2013) wherein cuts are optimized in two graphs simultaneously. Our experiments show the favorable performance of our method compared to baselines on a range of datasets.

Abstract: Human activity recognition is challenging because sensor signals shift with context, motion, and environment; effective models must therefore remain stable as the world around them changes. We introduce a categorical symmetry-aware learning framework that captures how signals vary over time, scale, and sensor hierarchy. We build these factors into the structure of feature representations, yielding models that automatically preserve the relationships between sensors and remain stable under realistic distortions such as time shifts, amplitude drift, and device orientation changes. On the UCI Human Activity Recognition benchmark, this categorical symmetry-driven design improves out-of-distribution accuracy by approx. 46 percentage points (approx. 3.6x over the baseline), demonstrating that abstract symmetry principles can translate into concrete performance gains in everyday sensing tasks via category-equivariant representation theory.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising paradigm for energy-efficient computation, yet their theoretical foundations-especially regarding stability and robustness-remain limited compared to artificial neural networks. In this work, we study discrete-time leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) SNNs through the lens of Boolean function analysis. We focus on noise sensitivity and stability in classification tasks, quantifying how input perturbations affect outputs. Our main result shows that wide LIF-SNN classifiers are stable on average, a property explained by the concentration of their Fourier spectrum on low-frequency components. Motivated by this, we introduce the notion of spectral simplicity, which formalizes simplicity in terms of Fourier spectrum concentration and connects our analysis to the simplicity bias observed in deep networks. Within this framework, we show that random LIF-SNNs are biased toward simple functions. Experiments on trained networks confirm that these stability properties persist in practice. Together, these results provide new insights into the stability and robustness properties of SNNs.

<title>Transformers as Intrinsic Optimizers: Forward Inference through the Energy Principle</title>

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong adaptability across a wide range of tasks and have become the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their underlying mechanisms remain open for further exploration. The energy-based perspective has long provided a valuable principle for understanding neural computation. In this paper, we revisit the principle of energy as a lens to understand attention-based Transformer models. We present a unified energy-based framework which is composed of three key components: the global energy $F^*$, the energy function $E_i$ and the employed gradient descent (GD) form. Within this framework, standard softmax attention can be viewed as a special case of minimizing the Helmholtz free energy as $F^*$ using standard GD when $E_i$ takes the form of elastic potential energy, with residual connections ensuring that this optimization proceeds in an incremental manner. In addition, linear attentions can also be naturally incorporated into this framework by adjusting the corresponding energy forms. We also extend the above analysis to the multi-head setting, where the energy is defined across multiple low-dimensional subspaces. Building on this framework, we propose energy-based modifications of attention structures. Inspired by classical GD algorithms, we extend the original attention formulation based on standard GD to the momentum-based GD, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), and Newton's method variants, each inducing a corresponding new attention structure. Our experiments provide preliminary support for the potential of the energy-based framework for designing attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a leading cause of stroke and mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Wrist-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) enables non-invasive, continuous rhythm monitoring, yet suffers from significant vulnerability to motion artifacts and physiological noise. Many existing approaches rely solely on single-channel PPG and are limited to binary AF detection, often failing to capture the broader range of arrhythmias encountered in clinical settings. We introduce RhythmiNet, a residual neural network enhanced with temporal and channel attention modules that jointly leverage PPG and accelerometer (ACC) signals. The model performs three-class rhythm classification: AF, sinus rhythm (SR), and Other. To assess robustness across varying movement conditions, test data are stratified by accelerometer-based motion intensity percentiles without excluding any segments. RhythmiNet achieved a 4.3% improvement in macro-AUC over the PPG-only baseline. In addition, performance surpassed a logistic regression model based on handcrafted HRV features by 12%, highlighting the benefit of multimodal fusion and attention-based learning in noisy, real-world clinical data.

<title>The Hidden Power of Normalization: Exponential Capacity Control in Deep Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Normalization methods are fundamental components of modern deep neural networks (DNNs). Empirically, they are known to stabilize optimization dynamics and improve generalization. However, the underlying theoretical mechanism by which normalization contributes to both optimization and generalization remains largely unexplained, especially when using many normalization layers in a DNN architecture.
  In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that elucidates the role of normalization through the lens of capacity control. We prove that an unnormalized DNN can exhibit exponentially large Lipschitz constants with respect to either its parameters or inputs, implying excessive functional capacity and potential overfitting. Such bad DNNs are uncountably many. In contrast, the insertion of normalization layers provably can reduce the Lipschitz constant at an exponential rate in the number of normalization operations. This exponential reduction yields two fundamental consequences: (1) it smooths the loss landscape at an exponential rate, facilitating faster and more stable optimization; and (2) it constrains the effective capacity of the network, thereby enhancing generalization guarantees on unseen data. Our results thus offer a principled explanation for the empirical success of normalization methods in deep learning.

Abstract: Accurately evaluating model performance is crucial for deploying machine learning systems in real-world applications. Traditional methods often require a sufficiently large labeled test set to ensure a reliable evaluation. However, in many contexts, a large labeled dataset is costly and labor-intensive. Therefore, we sometimes have to do evaluation by a few labeled samples, which is theoretically challenging. Recent advances in generative models offer a promising alternative by enabling the synthesis of high-quality data. In this work, we make a systematic investigation about the use of synthetic data to estimate the test error of a trained model under limited labeled data conditions. To this end, we develop novel generalization bounds that take synthetic data into account. Those bounds suggest novel ways to optimize synthetic samples for evaluation and theoretically reveal the significant role of the generator's quality. Inspired by those bounds, we propose a theoretically grounded method to generate optimized synthetic data for model evaluation. Experimental results on simulation and tabular datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing baselines, our method achieves accurate and more reliable estimates of the test error.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of cellular microenvironments in spatiotemporal data is essential for deciphering tissue development and disease progression. While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.

arXiv:2511.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has increasingly become a focal point in research, primarily due to its ability to integrate complementary information from diverse modalities. Nevertheless, modality imbalance, stemming from factors such as insufficient data acquisition and disparities in data quality, has often been inadequately addressed. This issue is particularly prominent in biological data analysis, where datasets are frequently limited, costly to acquire, and inherently heterogeneous in quality. Conventional multimodal methodologies typically fall short in concurrently harnessing intermodal synergies and effectively resolving modality conflicts.
  In this study, we propose a novel unified framework explicitly designed to address modality imbalance by utilizing mutual information to quantify interactions between modalities. Our approach adopts a balanced multimodal learning strategy comprising two key stages: cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) and a multitask-like training paradigm. During the cross-modal KD pretraining phase, stronger modalities are leveraged to enhance the predictive capabilities of weaker modalities. Subsequently, our primary training phase employs a multitask-like learning mechanism, dynamically calibrating gradient contributions based on modality-specific performance metrics and intermodal mutual information. This approach effectively alleviates modality imbalance, thereby significantly improving overall multimodal model performance.

Abstract: In recent years, effectively modeling multivariate time series has gained significant popularity, mainly due to its wide range of applications, ranging from healthcare to financial markets and energy management. Transformers, MLPs, and linear models as the de facto backbones of modern time series models have shown promising results in single-variant and/or short-term forecasting. These models, however: (1) are permutation equivariant and so lack temporal inductive bias, being less expressive to capture the temporal dynamics; (2) are naturally designed for univariate setup, missing the inter-dependencies of temporal and variate dimensions; and/or (3) are inefficient for Long-term time series modeling. To overcome training and inference efficiency as well as the lack of temporal inductive bias, recently, linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have gained attention as an alternative to Transformer-based models. These models, however, are inherently limited to a single sequence, missing inter-variate dependencies, and can propagate errors due to their additive nature. In this paper, we present Hydra, a by-design two-headed meta in-context memory module that learns how to memorize patterns at test time by prioritizing time series patterns that are more informative about the data. Hydra uses a 2-dimensional recurrence across both time and variate at each step, which is more powerful than mixing methods. Although the 2-dimensional nature of the model makes its training recurrent and non-parallelizable, we present a new 2D-chunk-wise training algorithm that approximates the actual recurrence with $\times 10$ efficiency improvement, while maintaining the effectiveness. Our experimental results on a diverse set of tasks and datasets, including time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection show the superior performance of Hydra compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an efficient tool for optimizing black-box functions, but its theoretical guarantees typically hold in the asymptotic regime. In many critical real-world applications such as drug discovery or materials design, where each evaluation can be very costly and time-consuming, BO becomes impractical for many evaluations. In this paper, we introduce the Procedure-inFormed BO (ProfBO) algorithm, which solves black-box optimization with remarkably few function evaluations. At the heart of our algorithmic design are Markov Decision Process (MDP) priors that model optimization trajectories from related source tasks, thereby capturing procedural knowledge on efficient optimization. We embed these MDP priors into a prior-fitted neural network and employ model-agnostic meta-learning for fast adaptation to new target tasks. Experiments on real-world Covid and Cancer benchmarks and hyperparameter tuning tasks demonstrate that ProfBO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving high-quality solutions with significantly fewer evaluations, making it ready for practical deployment.

Abstract: In Symbolic Regression (SR), Genetic Programming (GP) is a popular search algorithm that delivers state-of-the-art results in term of accuracy. Its success relies on the concept of neutrality, which induces large plateaus that the search can safely navigate to more promising regions. Navigating these plateaus, while necessary, requires the computation of redundant expressions, up to 60% of the total number of evaluation, as noted in a recent study. The equality graph (e-graph) structure can compactly store and group equivalent expressions enabling us to verify if a given expression and their variations were already visited by the search, thus enabling us to avoid unnecessary computation. We propose a new search algorithm for symbolic regression called SymRegg that revolves around the e-graph structure following simple steps: perturb solutions sampled from a selection of expressions stored in the e-graph, if it generates an unvisited expression, insert it into the e-graph and generates its equivalent forms. We show that SymRegg is capable of improving the efficiency of the search, maintaining consistently accurate results across different datasets while requiring a choice of a minimalist set of hyperparameters.

Abstract: The recent surge in AI agents that autonomously communicate, collaborate with humans and use diverse tools has unlocked promising opportunities in various real-world settings. However, a vital aspect remains underexplored: how agents handle data. Scalable autonomy demands agents that continuously acquire, process, and evolve their data. In this paper, we argue that data-savvy capabilities should be a top priority in the design of agentic systems to ensure reliable real-world deployment. Specifically, we propose four key capabilities to realize this vision: (1) Proactive data acquisition: enabling agents to autonomously gather task-critical knowledge or solicit human input to address data gaps; (2) Sophisticated data processing: requiring context-aware and flexible handling of diverse data challenges and inputs; (3) Interactive test data synthesis: shifting from static benchmarks to dynamically generated interactive test data for agent evaluation; and (4) Continual adaptation: empowering agents to iteratively refine their data and background knowledge to adapt to shifting environments. While current agent research predominantly emphasizes reasoning, we hope to inspire a reflection on the role of data-savvy agents as the next frontier in data-centric AI.

Abstract: This study develops a SARIMAX-based prediction system for short-term power outage forecasting during extreme weather events. Using hourly data from Michigan counties with outage counts and comprehensive weather features, we implement a systematic two-stage feature engineering pipeline: data cleaning to remove zero-variance and unknown features, followed by correlation-based filtering to eliminate highly correlated predictors. The selected features are augmented with temporal embeddings, multi-scale lag features, and weather variables with their corresponding lags as exogenous inputs to the SARIMAX model. To address data irregularity and numerical instability, we apply standardization and implement a hierarchical fitting strategy with sequential optimization methods, automatic downgrading to ARIMA when convergence fails, and historical mean-based fallback predictions as a final safeguard. The model is optimized separately for short-term (24 hours) and medium-term (48 hours) forecast horizons using RMSE as the evaluation metric. Our approach achieves an RMSE of 177.2, representing an 8.4\% improvement over the baseline method (RMSE = 193.4), thereby validating the effectiveness of our feature engineering and robust optimization strategy for extreme weather-related outage prediction.

Abstract: Synthetic healthcare data generation presents a viable approach to enhance data accessibility and support research by overcoming limitations associated with real-world medical datasets. However, ensuring fairness across protected attributes in synthetic data is critical to avoid biased or misleading results in clinical research and decision-making. In this study, we assess the fairness of synthetic data generated by multiple generative adversarial network (GAN)-based models using the MIMIC-III dataset, with a focus on representativeness across protected demographic attributes. We measure subgroup representation using the logarithmic disparity metric and observe significant imbalances, with many subgroups either underrepresented or overrepresented in the synthetic data, compared to the real data. To mitigate these disparities, we introduce MedEqualizer, a model-agnostic augmentation framework that enriches the underrepresented subgroups prior to synthetic data generation. Our results show that MedEqualizer significantly improves demographic balance in the resulting synthetic datasets, offering a viable path towards more equitable and representative healthcare data synthesis.

Abstract: Cognitive workload is a topic of increasing interest across various fields such as health, psychology, and defense applications. In this research, we focus on classifying cognitive workload using the COLET dataset, employing a window-based approach for feature generation and machine/deep learning techniques for classification. We apply window-based temporal partitioning to enhance features used in existing research, followed by machine learning and deep learning models to classify different levels of cognitive workload. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly tabular architectures, outperformed traditional machine learning methods in precision, F1-score, accuracy, and classification precision. This study highlights the effectiveness of window-based temporal feature extraction and the potential of deep learning techniques for real-time cognitive workload assessment in complex and dynamic tasks.

Abstract: The long-held assumption that backpropagation (BP) is essential for state-of-the-art performance is challenged by this work. We present rigorous, hardware-validated evidence that the Mono-Forward (MF) algorithm, a backpropagation-free method, consistently surpasses an optimally tuned BP baseline in classification accuracy on its native Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. This superior generalization is achieved with profound efficiency gains, including up to 41% less energy consumption and up to 34% faster training. Our analysis, which charts an evolutionary path from Geoffrey Hinton's Forward-Forward (FF) to the Cascaded Forward (CaFo) and finally to MF, is grounded in a fair comparative framework using identical architectures and universal hyperparameter optimization. We further provide a critical re-evaluation of memory efficiency in BP-free methods, empirically demonstrating that practical overhead can offset theoretical gains. Ultimately, this work establishes MF as a practical, high-performance, and sustainable alternative to BP for MLPs.

Bycapturingfairness through this intuitive lens, we not only offer a more human-centered approach, but also one that is mathematically rigorous: In order to compute the optimal, fair post-processing strategy, only a linear program needs to be solved. This makes our method both efficient and scalable with existing optimization tools. Furthermore, it unifies and extends several well-known fairness definitions, and our em- pirical results highlight its practical strengths across diverse scenarios.

<title>AI Progress Should Be Measured by Capability-Per-Resource, Not Scale Alone: A Framework for Gradient-Guided Resource Allocation in LLMs</title>

arXiv:2511.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper challenges the "scaling fundamentalism" dominating AI research, where unbounded growth in model size and computation has led to unsustainable environmental impacts and widening resource inequality. We argue that LLM development should be fundamentally reoriented toward capability-per-resource rather than capability alone. We present a theoretical framework demonstrating that resource-allocation decisions guided by gradient influence patterns can dramatically improve efficiency throughout the AI lifecycle. Our analysis shows that in transformer-based models, where a small fraction of parameters exert outsized influence (following heavy-tailed distributions), three critical insights emerge: (1) updating only high-influence parameters strictly outperforms full-parameter tuning on a performance-per-resource basis; (2) simple gradient norms provide computationally efficient proxies for identifying these high-influence components; and (3) coordinated parameter and data selection yields multiplicative efficiency gains, potentially reducing resource requirements by orders of magnitude. Building on these theoretical foundations, we propose a two stage paradigm marginal-return pretraining for foundation developers and influence guided adaptation for downstream users bridged by gradient blueprints, metadata describing which parameters matter most for various tasks. This capability-per-resource perspective transforms what were once considered pragmatic hardware workarounds into theoretically optimal strategies, democratizing access to cutting-edge AI capabilities while significantly reducing environmental impact. By embedding resource consciousness into how we develop, adapt, and evaluate models, we can reshape AI progress toward a more sustainable and equitable future.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) methods have traditionally focused on mitigating catastrophic forgetting through gradient-based retraining, an approach ill-suited for deployed agents that must adapt in real time. We introduce our Adaptive Teaching and Learning System (ATLAS), a dual-agent architecture that decouples reasoning (Teacher) from execution (Student) and incorporates a persistent learning memory that stores distilled guidance from experience. This informs the orchestration layer, enabling the system to dynamically adjust its operational strategies, such as supervision level or initial plan selection, at inference time. In doing so, ATLAS achieves gradient-free continual learning, shifting the locus of adaptation from model parameters to system-level orchestration. We formulate this as a system-centric paradigm for continual learning, where the objective is adaptive efficiency: maximizing task success while minimizing computational cost through inference-time orchestration rather than parameter updates. Evaluated on Microsoft's ExCyTIn-Bench, an open-source benchmark simulating complex cyberthreat investigation, ATLAS achieves 54.1% success with GPT-5-mini as its Student, outperforming the larger GPT-5 (High) by 13% while reducing cost by 86%. Cross-incident validation demonstrates generalization: frozen pamphlets from Incident #5 improve accuracy from 28% to 41% with zero retraining, while shifting output composition from verbose exploration to structured reasoning. Together, these findings establish gradient-free continual learning as a viable path toward adaptive, deployable AI systems and provide causally annotated traces valuable for training explicit world models.

Our first main result shows that the solution operator associated with a broad range of $2$BSDE families is approximable by appropriate neural operator models. We then identify a structured subclass of (infinite) families of $2$BSDEs whose neural operator approximation requires only a polynomial number of parameters in the reciprocal approximation rate, as opposed to the exponential requirement in general worst-case neural operator guarantees.

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) is a powerful framework for machine learning problems where both outer and inner objectives evolve over time, requiring dynamic updates. Current OBO approaches rely on deterministic \textit{window-smoothed} regret minimization, which may not accurately reflect system performance when functions change rapidly. In this work, we introduce a novel search direction and show that both first- and zeroth-order (ZO) stochastic OBO algorithms leveraging this direction achieve sublinear {stochastic bilevel regret without window smoothing}. Beyond these guarantees, our framework enhances efficiency by: (i) reducing oracle dependence in hypergradient estimation, (ii) updating inner and outer variables alongside the linear system solution, and (iii) employing ZO-based estimation of Hessians, Jacobians, and gradients. Experiments on online parametric loss tuning and black-box adversarial attacks validate our approach.

<title>Regularization Implies balancedness in the deep linear network</title>

Abstract: We use geometric invariant theory (GIT) to study the deep linear network (DLN). The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map.
  This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.

<title>Adapt under Attack and Domain Shift: Unified Adversarial Meta-Learning and Domain Adaptation for Robust Automatic Modulation Classification</title>

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a leading approach for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, vulnerability to adversarial attacks and susceptibility to data distribution shifts hinder their practical deployment in real-world, dynamic environments. To address these threats, we propose a novel, unified framework that integrates meta-learning with domain adaptation, making AMC systems resistant to both adversarial attacks and environmental changes. Our framework utilizes a two-phase strategy. First, in an offline phase, we employ a meta-learning approach to train the model on clean and adversarially perturbed samples from a single source domain. This method enables the model to generalize its defense, making it resistant to a combination of previously unseen attacks. Subsequently, in the online phase, we apply domain adaptation to align the model's features with a new target domain, allowing it to adapt without requiring substantial labeled data. As a result, our framework achieves a significant improvement in modulation classification accuracy against these combined threats, offering a critical solution to the deployment and operational challenges of modern AMC systems.

Abstract: Uplift modeling has emerged as a crucial technique for individualized treatment effect estimation, particularly in fields such as marketing and healthcare. Modeling uplift effects in multi-treatment scenarios plays a key role in real-world applications. Current techniques for modeling multi-treatment uplift are typically adapted from binary-treatment works. In this paper, we investigate and categorize all current model adaptations into two types: Structure Adaptation and Feature Adaptation. Through our empirical experiments, we find that these two adaptation types cannot maintain effectiveness under various data characteristics (noisy data, mixed with observational data, etc.). To enhance estimation ability and robustness, we propose Orthogonal Function Adaptation (OFA) based on the function approximation theorem. We conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple data characteristics to study the effectiveness and robustness of all model adaptation techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed OFA can significantly improve uplift model performance compared to other vanilla adaptation methods and exhibits the highest robustness.

Abstract: It has been shown that the chain of thought (CoT) can enhance the power of large language models (LLMs) to solve certain mathematical reasoning problems. However, the capacity of CoT is still not fully explored. As an important instance, the following basic question has not yet been answered: Does CoT expand the capability of transformers across all reasoning tasks? We demonstrate that reasoning with transformers is essentially a memorization problem for reasoning datasets. Thus, examining the power of CoT across all reasoning tasks amounts to analyzing the memorization capabilities of CoT transformers. In this paper, we give a complete description of the memorization capabilities of fixed-precision transformers with or without CoT and give a negative answer to the above-mentioned question. Precisely, we first give necessary and sufficient conditions for fixed-precision transformers with and without CoT to memorize a finite reasoning dataset and show that these two conditions do not imply each other. Then, we give lower and upper bounds for the number of parameters needed for transformers with or without CoT to memorize a finite reasoning dataset with $N$ elements, which are $\overline{\Theta}(N)$ in all cases. This implies that there exist reasoning tasks for which CoT does not enhance the reasoning power of transformers, leading to a negative answer to the above-mentioned question. Finally, we give the first results on memorizing infinite reasoning datasets by CoT transformers and show that some simple infinite datasets cannot be memorized by transformers with or without CoT.

Abstract: As spectrum sharing becomes increasingly vital to meet rising wireless demands in the future, spectrum monitoring and transmitter identification are indispensable for enforcing spectrum usage policy, efficient spectrum utilization, and net- work security. This study proposed a robust framework for transmitter identification and protocol categorization via multi- task RF signal classification in shared spectrum environments, where the spectrum monitor will classify transmission protocols (e.g., 4G LTE, 5G-NR, IEEE 802.11a) operating within the same frequency bands, and identify different transmitting base stations, as well as their combinations. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to tackle critical challenges such as overlapping signal characteristics and environmental variability. The proposed method employs a multi-channel input strategy to extract meaningful signal features, achieving remarkable accuracy: 90% for protocol classification, 100% for transmitting base station classification, and 92% for joint classification tasks, utilizing RF data from the POWDER platform. These results highlight the significant potential of the proposed method to enhance spectrum monitoring, management, and security in modern wireless networks.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the associated dollar costs of API calls can fluctuate over time, potentially invalidating conclusions drawn in prior research. To address this, we propose a Fair Evaluation protocol for Test-Time Compute (FEval-TTC), designed to ensure consistent assessment of test-time compute (TTC) methods, regardless of such fluctuations. FEval-TTC focuses on the evaluation of TTC methods that utilize underlying Chains-of-Thought (CoT). It supports evaluations across multiple LLMs on a diverse set of mathematical and commonsense reasoning datasets. The few-shot prompting and answer extraction processes are standardized across datasets, reducing both time and monetary overhead for researchers. Furthermore, we provide a cost modelling procedure that estimates both the token and dollar cost per query, facilitating equitable comparisons of prevalent TTC methods. We open-source FEval-TTC for public use at https://github.com/networkslab/feval_ttc .

<title>Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement Using Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Simulations</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates the strategic placement of charging stations to optimize resource utilization and minimize user inconvenience. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers an innovative approach to identifying optimal charging station locations; however, existing methods face challenges due to their deterministic reward systems, which limit efficiency. Because real-world conditions are dynamic and uncertain, a deterministic reward structure cannot fully capture the complexities of charging station placement. As a result, evaluation becomes costly and time-consuming, and less reflective of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates deep RL with agent-based simulations to model EV movement and estimate charging demand in real time. Our approach employs a hybrid RL agent with dual Q-networks to select optimal locations and configure charging ports, guided by a hybrid reward function that combines deterministic factors with simulation-derived feedback. Case studies in Hanoi, Vietnam, show that our method reduces average waiting times by 53.28% compared to the initial state, outperforming static baseline methods. This scalable and adaptive solution enhances EV infrastructure planning, effectively addressing real-world complexities and improving user experience.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wind loading on buildings is crucial for structural safety and sustainable design, yet conventional approaches such as wind tunnel testing and large-eddy simulation (LES) are prohibitively expensive for large-scale exploration. Each LES case typically requires at least 24 hours of computation, making comprehensive parametric studies infeasible. We introduce WindMiL, a new machine learning framework that combines systematic dataset generation with symmetry-aware graph neural networks (GNNs). First, we introduce a large-scale dataset of wind loads on low-rise buildings by applying signed distance function interpolation to roof geometries and simulating 462 cases with LES across varying shapes and wind directions. Second, we develop a reflection-equivariant GNN that guarantees physically consistent predictions under mirrored geometries. Across interpolation and extrapolation evaluations, WindMiL achieves high accuracy for both the mean and the standard deviation of surface pressure coefficients (e.g., RMSE $\leq 0.02$ for mean $C_p$) and remains accurate under reflected-test evaluation, maintaining hit rates above $96\%$ where the non-equivariant baseline model drops by more than $10\%$. By pairing a systematic dataset with an equivariant surrogate, WindMiL enables efficient, scalable, and accurate predictions of wind loads on buildings.

<title>A Saddle Point Remedy: Power of Variable Elimination in Non-convex Optimization</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of saddle points, rather than poor local minima, is increasingly understood to be a primary obstacle in large-scale non-convex optimization for machine learning. Variable elimination algorithms, like Variable Projection (VarPro), have long been observed to exhibit superior convergence and robustness in practice, yet a principled understanding of why they so effectively navigate these complex energy landscapes has remained elusive. In this work, we provide a rigorous geometric explanation by comparing the optimization landscapes of the original and reduced formulations. Through a rigorous analysis based on Hessian inertia and the Schur complement, we prove that variable elimination fundamentally reshapes the critical point structure of the objective function, revealing that local maxima in the reduced landscape are created from, and correspond directly to, saddle points in the original formulation. Our findings are illustrated on the canonical problem of non-convex matrix factorization, visualized directly on two-parameter neural networks, and finally validated in training deep Residual Networks, where our approach yields dramatic improvements in stability and convergence to superior minima. This work goes beyond explaining an existing method; it establishes landscape simplification via saddle point transformation as a powerful principle that can guide the design of a new generation of more robust and efficient optimization algorithms.

<title>KAT-GNN: A Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network for Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records</title>

Abstract: Clinical risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs) is vital to facilitate timely interventions and clinical decision support. However, modeling heterogeneous and irregular temporal EHR data presents significant challenges. We propose \textbf{KAT-GNN} (Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network), a graph-based framework that integrates clinical knowledge and temporal dynamics for risk prediction. KAT-GNN first constructs modality-specific patient graphs from EHRs. These graphs are then augmented using two knowledge sources: (1) ontology-driven edges derived from SNOMED CT and (2) co-occurrence priors extracted from EHRs. Subsequently, a time-aware transformer is employed to capture longitudinal dynamics from the graph-encoded patient representations. KAT-GNN is evaluated on three distinct datasets and tasks: coronary artery disease (CAD) prediction using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) and in-hospital mortality prediction using the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets. KAT-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD prediction (AUROC: 0.9269 $\pm$ 0.0029) and demonstrated strong results in mortality prediction in MIMIC-III (AUROC: 0.9230 $\pm$ 0.0070) and MIMIC-IV (AUROC: 0.8849 $\pm$ 0.0089), consistently outperforming established baselines such as GRASP and RETAIN. Ablation studies confirm that both knowledge-based augmentation and the temporal modeling component are significant contributors to performance gains. These findings demonstrate that the integration of clinical knowledge into graph representations, coupled with a time-aware attention mechanism, provides an effective and generalizable approach for risk prediction across diverse clinical tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However, traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.

<title>Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Networks for Epileptic Seizure Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Forecasting epileptic seizures from multivariate EEG signals represents a critical challenge in healthcare time series prediction, requiring high sensitivity, low false alarm rates, and subject-specific adaptability. We present STAN, an Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Network that jointly models spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics through cascaded attention blocks with alternating spatial and temporal modules. Unlike existing approaches that assume fixed preictal durations or separately process spatial and temporal features, STAN captures bidirectional dependencies between spatial and temporal patterns through a unified cascaded architecture. Adversarial training with gradient penalty enables robust discrimination between interictal and preictal states learned from clearly defined 15-minute preictal windows. Continuous 90-minute pre-seizure monitoring reveals that the learned spatio-temporal attention patterns enable early detection: reliable alarms trigger at subject-specific times (typically 15-45 minutes before onset), reflecting the model's capacity to capture subtle preictal dynamics without requiring individualized training. Experiments on two benchmark EEG datasets (CHB-MIT scalp: 8 subjects, 46 events; MSSM intracranial: 4 subjects, 14 events) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: 96.6% sensitivity with 0.011 false detections per hour and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063 false detections per hour, respectively, while maintaining computational efficiency (2.3M parameters, 45 ms latency, 180 MB memory) for real-time edge deployment. Beyond epilepsy, the proposed framework provides a general paradigm for spatio-temporal forecasting in healthcare and other time series domains where individual heterogeneity and interpretability are crucial.

Abstract: Nanopore protein sequencing produces long, noisy ionic current traces in which key molecular phases, such as protein capture and translocation, are embedded. Capture phases mark the successful entry of a protein into the pore and serve as both a checkpoint and a signal that a channel merits further analysis. However, manual identification of capture phases is time-intensive, often requiring several days for expert reviewers to annotate the data due to the need for domain-specific interpretation of complex signal patterns. To address this, a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was developed and trained to detect capture phases in down-sampled signal windows. Evaluated against CNN-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) hybrids, histogram-based classifiers, and other CNN variants using run-level data splits, our best model, CaptureNet-Deep, achieved an F1 score of 0.94 and precision of 93.39% on held-out test data. The model supports low-latency inference and is integrated into a dashboard for Oxford Nanopore experiments, reducing the total analysis time from several days to under thirty minutes. These results show that efficient, real-time capture detection is possible using simple, interpretable architectures and suggest a broader role for lightweight ML models in sequencing workflows.

Abstract: Finding a control Lyapunov function (CLF) in a dynamical system with a controller is an effective way to guarantee stability, which is a crucial issue in safety-concerned applications. Recently, deep learning models representing CLFs have been applied into a learner-verifier framework to identify satisfiable candidates. However, the learner treats Lyapunov conditions as complex constraints for optimisation, which is hard to achieve global convergence. It is also too complicated to implement these Lyapunov conditions for verification. To improve this framework, we treat Lyapunov conditions as inductive biases and design a neural CLF and a CLF-based controller guided by this knowledge. This design enables a stable optimisation process with limited constraints, and allows end-to-end learning of both the CLF and the controller. Our approach achieves a higher convergence rate and larger region of attraction (ROA) in learning the CLF compared to existing methods among abundant experiment cases. We also thoroughly reveal why the success rate decreases with previous methods during learning.

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) to communication systems is expected to play a pivotal role in future artificial intelligence (AI)-based next-generation wireless networks. While most existing works focus on ML techniques for static wireless environments, they often face limitations when applied to highly dynamic environments, such as flying ad hoc networks (FANETs). This paper explores the use of data-driven Koopman approaches to address these challenges. Specifically, we investigate how these approaches can model UAV trajectory dynamics within FANETs, enabling more accurate predictions and improved network performance. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we propose two possible approaches -- centralized and distributed -- to efficiently address the challenges posed by the constantly changing topology of FANETs. To demonstrate this, we consider a FANET performing surveillance with UAVs following pre-determined trajectories and predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) to ensure reliable communication between UAVs. Our results show that these approaches can accurately predict connectivity and isolation events that lead to modelled communication outages. This capability could help UAVs schedule their transmissions based on these predictions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed nodes without exposing raw data, but its decentralized nature makes it vulnerable in trust-deficient environments. Inference attacks may recover sensitive information from gradient updates, while poisoning attacks can degrade model performance or induce malicious behaviors. Existing defenses often suffer from high communication and computation costs, or limited detection precision. To address these issues, we propose LSHFed, a robust and communication-efficient FL framework that simultaneously enhances aggregation robustness and privacy preservation. At its core, LSHFed incorporates LSHGM, a novel gradient verification mechanism that projects high-dimensional gradients into compact binary representations via multi-hyperplane locally-sensitive hashing. This enables accurate detection and filtering of malicious gradients using only their irreversible hash forms, thus mitigating privacy leakage risks and substantially reducing transmission overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSHFed maintains high model performance even when up to 50% of participants are collusive adversaries while achieving up to a 1000x reduction in gradient verification communication compared to full-gradient methods.

Abstract: The placement of Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) across the Cloud-Continuum represents a core challenge in the orchestration of current 5G and future 6G networks. The process involves the placement of interdependent computing tasks, structured as Service Function Chains, over distributed cloud infrastructures. This is achieved while satisfying strict resource, bandwidth and latency constraints. It is acknowledged that classical approaches, including mixed-integer nonlinear programming, heuristics and reinforcement learning are limited in terms of scalability, constraint handling and generalisation capacity. In the present study, a novel theoretical framework is proposed, which is based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for CNF placement. The present approach proposes a reconceptualisation of placement as a generative graph to assignment task, where the placement problem is encoded as a heterogeneous graph, and a Graph Neural Network denoiser is trained to iteratively refine noisy CNF-to-cloud assignment matrices. The model incorporates constraint-specific losses directly into the loss function, thereby allowing it to learn feasible solution spaces. The integration of the DDPM formulation with structured combinatorial constraints is achieved through a rigorous and systematic approach. Extensive evaluations across diverse topologies have been conducted, which have confirmed that the model consistently produces feasible solutions with orders of magnitude faster inference than MINLP solvers. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based generative modelling for constrained network embedding problems, making an impact towards the practical, scalable orchestration of distributed Cloud-Native Network Functions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new algorithm, MiniFool, that implements physics-inspired adversarial attacks for testing neural network-based classification tasks in particle and astroparticle physics. While we initially developed the algorithm for the search for astrophysical tau neutrinos with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we apply it to further data from other science domains, thus demonstrating its general applicability. Here, we apply the algorithm to the well-known MNIST data set and furthermore, to Open Data data from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The algorithm is based on minimizing a cost function that combines a $\chi^2$ based test-statistic with the deviation from the desired target score. The test statistic quantifies the probability of the perturbations applied to the data based on the experimental uncertainties. For our studied use cases, we find that the likelihood of a flipped classification differs for both the initially correctly and incorrectly classified events. When testing changes of the classifications as a function of an attack parameter that scales the experimental uncertainties, the robustness of the network decision can be quantified. Furthermore, this allows testing the robustness of the classification of unlabeled experimental data.

Abstract: Split learning is an approach to collaborative learning in which a deep neural network is divided into two parts: client-side and server-side at a cut layer. The client side executes its model using its raw input data and sends the intermediate activation to the server side. This configuration architecture is very useful for enabling collaborative training when data or resources are separated between devices. However, split learning lacks the ability to verify the correctness and honesty of the computations that are performed and exchanged between the parties. To this purpose, this paper proposes a verifiable split learning framework that integrates a zk-SNARK proof to ensure correctness and verifiability. The zk-SNARK proof and verification are generated for both sides in forward propagation and backward propagation on the server side, guaranteeing verifiability on both sides. The verifiable split learning architecture is compared to a blockchain-enabled system for the same deep learning network, one that records updates but without generating the zero-knowledge proof. From the comparison, it can be deduced that applying the zk-SNARK test achieves verifiability and correctness, while blockchains are lightweight but unverifiable.

Abstract: Traditional continuous deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ deterministic or unimodal Gaussian actors, which cannot express complex multimodal decision distributions. This limitation can hinder their performance in diversity-critical scenarios. There have been some attempts to design online multimodal RL algorithms based on diffusion or amortized actors. However, these actors are intractable, making existing methods struggle with balancing performance, decision diversity, and efficiency simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we first reformulate existing intractable multimodal actors within a unified framework, and prove that they can be directly optimized by policy gradient via reparameterization. Then, we propose a distance-based diversity regularization that does not explicitly require decision probabilities. We identify two diversity-critical domains, namely multi-goal achieving and generative RL, to demonstrate the advantages of multimodal policies and our method, particularly in terms of few-shot robustness. In conventional MuJoCo benchmarks, our algorithm also shows competitive performance. Moreover, our experiments highlight that the amortized actor is a promising policy model class with strong multimodal expressivity and high performance.

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool for building predictive models. However, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attacks are a common type of adversarial attack that adds small perturbations to input data to trick a model into misclassifying it. In response to these attacks, researchers have developed methods for "unlearning" these attacks, which involves retraining a model on the original data without the added perturbations. Machine unlearning is a technique that tries to "forget" specific data points from the training dataset, to improve the robustness of a machine learning model against adversarial attacks like FGSM. In this paper, we focus on applying unlearning techniques to the LeNet neural network, a popular architecture for image classification. We evaluate the efficacy of unlearning FGSM attacks on the LeNet network and find that it can significantly improve its robustness against these types of attacks.

Abstract: Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are widely used to reduce memory and computational costs in deep learning. However, existing implementations, including standard FFT and real FFT (rFFT), cannot achieve true in-place computation. In particular, rFFT maps an input of size n to a complex output of size n/2+1, causing dimensional mismatch and requiring additional memory allocation. We propose the first real-domain, fully in-place FFT framework (rdFFT) that preserves input-output memory space consistency. By leveraging butterfly operation symmetry and conjugate properties in the frequency domain, we design an implicit complex encoding scheme that eliminates intermediate cache usage entirely. Experiments on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate the method effectiveness in reducing training memory cost, offering a promising direction for frequency-domain lightweight adaptation.

<title>Leveraging Compact Satellite Embeddings and Graph Neural Networks for Large-Scale Poverty Mapping</title>

Abstract: Accurate, fine-grained poverty maps remain scarce across much of the Global South. While Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provide high-quality socioeconomic data, their spatial coverage is limited and reported coordinates are randomly displaced for privacy, further reducing their quality. We propose a graph-based approach leveraging low-dimensional AlphaEarth satellite embeddings to predict cluster-level wealth indices across Sub-Saharan Africa. By modeling spatial relations between surveyed and unlabeled locations, and by introducing a probabilistic "fuzzy label" loss to account for coordinate displacement, we improve the generalization of wealth predictions beyond existing surveys. Our experiments on 37 DHS datasets (2017-2023) show that incorporating graph structure slightly improves accuracy compared to "image-only" baselines, demonstrating the potential of compact EO embeddings for large-scale socioeconomic mapping.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL), widely used in privacy-critical applications, suffers from limited interpretability, whereas Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) address this limitation via learnable spline functions. However, existing FL studies applying KAN overlook the communication overhead introduced by grid extension, which is essential for modeling complex functions. In this letter, we propose CG-FKAN, which compresses extended grids by sparsifying and transmitting only essential coefficients under a communication budget. Experiments show that CG-FKAN achieves up to 13.6% lower RMSE than fixed-grid KAN in communication-constrained settings. In addition, we derive a theoretical upper bound on its approximation error.

<title>The Curvature Rate {\lambda}: A Scalar Measure of Input-Space Sharpness in Neural Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01438</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01438</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvature influences generalization, robustness, and how reliably neural networks respond to small input perturbations. Existing sharpness metrics are typically defined in parameter space (e.g., Hessian eigenvalues) and can be expensive, sensitive to reparameterization, and difficult to interpret in functional terms. We introduce a scalar curvature measure defined directly in input space: the curvature rate {\lambda}, given by the exponential growth rate of higher-order input derivatives. Empirically, {\lambda} is estimated as the slope of log ||D^n f|| versus n for small n. This growth-rate perspective unifies classical analytic quantities: for analytic functions, {\lambda} corresponds to the inverse radius of convergence, and for bandlimited signals, it reflects the spectral cutoff. The same principle extends to neural networks, where {\lambda} tracks the emergence of high-frequency structure in the decision boundary. Experiments on analytic functions and neural networks (Two Moons and MNIST) show that {\lambda} evolves predictably during training and can be directly shaped using a simple derivative-based regularizer, Curvature Rate Regularization (CRR). Compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), CRR achieves similar accuracy while yielding flatter input-space geometry and improved confidence calibration. By grounding curvature in differentiation dynamics, {\lambda} provides a compact, interpretable, and parameterization-invariant descriptor of functional smoothness in learned models.

Abstract: Graph curvature provides geometric priors for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enhancing their ability to model complex graph structures, particularly in terms of structural awareness, robustness, and theoretical interpretability. Among existing methods, Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been extensively studied due to its strong geometric interpretability, effectively characterizing the local geometric distribution between nodes. However, its prohibitively high computational complexity limits its applicability to large-scale graph datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel graph curvature measure--Effective Resistance Curvature--which quantifies the ease of message passing along graph edges using the effective resistance between node pairs, instead of the optimal transport distance. This method significantly outperforms Ollivier-Ricci curvature in computational efficiency while preserving comparable geometric expressiveness. Theoretically, we prove the low computational complexity of effective resistance curvature and establish its substitutability for Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Furthermore, extensive experiments on diverse GNN tasks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with Ollivier-Ricci curvature while drastically reducing computational overhead.

<title>DAMBench: A Multi-Modal Benchmark for Deep Learning-based Atmospheric Data Assimilation</title>

Abstract: Data Assimilation is a cornerstone of atmospheric system modeling, tasked with reconstructing system states by integrating sparse, noisy observations with prior estimation. While traditional approaches like variational and ensemble Kalman filtering have proven effective, recent advances in deep learning offer more scalable, efficient, and flexible alternatives better suited for complex, real-world data assimilation involving large-scale and multi-modal observations. However, existing deep learning-based DA research suffers from two critical limitations: (1) reliance on oversimplified scenarios with synthetically perturbed observations, and (2) the absence of standardized benchmarks for fair model comparison. To address these gaps, in this work, we introduce DAMBench, the first large-scale multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate data-driven DA models under realistic atmospheric conditions. DAMBench integrates high-quality background states from state-of-the-art forecasting systems and real-world multi-modal observations (i.e., real-world weather stations and satellite imagery). All data are resampled to a common grid and temporally aligned to support systematic training, validation, and testing. We provide unified evaluation protocols and benchmark representative data assimilation approaches, including latent generative models and neural process frameworks. Additionally, we propose a lightweight multi-modal plugin to demonstrate how integrating realistic observations can enhance even simple baselines. Through comprehensive experiments, DAMBench establishes a rigorous foundation for future research, promoting reproducibility, fair comparison, and extensibility to real-world multi-modal scenarios. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/figerhaowang/DAMBench.

Abstract: AI systems on edge devices face a critical challenge in open-world environments: adapting when data distributions shift and novel classes emerge. While offline training dominates current paradigms, online continual learning (OCL)--where models learn incrementally from non-stationary streams without catastrophic forgetting--remains challenging in power-constrained settings. We present a neuromorphic solution called CLP-SNN: a spiking neural network architecture for Continually Learning Prototypes and its implementation on Intel's Loihi 2 chip. Our approach introduces three innovations: (1) event-driven and spatiotemporally sparse local learning, (2) a self-normalizing three-factor learning rule maintaining weight normalization, and (3) integrated neurogenesis and metaplasticity for capacity expansion and forgetting mitigation. On OpenLORIS few-shot learning experiments, CLP-SNN achieves accuracy competitive with replay methods while being rehearsal-free. CLP-SNN delivers transformative efficiency gains: 70\times faster (0.33ms vs 23.2ms), and 5,600\times more energy efficient (0.05mJ vs 281mJ) than the best alternative OCL on edge GPU. This demonstrates that co-designed brain-inspired algorithms and neuromorphic hardware can break traditional accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for future edge AI systems.

Abstract: Accurately predicting stock market movements remains a formidable challenge due to the inherent volatility and complex interdependencies among stocks. Although multi-scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) hold potential for modeling these relationships, they frequently neglect two key points: the subtle intra-attribute patterns within each stock affecting inter-stock correlation, and the biased attention to coarse- and fine-grained features during multi-scale sampling. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MS-HGFN (Multi-Scale Hierarchical Graph Fusion Network). The model features a hierarchical GNN module that forms dynamic graphs by learning patterns from intra-attributes and features from inter-attributes over different time scales, thus comprehensively capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, a top-down gating approach facilitates the integration of multi-scale spatio-temporal features, preserving critical coarse- and fine-grained features without too much interference. Experiments utilizing real-world datasets from U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrate that MS-HGFN outperforms both traditional and advanced models, yielding up to a 1.4% improvement in prediction accuracy and enhanced stability in return simulations. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MS-HGFN.

Abstract: Time series classification holds broad application value in communications, information countermeasures, finance, and medicine. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods-including HIVE-COTE, Proximity Forest, and TS-CHIEF-exhibit high computational complexity, coupled with lengthy parameter tuning and training cycles. In contrast, lightweight solutions like ROCKET (Random Convolutional Kernel Transform) offer greater efficiency but leave substantial room for improvement in kernel selection and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a feature extraction approach based on Hadamard convolutional transform, utilizing column or row vectors of Hadamard matrices as convolution kernels with extended lengths of varying sizes. This enhancement maintains full compatibility with existing methods (e.g., ROCKET) while leveraging kernel orthogonality to boost computational efficiency, robustness, and adaptability. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain datasets-focusing on the UCR time series dataset-demonstrate SOTA performance: F1-score improved by at least 5% vs. ROCKET, with 50% shorter training time than miniROCKET (fastest ROCKET variant) under identical hyperparameters, enabling deployment on ultra-low-power embedded devices.

<title>Explore More, Learn Better: Parallel MLLM Embeddings under Mutual Information Minimization</title>

Abstract: Embedding models are a cornerstone of modern AI. Driven by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have made great progress in architecture and data curation, while the holistic paradigm is still limited to SSC, i.e., single input, singular embedding, contrastive supervision, which collapses rich, multifaceted inputs into monolithic embeddings and fails to fully exploit MLLM capabilities. In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF) for multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of MLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response under explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone on distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one input, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote full parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an explicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain semantic alignment. Such dual-objectives force PDF to yield robust semantic coverage and a generalizable embedding space. Ultimately, the remarkable embedding space are accessible at inference via one single forward pass, incurring negligible computational overhead. We instantiate PDF on multiple MLLM backbones and prove its effectiveness on MMEB benchmark. Significant gains are consistently achieved across various resolutions and model sizes, e.g., boosting the VLM2Vec-LLaVA-1.6-LR model by a remarkable +8.9% (7B), while the VLM2Vec-Qwen2VL models by +4.2% (2B) and +3.1% (7B). In terms of efficiency, our 2B model surpasses its baseline by +2.6% using only half the computational budget.

<title>Defining Energy Indicators for Impact Identification on Aerospace Composites: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Perspective</title>

Abstract: Energy estimation is critical to impact identification on aerospace composites, where low-velocity impacts can induce internal damage that is undetectable at the surface. Current methodologies for energy prediction are often constrained by data sparsity, signal noise, complex feature interdependencies, non-linear dynamics, massive design spaces, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. This study introduces a physics-informed framework that embeds domain knowledge into machine learning through a dedicated input space. The approach combines observational biases, which guide the design of physics-motivated features, with targeted feature selection to retain only the most informative indicators. Features are extracted from time, frequency, and time-frequency domains to capture complementary aspects of the structural response. A structured feature selection process integrating statistical significance, correlation filtering, dimensionality reduction, and noise robustness ensures physical relevance and interpretability. Exploratory data analysis further reveals domain-specific trends, yielding a reduced feature set that captures essential dynamic phenomena such as amplitude scaling, spectral redistribution, and transient signal behaviour. Together, these steps produce a compact set of energy-sensitive indicators with both statistical robustness and physical significance, resulting in impact energy predictions that remain interpretable and traceable to measurable structural responses. Using this optimised input space, a fully-connected neural network is trained and validated with experimental data from multiple impact scenarios, including pristine and damaged states. The resulting model demonstrates significantly improved impact energy prediction accuracy, reducing errors by a factor of three compared to conventional time-series techniques and purely data-driven models.

<title>Estimation of Toeplitz Covariance Matrices using Overparameterized Gradient Descent</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider covariance estimation under Toeplitz structure. Numerous sophisticated optimization methods have been developed to maximize the Gaussian log-likelihood under Toeplitz constraints. In contrast, recent advances in deep learning demonstrate the surprising power of simple gradient descent (GD) applied to overparameterized models. Motivated by this trend, we revisit Toeplitz covariance estimation through the lens of overparameterized GD. We model the $P\times P$ covariance as a sum of $K$ complex sinusoids with learnable parameters and optimize them via GD. We show that when $K = P$, GD may converge to suboptimal solutions. However, mild overparameterization ($K = 2P$ or $4P$) consistently enables global convergence from random initializations. We further propose an accelerated GD variant with separate learning rates for amplitudes and frequencies. When frequencies are fixed and only amplitudes are optimized, we prove that the optimization landscape is asymptotically benign and any stationary point recovers the true covariance. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that overparameterized GD can match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods in challenging settings, while remaining simple and scalable.

arXiv:2511.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Chain-of-Thought (Graph-CoT) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform step-by-step reasoning over graph-structured knowledge, but existing pipelines suffer from low accuracy, excessive token usage, high latency, and low throughput due to single-agent monolithic prompts, repeated context re-encoding, and inefficient serving execution. We present GLM, the first multi-agent Graph-CoT system co-designed with an optimized LLM serving architecture. GLM decomposes reasoning into specialized agents for classification, reasoning, action generation, and graph retrieval, enabling branching and selective context sharing to reduce prompt length and reasoning iterations while preserving reasoning quality, thereby improving accuracy and reducing overall token consumption. To scale inference, we introduce a Graph-CoT-aware LLM inference mechanism with graph-specific KV-cache management, priority-based eviction, and pipelined execution to improve serving efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that GLM improves answer accuracy by up to 38%, reduces token cost by up to 95.7%, lowers inference latency by 90.3%, and achieves up to 15.1x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art Graph-CoT baselines, enabling efficient adoption for complex real-world reasoning at scale.

arXiv:2511.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual causal inference faces significant challenges when extended to multi-category, multi-valued treatments, where complex cross-effects between heterogeneous interventions are difficult to model. Existing methodologies remain constrained to binary or single-type treatments and suffer from restrictive assumptions, limited scalability, and inadequate evaluation frameworks for complex intervention scenarios.
  We present XTNet, a novel network architecture for multi-category, multi-valued treatment effect estimation. Our approach introduces a cross-effect estimation module with dynamic masking mechanisms to capture treatment interactions without restrictive structural assumptions. The architecture employs a decomposition strategy separating basic effects from cross-treatment interactions, enabling efficient modeling of combinatorial treatment spaces. We also propose MCMV-AUCC, a suitable evaluation metric that accounts for treatment costs and interaction effects. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that XTNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both ranking accuracy and effect estimation quality. The results of the real-world A/B test further confirm its effectiveness.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, have established new benchmarks in multimodal data mining. In such models, few-shot fine-tuning is a major challenge to achieve optimal performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, especially when labeled data is scarce. Most existing fine-tuning approaches rely on first-order gradient-based optimizers, which typically suffer from slow convergence, sensitivity to step-size hyperparameters, and poor generalization in OOD settings. In contrast, second-order methods utilize local curvature information of the loss landscape to adjust the update step size. This is particularly beneficial for CLIP models, whose non-convex loss functions often contain sharp critical points. In such cases, natural gradient direction can offer more substantial and efficient per-iteration updates when fine-tuning with limited data. Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) is obtained by preconditioning the standard gradient with the inverse Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which is computationally expensive for large models. To address this, we propose a Bayesian approximation of NGD using a Kalman filter for CLIP models. Our method combines the benefits of second-order optimization with Bayesian inference, which enhances generalization while providing uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse image classification datasets demonstrate that our algorithm consistently achieves superior--or comparable--ID performance and improved OOD robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful application of Kalman filtering to fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which enables more robust and efficient learning in vision-language tasks.

arXiv:2511.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for edge intelligence, enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy across distributed personal devices. However, the inherent volatility of edge environments, characterized by dynamic resource availability and heterogeneous client capabilities, poses significant challenges for achieving high accuracy and fairness in client participation. This paper investigates the fundamental trade-off between model accuracy and fairness in highly volatile edge environments. This paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of fairness-based client selection algorithms such as RBFF and RBCSF against random and greedy client selection regarding fairness, model performance, and time, in three benchmarking datasets (CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and EMNIST). This work aims to shed light on the fairness-performance and fairness-speed trade-offs in a volatile edge environment and explore potential future research opportunities to address existing pitfalls in \textit{fair client selection} strategies in FL. Our results indicate that more equitable client selection algorithms, while providing a marginally better opportunity among clients, can result in slower global training in volatile environments\footnote{The code for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/obaidullahzaland/FairFL_FLTA.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in distributed learning arises from the difficulty of handling heterogeneous local models and data. In light of the recent success of generative models, we propose to meet this challenge by building on the idea of exchanging synthetic data instead of sharing model parameters. Local models can then be treated as ``black boxes'' with the ability to learn their parameters from data and to generate data according to these parameters. Moreover, if the local models admit semi-supervised learning, we can extend the approach by enabling local models on different probability spaces. This allows to handle heterogeneous data with different modalities. We formulate the learning of the local models as a cooperative game starting from the principles of game theory. We prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium for exponential family local models and show that the proposed learning approach converges to this equilibrium. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on standard benchmark vision datasets for image classification and conditional generation.

Abstract: Quantum computing requires effective error correction strategies to mitigate noise and decoherence. Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising solution for scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) applications by supporting constant-rate encoding and a sparse parity-check structure. However, decoding QLDPC codes via traditional approaches such as Belief Propagation (BP) suffers from poor convergence in the presence of short cycles. Machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize learned message passing over their node features; however, they are restricted to pairwise interactions on Tanner graphs, which limits their ability to capture higher-order correlations. In this work, we propose HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)- based QLDPC decoder that captures higher-order stabilizer constraints by utilizing hyperedges-thus enabling highly expressive and compact decoding. We use a two-stage message passing scheme and evaluate the decoder over the pseudo-threshold region. Below the pseudo-threshold mark, HyperNQ improves the Logical Error Rate (LER) up to 84% over BP and 50% over GNN-based strategies, demonstrating enhanced performance over the existing state-of-the-art decoders.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are driving significant innovations in mobile edge computing within next-generation wireless networks. However, the substantial demands for computational resources and large-scale training data required to train LAMs conflict with the limited storage and computational capacity of edge devices, posing significant challenges to training and deploying LAMs at the edge. In this work, we introduce the Networked Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE) system, in which clients infer collaboratively by distributing tasks to suitable neighbors based on their expertise and aggregate the returned results. For training the NMoE, we propose a federated learning framework that integrates both supervised and self-supervised learning to balance personalization and generalization, while preserving communication efficiency and data privacy. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed NMoE system, providing insights and benchmarks for the NMoE training algorithms.

Abstract: Battery safety is critical in applications ranging from consumer electronics to electric vehicles and aircraft, where undetected anomalies could trigger safety hazards or costly downtime. In this study, we present OSBAD as an open-source benchmark for anomaly detection frameworks in battery applications. By benchmarking 15 diverse algorithms encompassing statistical, distance-based, and unsupervised machine-learning methods, OSBAD enables a systematic comparison of anomaly detection methods across heterogeneous datasets. In addition, we demonstrate how a physics- and statistics-informed feature transformation workflow enhances anomaly separability by decomposing collective anomalies into point anomalies. To address a major bottleneck in unsupervised anomaly detection due to incomplete labels, we propose a Bayesian optimization pipeline that facilitates automated hyperparameter tuning based on transfer-learning and regression proxies. Through validation on datasets covering both liquid and solid-state chemistries, we further demonstrate the cross-chemistry generalization capability of OSBAD to identify irregularities across different electrochemical systems. By making benchmarking database with open-source reproducible anomaly detection workflows available to the community, OSBAD establishes a unified foundation for developing safe, scalable, and transferable anomaly detection tools in battery analytics. This research underscores the significance of physics- and statistics-informed feature engineering as well as model selection with probabilistic hyperparameter tuning, in advancing trustworthy, data-driven diagnostics for safety-critical energy systems.

<title>RLAC: Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic for Free-Form Generation Tasks</title>

Abstract: Open-ended generation tasks require outputs to satisfy diverse and often implicit task-specific evaluation rubrics. The sheer number of relevant rubrics leads to prohibitively high verification costs and incomplete assessments of a response, making reinforcement learning (RL) post-training with rubric-based rewards difficult to scale. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that often the best way to combine these rubrics into one single reward is also highly prompt-specific. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic (RLAC), a post-training approach that addresses these challenges via dynamic rubric verification. Our approach employs a large language model (LLM) as a critic that dynamically identifies only the most likely failure modes (e.g., a factual error or unhandled edge case), which are then verified by an external validator to optimize both generator and critic jointly. By training both the generator and the critic, this game enhances the critic's error detection and the generator's output quality while reducing required verifications. Our experiments demonstrate that RLAC improves factual accuracy in text generation and correctness in code generation, while also outperforming exhaustive verification and reward model methods. We show that dynamic critics are more effective than fixed critics, showcasing the potential of RLAC for scaling RL post-training to free-form generation tasks.

Abstract: When fine-tuning language models on new tasks, catastrophic forgetting -- performance degradation on previously-learned tasks -- is a ubiquitous problem. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA address this through low-rank adapters, sparse adaptation offers an alternative that doesn't impose rank constraints. We introduce Random Initialization of Gated Sparse Adapters (RIGSA), which starts from randomly-initialized full-rank adapters, gates them with a ReZero analog, and sparsifies them with iterative magnitude pruning. We evaluate RIGSA on SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct using a novel vision-in-text task (Textual MNIST) and measure forgetting on PIQA, HellaSwag, and GSM8k. SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct initially performs around chance level on Textual MNIST, and is capable of learning the task through RIGSA, 4-bit QLoRA and random masking. In spite of having more trainable parameters than QLoRA, the RIGSA configurations that we studied displayed less forgetting than QLoRA, particularly on GSM8k, though it performs comparably to random masking.

Abstract: We present Fractional Diffusion Bridge Models (FDBM), a novel generative diffusion bridge framework driven by an approximation of the rich and non-Markovian fractional Brownian motion (fBM). Real stochastic processes exhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range dependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured in standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion (BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM), we construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the non-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving generative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from paired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data translation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein conformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation. In both settings, FDBM achieves superior performance compared to the Brownian baselines, yielding lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of C$_\alpha$ atomic positions in protein structure prediction and lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) in unpaired image translation.

Abstract: In a distributed machine learning setting like Federated Learning where there are multiple clients involved which update their individual weights to a single central server, often training on the entire individual client's dataset for each client becomes cumbersome. To address this issue we propose $\methodprop$: a personalized coreset weighted federated learning setup where the training updates for each individual clients are forwarded to the central server based on only individual client coreset based representative data points instead of the entire client data. Through theoretical analysis we present how the average generalization error is minimax optimal up to logarithm bounds (upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(n_k^{-\frac{2 \beta}{2 \beta+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}} \log ^{2 \delta^{\prime}}(n_k))$) and lower bounds of $\mathcal{O}(n_k^{-\frac{2 \beta}{2 \beta+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}})$, and how the overall generalization error on the data likelihood differs from a vanilla Federated Learning setup as a closed form function ${\boldsymbol{\Im}}(\boldsymbol{w}, n_k)$ of the coreset weights $\boldsymbol{w}$ and coreset sample size $n_k$. Our experiments on different benchmark datasets based on a variety of recent personalized federated learning architectures show significant gains as compared to random sampling on the training data followed by federated learning, thereby indicating how intelligently selecting such training samples can help in performance. Additionally, through experiments on medical datasets our proposed method showcases some gains as compared to other submodular optimization based approaches used for subset selection on client's data.

Abstract: Blood flow is sensitive to disease and provides insight into cardiac function, making flow field analysis valuable for diagnosis. However, while safer than radiation-based imaging and more suitable for patients with medical implants, ultrasound suffers from attenuation with depth, limiting the quality of the image. Despite advances in echocardiographic particle image velocimetry (EchoPIV), accurately measuring blood velocity remains challenging due to the technique's limitations and the complexity of blood flow dynamics. Physics-informed machine learning can enhance accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios where noisy or incomplete data challenge purely data-driven approaches. We present a physics-informed neural field model with multi-scale Fourier Feature encoding for estimating blood flow from sparse and noisy ultrasound data without requiring ground truth supervision. We demonstrate that this model achieves consistently low mean squared error in denoising and inpainting both synthetic and real datasets, verified against reference flow fields and ground truth flow rate measurements. While physics-informed neural fields have been widely used to reconstruct medical images, applications to medical flow reconstruction are mostly prominent in Flow MRI. In this work, we adapt methods that have proven effective in other imaging modalities to address the specific challenge of ultrasound-based flow reconstruction.

<title>No-rank Tensor Decomposition Using Metric Learning</title>

Abstract: Tensor decomposition faces fundamental challenges in analyzing high-dimensional data, where traditional methods based on reconstruction and fixed-rank constraints often fail to capture semantically meaningful structures. This paper introduces a no-rank tensor decomposition framework grounded in metric learning, which replaces reconstruction objectives with a discriminative, similarity-based optimization. The proposed approach learns data-driven embeddings by optimizing a triplet loss with diversity and uniformity regularization, creating a feature space where distance directly reflects semantic similarity. We provide theoretical guarantees for the framework's convergence and establish bounds on its metric properties. Evaluations across diverse domains --including face recognition (LFW, Olivetti), brain connectivity analysis (ABIDE), and simulated data (galaxy morphology, crystal structures)-- demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline techniques, including PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and tensor decomposition baselines (CP and Tucker). Results show substantial improvements in clustering metrics (Silhouette Score, Davies--Bouldin Index, Calinski--Harabasz Index, Separation Ratio, Adjusted Rand Index, Normalized Mutual Information) and reveal a fundamental trade-off: while metric learning optimizes global class separation, it deliberately transforms local geometry to align with semantic relationships. Crucially, our approach achieves superior performance with smaller training datasets compared to transformer-based methods, offering an efficient alternative for domains with limited labeled data. This work establishes metric learning as a paradigm for tensor-based analysis, prioritizing semantic relevance over pixel-level fidelity while providing computational advantages in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization delivers centimeter-scale accuracy but is vulnerable to jamming attacks, creating security risks for asset tracking and intrusion detection in smart buildings. Although machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have improved tag localization, localizing malicious jammers within a single room and across changing indoor layouts remains largely unexplored. Two novel UWB datasets, collected under original and modified room configurations, are introduced to establish comprehensive ML/DL baselines. Performance is rigorously evaluated using a variety of classification and regression metrics. On the source dataset with the collected UWB features, Random Forest achieves the highest F1-macro score of 0.95 and XGBoost achieves the lowest mean Euclidean error of 20.16 cm. However, deploying these source-trained models in the modified room layout led to severe performance degradation, with XGBoost's mean Euclidean error increasing tenfold to 207.99 cm, demonstrating significant domain shift. To mitigate this degradation, a domain-adversarial ConvNeXt autoencoder (A-CNT) is proposed that leverages a gradient-reversal layer to align CIR-derived features across domains. The A-CNT framework restores localization performance by reducing the mean Euclidean error to 34.67 cm. This represents a 77 percent improvement over non-adversarial transfer learning and an 83 percent improvement over the best baseline, restoring the fraction of samples within 30 cm to 0.56. Overall, the results demonstrate that adversarial feature alignment enables robust and transferable indoor jammer localization despite environmental changes.

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how model performance grows with data, parameters and compute. While large datasets can usually be collected at relatively low cost in domains such as language or vision, scientific machine learning is often limited by the high expense of generating training data through numerical simulations. However, by adjusting modeling assumptions and approximations, simulation fidelity can be traded for computational cost, an aspect absent in other domains. We investigate this trade-off between data fidelity and cost in neural surrogates using low- and high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. Reformulating classical scaling laws, we decompose the dataset axis into compute budget and dataset composition. Our experiments reveal compute-performance scaling behavior and exhibit budget-dependent optimal fidelity mixes for the given dataset configuration. These findings provide the first study of empirical scaling laws for multi-fidelity neural surrogate datasets and offer practical considerations for compute-efficient dataset generation in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when sequentially fine-tuned on new tasks, degrading performance on previously learned foundational and task-specific capabilities. While multi-task learning can mitigate forgetting, it requires simultaneous access to all datasets and imposes computational overhead that scales linearly with the number of tasks. In this work, we introduce a routing-based approach that enables the integration of new tasks while preserving the foundational knowledge acquired during pretraining. We evaluate our method using InternVL-2 models (2B and 8B parameters) and demonstrate that routing preserves the model's foundational capabilities by maintaining performance on general-purpose benchmarks such as ChartQA, MMBench, and DocVQA, while simultaneously improving accuracy on specialized tasks. Importantly, our approach achieves this without requiring concurrent access to data from all tasks, avoiding the significant computational and data overhead associated with traditional multi-task learning. We further conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the scalability and robustness of routing-based learning, showing that the approach is resilient to a growing number of tasks and performs particularly well when new tasks are semantically related. Finally, we show that the routing mechanism enables superior cross-modal transfer between language and vision capabilities, allowing knowledge learned in one modality to enhance performance in another capability not achieved by existing continual learning methods.

<title>Priors in Time: Missing Inductive Biases for Language Model Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Recovering meaningful concepts from language model activations is a central aim of interpretability. While existing feature extraction methods aim to identify concepts that are independent directions, it is unclear if this assumption can capture the rich temporal structure of language. Specifically, via a Bayesian lens, we demonstrate that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) impose priors that assume independence of concepts across time, implying stationarity. Meanwhile, language model representations exhibit rich temporal dynamics, including systematic growth in conceptual dimensionality, context-dependent correlations, and pronounced non-stationarity, in direct conflict with the priors of SAEs. Taking inspiration from computational neuroscience, we introduce a new interpretability objective -- Temporal Feature Analysis -- which possesses a temporal inductive bias to decompose representations at a given time into two parts: a predictable component, which can be inferred from the context, and a residual component, which captures novel information unexplained by the context. Temporal Feature Analyzers correctly parse garden path sentences, identify event boundaries, and more broadly delineate abstract, slow-moving information from novel, fast-moving information, while existing SAEs show significant pitfalls in all the above tasks. Overall, our results underscore the need for inductive biases that match the data in designing robust interpretability tools.

<title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Reservoir Water Temperatures in the U.S. Red River Basin of the South</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Reservoir Water Temperature (RWT) is vital for sustainable water management, ecosystem health, and climate resilience. Yet, prediction alone offers limited insight into the governing physical processes. To bridge this gap, we integrated explainable machine learning (ML) with symbolic modeling to uncover the drivers of RWT dynamics across ten reservoirs in the Red River Basin, USA, using over 10,000 depth-resolved temperature profiles. We first employed ensemble and neural models, including Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), achieving high predictive skill (best RMSE = 1.20 degree Celsius, R^2 = 0.97). Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we quantified the contribution of physical drivers such as air temperature, depth, wind, and lake volume, revealing consistent patterns across reservoirs. To translate these data-driven insights into compact analytical expressions, we developed Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) to symbolically approximate RWT. Ten progressively complex KAN equations were derived, improving from R^2 = 0.84 using a single predictor (7-day antecedent air temperature) to R^2 = 0.92 with ten predictors, though gains diminished beyond five, highlighting a balance between simplicity and accuracy. The resulting equations, dominated by linear and rational forms, incrementally captured nonlinear behavior while preserving interpretability. Depth consistently emerged as a secondary but critical predictor, whereas precipitation had limited effect. By coupling predictive accuracy with explanatory power, this framework demonstrates how KANs and explainable ML can transform black-box models into transparent surrogates that advance both prediction and understanding of reservoir thermal dynamics.

Abstract: In lifelong learning, a learner faces a sequence of tasks with shared structure and aims to identify and leverage it to accelerate learning. We study the setting where such structure is captured by a common representation of data. Unlike multi-task learning or learning-to-learn, where tasks are available upfront to learn the representation, lifelong learning requires the learner to make use of its existing knowledge while continually gathering partial information in an online fashion. In this paper, we consider a generalized framework of lifelong representation learning. We propose a simple algorithm that uses multi-task empirical risk minimization as a subroutine and establish a sample complexity bound based on a new notion we introduce--the task-eluder dimension. Our result applies to a wide range of learning problems involving general function classes. As concrete examples, we instantiate our result on classification and regression tasks under noise.

Abstract: Near the critical point, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of lattice quantum field theories (LQFT) become increasingly inefficient due to critical slowing down. In this work, we investigate score-based symmetry-preserving diffusion models as an alternative strategy to sample two-dimensional $\phi^4$ and ${\rm U}(1)$ lattice field theories. We develop score networks that are equivariant to a range of group transformations, including global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflections, local ${\rm U}(1)$ rotations, and periodic translations $\mathbb{T}$. The score networks are trained using an augmented training scheme, which significantly improves sample quality in the simulated field theories. We also demonstrate empirically that our symmetry-aware models outperform generic score networks in sample quality, expressivity, and effective sample size.

<title>Matrix Phylogeny: Compact Spectral Fingerprints for Trap-Robust Preconditioner Selection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Matrix Phylogeny introduces compact spectral fingerprints (CSF/ASF) that characterize matrices at the family level. These fingerprints are low-dimensional, eigendecomposition-free descriptors built from Chebyshev trace moments estimated by Hutchinson sketches. A simple affine rescaling to [-1,1] makes them permutation/similarity invariant and robust to global scaling.
  Across synthetic and real tests, we observe phylogenetic compactness: only a few moments are needed. CSF with K=3-5 already yields perfect clustering (ARI=1.0; silhouettes ~0.89) on four synthetic families and a five-family set including BA vs ER, while ASF adapts the dimension on demand (median K*~9). On a SuiteSparse mini-benchmark (Hutchinson p~100), both CSF-H and ASF-H reach ARI=1.0. Against strong alternatives (eigenvalue histograms + Wasserstein, heat-kernel traces, WL-subtree), CSF-K=5 matches or exceeds accuracy while avoiding eigendecompositions and using far fewer features (K<=10 vs 64/9153).
  The descriptors are stable to noise (log-log slope ~1.03, R^2~0.993) and support a practical trap->recommend pipeline for automated preconditioner selection. In an adversarial E6+ setting with a probe-and-switch mechanism, our physics-guided recommender attains near-oracle iteration counts (p90 regret=0), whereas a Frobenius 1-NN baseline exhibits large spikes (p90~34-60).
  CSF/ASF deliver compact (K<=10), fast, invariant fingerprints that enable scalable, structure-aware search and recommendation over large matrix repositories. We recommend CSF with K=5 by default, and ASF when domain-specific adaptivity is desired.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for predicting cognitive age using psychophysiological tests. To determine cognitive age, subjects were asked to complete a series of psychological tests measuring various cognitive functions, including reaction time and cognitive conflict, short-term memory, verbal functions, and color and spatial perception. Based on the tests completed, the average completion time, proportion of correct answers, average absolute delta of the color campimetry test, number of guessed words in the M\"unsterberg matrix, and other parameters were calculated for each subject. The obtained characteristics of the subjects were preprocessed and used to train a machine learning algorithm implementing a regression task for predicting a person's cognitive age. These findings contribute to the field of remote screening using mobile devices for human health for diagnosing and monitoring cognitive aging.

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) hosts the world's largest longitudinal dataset of climate-related survey responses, combining structured indicators with open-ended narratives, but the heterogeneity and free-form nature of these disclosures present significant analytical challenges for benchmarking, compliance monitoring, and investment screening. This paper proposes a novel decision-support framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to assess corporate climate disclosure quality at scale. It develops a master rubric that harmonizes narrative scoring across 11 years of CDP data (2010-2020), enabling cross-sector and cross-country benchmarking. By integrating rubric-guided scoring with percentile-based normalization, our method identifies temporal trends, strategic alignment patterns, and inconsistencies in disclosure across industries and regions. Results reveal that sectors such as technology and countries like Germany consistently demonstrate higher rubric alignment, while others exhibit volatility or superficial engagement, offering insights that inform key decision-making processes for investors, regulators, and corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategists. The proposed LLM-based approach transforms unstructured disclosures into quantifiable, interpretable, comparable, and actionable intelligence, advancing the capabilities of AI-enabled decision support systems (DSSs) in the domain of climate governance.

<title>On the Structure of Floating-Point Noise in Batch-Invariant GPU Matrix Multiplication</title>

Abstract: Floating-point non-associativity makes fundamental deep learning operations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul) on GPUs, inherently non-deterministic. Despite this, the statistical structure of the resulting numerical error remains poorly understood. A common working assumption is that these errors behave as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise. In this paper, we empirically test this assumption and show that it fails to describe real GPU behavior. By comparing outputs of single-input and batched matmuls, we find that while the i.i.d. model predicts non-zero output instability, empirical results show a 0.00% prediction flip rate. Through covariance analysis, we uncover the cause: the floating-point error is structured and highly correlated. For float16, nearly 50% of the total error variance lies in off-diagonal terms, revealing that the noise behaves as a coordinated, directional perturbation rather than random static. This result challenges the prevailing stochastic view of numerical noise and provides a principled foundation for analyzing deep learning reliability under hardware non-determinism.

<title>Position Paper: If Innovation in AI Systematically Violates Fundamental Rights, Is It Innovation at All?</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) now permeates critical infrastructures and decision-making systems where failures produce social, economic, and democratic harm. This position paper challenges the entrenched belief that regulation and innovation are opposites. As evidenced by analogies from aviation, pharmaceuticals, and welfare systems and recent cases of synthetic misinformation, bias and unaccountable decision-making, the absence of well-designed regulation has already created immeasurable damage. Regulation, when thoughtful and adaptive, is not a brake on innovation--it is its foundation. The present position paper examines the EU AI Act as a model of risk-based, responsibility-driven regulation that addresses the Collingridge Dilemma: acting early enough to prevent harm, yet flexibly enough to sustain innovation. Its adaptive mechanisms--regulatory sandboxes, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) support, real-world testing, fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA) -- demonstrate how regulation can accelerate responsibly, rather than delay, technological progress. The position paper summarises how governance tools transform perceived burdens into tangible advantages: legal certainty, consumer trust, and ethical competitiveness. Ultimately, the paper reframes progress: innovation and regulation advance together. By embedding transparency, impact assessments, accountability, and AI literacy into design and deployment, the EU framework defines what responsible innovation truly means--technological ambition disciplined by democratic values and fundamental rights.

<title>On the Fundamental Limitations of Decentralized Learnable Reward Shaping in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in learnable reward shaping have shown promise in single-agent reinforcement learning by automatically discovering effective feedback signals. However, the effectiveness of decentralized learnable reward shaping in cooperative multi-agent settings remains poorly understood. We propose DMARL-RSA, a fully decentralized system where each agent learns individual reward shaping, and evaluate it on cooperative navigation tasks in the simple_spread_v3 environment. Despite sophisticated reward learning, DMARL-RSA achieves only -24.20 +/- 0.09 average reward, compared to MAPPO with centralized training at 1.92 +/- 0.87--a 26.12-point gap. DMARL-RSA performs similarly to simple independent learning (IPPO: -23.19 +/- 0.96), indicating that advanced reward shaping cannot overcome fundamental decentralized coordination limitations. Interestingly, decentralized methods achieve higher landmark coverage (0.888 +/- 0.029 for DMARL-RSA, 0.960 +/- 0.045 for IPPO out of 3 total) but worse overall performance than centralized MAPPO (0.273 +/- 0.008 landmark coverage)--revealing a coordination paradox between local optimization and global performance. Analysis identifies three critical barriers: (1) non-stationarity from concurrent policy updates, (2) exponential credit assignment complexity, and (3) misalignment between individual reward optimization and global objectives. These results establish empirical limits for decentralized reward learning and underscore the necessity of centralized coordination for effective multi-agent cooperation.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing in retail requires policies that adapt to shifting demand while coordinating decisions across related products. We present a systematic empirical study of multi-agent reinforcement learning for retail price optimization, comparing a strong MAPPO baseline with a graph-attention-augmented variant (MAPPO+GAT) that leverages learned interactions among products. Using a simulated pricing environment derived from real transaction data, we evaluate profit, stability across random seeds, fairness across products, and training efficiency under a standardized evaluation protocol. The results indicate that MAPPO provides a robust and reproducible foundation for portfolio-level price control, and that MAPPO+GAT further enhances performance by sharing information over the product graph without inducing excessive price volatility. These results indicate that graph-integrated MARL provides a more scalable and stable solution than independent learners for dynamic retail pricing, offering practical advantages in multi-product decision-making.

Abstract: We introduce [Cosmos-Predict2.5], the latest generation of the Cosmos World Foundation Models for Physical AI. Built on a flow-based architecture, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language model, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation. Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment, with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than [Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and [Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To accelerate research and deployment in Physical AI, we release source code, pretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open resources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the next generation of embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping fashion by enabling virtual looks and avatars making it essential to find real products that best match AI-generated styles. We propose an end-to-end product search system that has been deployed in a real-world, internet scale which ensures that AI-generated looks presented to users are matched with the most visually and semantically similar products from the indexed vector space. The search pipeline is composed of four key components: query generation, vectorization, candidate retrieval, and reranking based on AI-generated looks. Recommendation quality is evaluated using human-judged accuracy scores. The system currently serves more than 350,000 AI Looks in production per day, covering diverse product categories across global markets of over 12 million products. In our experiments, we observed that across multiple annotators and categories, CLIP outperformed alternative models by a small relative margin of 3--7\% in mean opinion scores. These improvements, though modest in absolute numbers, resulted in noticeably better user perception matches, establishing CLIP as the most reliable backbone for production deployment.

<title>PDA-LSTM: Knowledge-driven page data arrangement based on LSTM for LCM supression in QLC 3D NAND flash memories</title>

Abstract: Quarter level cell (QLC) 3D NAND flash memory is emerging as the predominant storage solution in the era of artificial intelligence. QLC 3D NAND flash stores 4 bit per cell to expand the storage density, resulting in narrower read margins. Constrained to read margins, QLC always suffers from lateral charge migration (LCM), which caused by non-uniform charge density across adjacent memory cells. To suppress charge density gap between cells, there are some algorithm in form of intra-page data mapping such as WBVM, DVDS. However, we observe inter-page data arrangements also approach the suppression. Thus, we proposed an intelligent model PDA-LSTM to arrange intra-page data for LCM suppression, which is a physics-knowledge-driven neural network model. PDA-LSTM applies a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network to compute a data arrangement probability matrix from input page data pattern. The arrangement is to minimize the global impacts derived from the LCM among wordlines. Since each page data can be arranged only once, we design a transformation from output matrix of LSTM network to non-repetitive sequence generation probability matrix to assist training process. The arranged data pattern can decrease the bit error rate (BER) during data retention. In addition, PDA-LSTM do not need extra flag bits to record data transport of 3D NAND flash compared with WBVM, DVDS. The experiment results show that the PDA-LSTM reduces the average BER by 80.4% compared with strategy without data arrangement, and by 18.4%, 15.2% compared respectively with WBVM and DVDS with code-length 64.

Abstract: Cycle rickshaw pullers are highly vulnerable to extreme heat, yet little is known about how their physiological biomarkers respond under such conditions. This study collected real-time weather and physiological data using wearable sensors from 100 rickshaw pullers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In addition, interviews with 12 pullers explored their knowledge, perceptions, and experiences related to climate change. We developed a Linear Gaussian Bayesian Network (LGBN) regression model to predict key physiological biomarkers based on activity, weather, and demographic features. The model achieved normalized mean absolute error values of 0.82, 0.47, 0.65, and 0.67 for skin temperature, relative cardiac cost, skin conductance response, and skin conductance level, respectively. Using projections from 18 CMIP6 climate models, we layered the LGBN on future climate forecasts to analyze survivability for current (2023-2025) and future years (2026-2100). Based on thresholds of WBGT above 31.1{\deg}C and skin temperature above 35{\deg}C, 32% of rickshaw pullers already face high heat exposure risk. By 2026-2030, this percentage may rise to 37% with average exposure lasting nearly 12 minutes, or about two-thirds of the trip duration. A thematic analysis of interviews complements these findings, showing that rickshaw pullers recognize their increasing climate vulnerability and express concern about its effects on health and occupational survivability.

Abstract: End-to-end architectures trained via imitation learning have advanced autonomous driving by scaling model size and data, yet performance remains brittle in safety-critical long-tail scenarios where supervision is sparse and causal understanding is limited. To address this, we introduce Alpamayo-R1 (AR1), a vision-language-action model (VLA) that integrates Chain of Causation reasoning with trajectory planning to enhance decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) the Chain of Causation (CoC) dataset, built through a hybrid auto-labeling and human-in-the-loop pipeline producing decision-grounded, causally linked reasoning traces aligned with driving behaviors; (2) a modular VLA architecture combining Cosmos-Reason, a Vision-Language Model pre-trained for Physical AI applications, with a diffusion-based trajectory decoder that generates dynamically feasible plans in real time; (3) a multi-stage training strategy using supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize reasoning quality via large reasoning model feedback and enforce reasoning-action consistency. Evaluation shows AR1 achieves up to a 12% improvement in planning accuracy on challenging cases compared to a trajectory-only baseline, with a 35% reduction in off-road rate and 25% reduction in close encounter rate in closed-loop simulation. RL post-training improves reasoning quality by 45% as measured by a large reasoning model critic and reasoning-action consistency by 37%. Model scaling from 0.5B to 7B parameters shows consistent improvements. On-vehicle road tests confirm real-time performance (99 ms latency) and successful urban deployment. By bridging interpretable reasoning with precise control, AR1 demonstrates a practical path towards Level 4 autonomous driving. We plan to release AR1 models and a subset of the CoC in a future update.

Abstract: Large language models are now integrated into many scientific workflows, accelerating data analysis, hypothesis generation, and design space exploration. In parallel with this growth, there is a growing need to carefully evaluate whether models accurately capture domain-specific knowledge and notation, since general-purpose benchmarks rarely reflect these requirements. This gap is especially clear in quantum science, which features non-intuitive phenomena and requires advanced mathematics. In this study, we introduce QuantumBench, a benchmark for the quantum domain that systematically examine how well LLMs understand and can be applied to this non-intuitive field. Using publicly available materials, we compiled approximately 800 questions with their answers spanning nine areas related to quantum science and organized them into an eight-option multiple-choice dataset. With this benchmark, we evaluate several existing LLMs and analyze their performance in the quantum domain, including sensitivity to changes in question format. QuantumBench is the first LLM evaluation dataset built for the quantum domain, and it is intended to guide the effective use of LLMs in quantum research.

<title>A filtering scheme for confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE)-video sequences for self-supervised learning</title>

Abstract: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging modality that can be used for in-situ, in-vivo imaging and the microstructural analysis of mucous structures. The diagnosis using CLE is, however, complicated by images being hard to interpret for non-experienced physicians. Utilizing machine learning as an augmentative tool would hence be beneficial, but is complicated by the shortage of histopathology-correlated CLE imaging sequences with respect to the plurality of patterns in this domain, leading to overfitting of machine learning models. To overcome this, self-supervised learning (SSL) can be employed on larger unlabeled datasets. CLE is a video-based modality with high inter-frame correlation, leading to a non-stratified data distribution for SSL training. In this work, we propose a filter functionality on CLE video sequences to reduce the dataset redundancy in SSL training and improve SSL training convergence and training efficiency. We use four state-of-the-art baseline networks and a SSL teacher-student network with a vision transformer small backbone for the evaluation. These networks were evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test accuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both considerably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL is an effective method for CLE pretraining. Further, we show that our proposed CLE video filter can be utilized to improve training efficiency in self-supervised scenarios, resulting in a reduction of 67% in training time.

Abstract: Cardiac ultrasound (US) is among the most widely used diagnostic tools in cardiology for assessing heart health, but its effectiveness is limited by operator dependence, time constraints, and human error. The shortage of trained professionals, especially in remote areas, further restricts access. These issues underscore the need for automated solutions that can ensure consistent, and accessible cardiac imaging regardless of operator skill or location. Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), has gained attention for enabling autonomous decision-making. However, existing DRL-based approaches to cardiac US scanning lack reproducibility, rely on proprietary data, and use simplified models. Motivated by these gaps, we present the first end-to-end framework that integrates generative AI and DRL to enable autonomous and reproducible cardiac US scanning. The framework comprises two components: (i) a conditional generative simulator combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), that models the cardiac US environment producing realistic action-conditioned images; and (ii) a DRL module that leverages this simulator to learn autonomous, accurate scanning policies. The proposed framework delivers AI-driven guidance through expert-validated models that classify image type and assess quality, supports conditional generation of realistic US images, and establishes a reproducible foundation extendable to other organs. To ensure reproducibility, a publicly available dataset of real cardiac US scans is released. The solution is validated through several experiments. The VAE-GAN is benchmarked against existing GAN variants, with performance assessed using qualitative and quantitative approaches, while the DRL-based scanning system is evaluated under varying configurations to demonstrate effectiveness.

Abstract: Age estimation from facial images is a complex and multifaceted challenge in computer vision. In this study, we present a novel hybrid architecture that combines ConvNeXt, a state-of-the-art advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with Vision Transformers (ViT). While each model independently delivers excellent performance on a variety of tasks, their integration leverages the complementary strengths of the CNNs localized feature extraction capabilities and the Transformers global attention mechanisms. Our proposed ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid solution was thoroughly evaluated on benchmark age estimation datasets, including MORPH II, CACD, and AFAD, and achieved superior performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). To address computational constraints, we leverage pre-trained models and systematically explore different configurations, using linear layers and advanced regularization techniques to optimize the architecture. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the critical role of individual components and training strategies, and in particular emphasize the importance of adapted attention mechanisms within the CNN framework to improve the model focus on age-relevant facial features. The results show that the ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid not only outperforms traditional methods, but also provides a robust foundation for future advances in age estimation and related visual tasks. This work underscores the transformative potential of hybrid architectures and represents a promising direction for the seamless integration of CNNs and transformers to address complex computer vision challenges.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus remains one of the most compelling and challenging benchmarks for tracking progress toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence. In contrast to other evaluation datasets designed to assess an agent's task-specific skills or accumulated knowledge, the ARC-AGI suite is specifically targeted at measuring skill acquisition efficiency, a trait that has (so far) been lacking in even the most sophisticated machine learning systems. For algorithms that require extensive intra-task exemplars, a significant constraint imposed by ARC-AGI is the modest cardinality of its demonstration set, comprising a small number of $\langle$ input, output $\rangle$ grids per task specifying the corresponding transformation. To embellish the space of viable sample pairs, this paper introduces ARC-GEN, an open-source procedural generator aimed at extending the original ARC-AGI training dataset as faithfully as possible. Unlike prior efforts, our generator is both exhaustive (covering all four-hundred tasks) and mimetic (more closely honoring the distributional properties and characteristics embodied in the initial ARC-AGI-1 release). We also discuss the use of this generator in establishing a static benchmark suite to verify the correctness of programs submitted to the 2025 Google Code Golf Championship.

Abstract: Capturing the structural changes that molecules undergo during chemical reactions in real space and time is a long-standing dream and an essential prerequisite for understanding and ultimately controlling femtochemistry. A key approach to tackle this challenging task is Coulomb explosion imaging, which benefited decisively from recently emerging high-repetition-rate X-ray free-electron laser sources. With this technique, information on the molecular structure is inferred from the momentum distributions of the ions produced by the rapid Coulomb explosion of molecules. Retrieving molecular structures from these distributions poses a highly non-linear inverse problem that remains unsolved for molecules consisting of more than a few atoms. Here, we address this challenge using a diffusion-based Transformer neural network. We show that the network reconstructs unknown molecular geometries from ion-momentum distributions with a mean absolute error below one Bohr radius, which is half the length of a typical chemical bond.

Abstract: Interpretability studies in language models often investigate forward-looking representations of activations. However, as language models become capable of doing ever longer time horizon tasks, methods for understanding activations often remain limited to testing specific concepts or tokens. We develop a framework of Residual Stream Decoders as a method of probing model activations for paragraph-scale and document-scale plans. We test several methods and find information can be decoded equivalent to 5+ tokens of future context in small models. These results lay the groundwork for better monitoring of language models and better understanding how they might encode longer-term planning information.

Abstract: The vision community is undergoing the unprecedented progress with the emergence of Vision-Language Pretraining Models (VLMs). Prompt learning plays as the holy grail of accessing VLMs since it enables their fast adaptation to downstream tasks with limited resources. Whereas existing researches milling around single-prompt paradigms, rarely investigate the technical potential behind their multi-prompt learning counterparts. This paper aims to provide a principled retrospect for vision-language multi-prompt learning. We extend the recent constant modality gap phenomenon to learnable prompts and then, justify the superiority of vision-language transfer with multi-prompt augmentation, empirically and theoretically. In terms of this observation, we propose an Energy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) to generate multiple prompt embeddings by drawing instances from an energy-based distribution, which is implicitly defined by VLMs. So our EMPL is not only parameter-efficient but also rigorously lead to the balance between in-domain and out-of-domain open-vocabulary generalization. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to justify our claims and the excellence of EMPL.

Abstract: Purpose: Visually Guided Reaching (VGR) on the Kinarm robot yields sensitive kinematic biomarkers but requires 40-64 reaches, imposing time and fatigue burdens. We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace unrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the reliability of standard Kinarm parameters.
  Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control participants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the first 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models, fine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We recomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time, posture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and compared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1).
  Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only 8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded reaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA improvements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials replaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability.
  Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR assessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5 minutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision. This forecast-augmented paradigm promises efficient robotic evaluations for assessing motor impairments following stroke.

Abstract: ``Vibe coding'' -- the practice of developing software through iteratively conversing with a large language model (LLM) -- has exploded in popularity within the last year. However, developers report key limitations including the accumulation of technical debt, security issues, and code churn to achieve satisfactory results. We argue that these pitfalls result from LLMs' inability to reconcile accumulating human-imposed constraints during vibe coding, with developers inadvertently failing to resolve contradictions because LLMs prioritize user commands over code consistency. Given LLMs' receptiveness to verification-based feedback, we argue that formal methods can mitigate these pitfalls, making vibe coding more reliable. However, we posit that integrating formal methods must transcend existing approaches that combine formal methods and LLMs. We advocate for a side-car system throughout the vibe coding process which: (1) \emph{Autoformalizes} specifications (2) Validates against targets, (3) Delivers \emph{actionable} feedback to the LLM, and (4) Allows intuitive developer influence on specifications.

Abstract: The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over 79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.

<title>Gradient Boosted Mixed Models: Flexible Joint Estimation of Mean and Variance Components for Clustered Data</title>

Abstract: Linear mixed models are widely used for clustered data, but their reliance on parametric forms limits flexibility in complex and high-dimensional settings. In contrast, gradient boosting methods achieve high predictive accuracy through nonparametric estimation, but do not accommodate clustered data structures or provide uncertainty quantification.
  We introduce Gradient Boosted Mixed Models (GBMixed), a framework and algorithm that extends boosting to jointly estimate mean and variance components via likelihood-based gradients. In addition to nonparametric mean estimation, the method models both random effects and residual variances as potentially covariate-dependent functions using flexible base learners such as regression trees or splines, enabling nonparametric estimation while maintaining interpretability.
  Simulations and real-world applications demonstrate accurate recovery of variance components, calibrated prediction intervals, and improved predictive accuracy relative to standard linear mixed models and nonparametric methods. GBMixed provides heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification and introduces boosting for heterogeneous random effects. This enables covariate-dependent shrinkage for cluster-specific predictions to adapt between population and cluster-level data. Under standard causal assumptions, the framework enables estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Everyday speech conveys far more than words, it reflects who we are, how we feel, and the circumstances surrounding our interactions. Yet, most existing speech datasets are acted, limited in scale, and fail to capture the expressive richness of real-life communication. With the rise of large neural networks, several large-scale speech corpora have emerged and been widely adopted across various speech processing tasks. However, the field of voice conversion (VC) still lacks large-scale, expressive, and real-life speech resources suitable for modeling natural prosody and emotion. To fill this gap, we release NaturalVoices (NV), the first large-scale spontaneous podcast dataset specifically designed for emotion-aware voice conversion. It comprises 5,049 hours of spontaneous podcast recordings with automatic annotations for emotion (categorical and attribute-based), speech quality, transcripts, speaker identity, and sound events. The dataset captures expressive emotional variation across thousands of speakers, diverse topics, and natural speaking styles. We also provide an open-source pipeline with modular annotation tools and flexible filtering, enabling researchers to construct customized subsets for a wide range of VC tasks. Experiments demonstrate that NaturalVoices supports the development of robust and generalizable VC models capable of producing natural, expressive speech, while revealing limitations of current architectures when applied to large-scale spontaneous data. These results suggest that NaturalVoices is both a valuable resource and a challenging benchmark for advancing the field of voice conversion.

Abstract: Identifying/retrieving relevant statutes and prior cases/precedents for a given legal situation are common tasks exercised by law practitioners. Researchers to date have addressed the two tasks independently, thus developing completely different datasets and models for each task; however, both retrieval tasks are inherently related, e.g., similar cases tend to cite similar statutes (due to similar factual situation). In this paper, we address this gap. We propose IL-PCR (Indian Legal corpus for Prior Case and Statute Retrieval), which is a unique corpus that provides a common testbed for developing models for both the tasks (Statute Retrieval and Precedent Retrieval) that can exploit the dependence between the two. We experiment extensively with several baseline models on the tasks, including lexical models, semantic models and ensemble based on GNNs. Further, to exploit the dependence between the two tasks, we develop an LLM-based re-ranking approach that gives the best performance.

Abstract: Sign language translation remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of large-scale, sentence-aligned datasets. Prior arts have focused on various feature extraction and architectural changes to support neural machine translation for sign languages. We propose POSESTITCH-SLT, a novel pre-training scheme that is inspired by linguistic-templates-based sentence generation technique. With translation comparison on two sign language datasets, How2Sign and iSign, we show that a simple transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture outperforms the prior art when considering template-generated sentence pairs in training. We achieve BLEU-4 score improvements from 1.97 to 4.56 on How2Sign and from 0.55 to 3.43 on iSign, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods for pose-based gloss-free translation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of template-driven synthetic supervision in low-resource sign language settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.

Abstract: Lightweight vision classification models such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet are increasingly deployed in mobile and embedded systems, yet their performance has been predominantly benchmarked on ImageNet. This raises critical questions: Do models that excel on ImageNet also generalize across other domains? How can cross-dataset robustness be systematically quantified? And which architectural elements consistently drive generalization under tight resource constraints? Here, we present the first systematic evaluation of 11 lightweight vision models (2.5M parameters), trained under a fixed 100-epoch schedule across 7 diverse datasets. We introduce the Cross-Dataset Score (xScore), a unified metric that quantifies the consistency and robustness of model performance across diverse visual domains. Our results show that (1) ImageNet accuracy does not reliably predict performance on fine-grained or medical datasets, (2) xScore provides a scalable predictor of mobile model performance that can be estimated from just four datasets, and (3) certain architectural components--such as isotropic convolutions with higher spatial resolution and channel-wise attention--promote broader generalization, while Transformer-based blocks yield little additional benefit, despite incurring higher parameter overhead. This study provides a reproducible framework for evaluating lightweight vision models beyond ImageNet, highlights key design principles for mobile-friendly architectures, and guides the development of future models that generalize robustly across diverse application domains.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices has resulted in significant security risks, particularly the risk of malware attacks on resource-constrained devices. Conventional deep learning methods are impractical due to resource limitations, while Federated Learning (FL) suffers from high communication overhead and vulnerability to non-IID (heterogeneous) data. In this paper, we propose a split learning (SL) based framework for IoT malware detection through image-based classification. By dividing the neural network training between the clients and an edge server, the framework reduces computational burden on resource-constrained clients while ensuring data privacy. We formulate a joint optimization problem that balances computation cost and communication efficiency by using a game-theoretic approach for attaining better training performance. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed framework outperforms popular FL methods in terms of accuracy (+6.35%), F1-score (+5.03%), high convergence speed (+14.96%), and less resource consumption (33.83%). These results establish the potential of SL as a scalable and secure paradigm for next-generation IoT security.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date geospatial data are essential for urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, and environmental management. Yet, automating urban monitoring remains difficult because curated datasets of specific urban features and their changes are scarce. We introduce OSMGen, a generative framework that creates realistic satellite imagery directly from raw OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Unlike prior work that relies on raster tiles, OSMGen uses the full richness of OSM JSON, including vector geometries, semantic tags, location, and time, giving fine-grained control over how scenes are generated. A central feature of the framework is the ability to produce consistent before-after image pairs: user edits to OSM inputs translate into targeted visual changes, while the rest of the scene is preserved. This makes it possible to generate training data that addresses scarcity and class imbalance, and to give planners a simple way to preview proposed interventions by editing map data. More broadly, OSMGen produces paired (JSON, image) data for both static and changed states, paving the way toward a closed-loop system where satellite imagery can automatically drive structured OSM updates. Source code is available at https://github.com/amir-zsh/OSMGen.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant concerns about their security against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to crafting universal jailbreaks and data extraction attacks by exploiting latent space discontinuities, an architectural vulnerability related to the sparsity of training data. Unlike previous methods, our technique generalizes across various models and interfaces, proving highly effective in seven state-of-the-art LLMs and one image generation model. Initial results indicate that when these discontinuities are exploited, they can consistently and profoundly compromise model behavior, even in the presence of layered defenses. The findings suggest that this strategy has substantial potential as a systemic attack vector.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) developed us- ing publicly available datasets predominantly focus on enterprise environ- ments, raising concerns about their effectiveness for converged Informa- tion Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) in energy infras- tructures. This study evaluates the representativeness of five widely used datasets: CIC-IDS2017, SWaT, WADI, Sherlock, and CIC-Modbus2023 against network-detectable MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques extracted from documented energy sector incidents. Using a structured five-step analyt- ical approach, this article successfully developed and performed a gap analysis that identified 94 network observable techniques from an initial pool of 274 ATT&amp;CK techniques. Sherlock dataset exhibited the high- est mean coverage (0.56), followed closely by CIC-IDS2017 (0.55), while SWaT and WADI recorded the lowest scores (0.38). Combining CIC- IDS2017, Sherlock, and CIC-Modbus2023 achieved an aggregate coverage of 92%, highlighting their complementary strengths. The analysis identi- fies critical gaps, particularly in lateral movement and industrial protocol manipulation, providing a clear pathway for dataset enhancement and more robust NIDS evaluation in hybrid IT/OT energy environments.

Abstract: Digital twins are developed to model the behavior of a specific physical asset (or twin), and they can consist of high-fidelity physics-based models or surrogates. A highly accurate surrogate is often preferred over multi-physics models as they enable forecasting the physical twin future state in real-time. To adapt to a specific physical twin, the digital twin model must be updated using in-service data from that physical twin. Here, we extend Gaussian process (GP) models to include derivative data, for improved accuracy, with dynamic updating to ingest physical twin data during service. Including derivative data, however, comes at a prohibitive cost of increased covariance matrix dimension. We circumvent this issue by using a sparse GP approximation, for which we develop extensions to incorporate derivatives. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the derivative-enhanced sparse GP method produces improved models upon dynamic data additions. Lastly, we apply the developed algorithm within a DT framework to model fatigue crack growth in an aerospace vehicle.

<title>Efficiency vs. Alignment: Investigating Safety and Fairness Risks in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly adopting and adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) hosted on public repositories such as HuggingFace. Although these adaptations often improve performance on specialized downstream tasks, recent evidence indicates that they can also degrade a model's safety or fairness. Since different fine-tuning techniques may exert distinct effects on these critical dimensions, this study undertakes a systematic assessment of their trade-offs. Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA, IA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model families (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235 fine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and nine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based approaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least disruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In contrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce safety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and increased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type: LLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest safety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation layer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not necessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single configuration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an inherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical guideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base model, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both safety and fairness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications, but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark (Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks: error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5% relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii) cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance (Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities; and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across languages.

Abstract: We introduce two multifidelity trust-region methods based on the Magical Trust Region (MTR) framework. MTR augments the classical trust-region step with a secondary, informative direction. In our approaches, the secondary ``magical'' directions are determined by solving coarse trust-region subproblems based on low-fidelity objective models. The first proposed method, Sketched Trust-Region (STR), constructs this secondary direction using a sketched matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the trust-region subproblem. The second method, SVD Trust-Region (SVDTR), defines the magical direction via a truncated singular value decomposition of the dataset, capturing the leading directions of variability. Several numerical examples illustrate the potential gain in efficiency.

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale web data through self-supervised contrastive learning. Yet, its reliance on uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of pediatric brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring, yet faces unique challenges due to limited data, high anatomical variability, and heterogeneous imaging across institutions. In this work, we present an advanced nnU-Net framework tailored for BraTS 2025 Task-6 (PED), the largest public dataset of pre-treatment pediatric high-grade gliomas. Our contributions include: (1) a widened residual encoder with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention; (2) 3D depthwise separable convolutions; (3) a specificity-driven regularization term; and (4) small-scale Gaussian weight initialization. We further refine predictions with two postprocessing steps. Our models achieved first place on the Task-6 validation leaderboard, attaining lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.759 (CC), 0.967 (ED), 0.826 (ET), 0.910 (NET), 0.928 (TC) and 0.928 (WT).

<title>FedMGP: Personalized Federated Learning with Multi-Group Text-Visual Prompts</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FedMGP, a new paradigm for personalized federated prompt learning in vision-language models. FedMGP equips each client with multiple groups of paired textual and visual prompts, enabling the model to capture diverse, fine-grained semantic and instance-level cues. A diversity loss is introduced to drive each prompt group to specialize in distinct and complementary semantic aspects, ensuring that the groups collectively cover a broader range of local characteristics. During communication, FedMGP employs a dynamic prompt aggregation strategy based on similarity-guided probabilistic sampling: each client computes the cosine similarity between its prompt groups and the global prompts from the previous round, then samples s groups via a softmax-weighted distribution. This soft selection mechanism preferentially aggregates semantically aligned knowledge while still enabling exploration of underrepresented patterns effectively balancing the preservation of common knowledge with client-specific features. Notably, FedMGP maintains parameter efficiency by redistributing a fixed prompt capacity across multiple groups, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest communication parameters among all federated prompt learning methods. Theoretical analysis shows that our dynamic aggregation strategy promotes robust global representation learning by reinforcing shared semantics while suppressing client-specific noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedMGP consistently outperforms prior approaches in both personalization and domain generalization across diverse federated vision-language benchmarks. The code will be released on https://github.com/weihao-bo/FedMGP.git.

Abstract: Neural networks are able to approximate any continuous function on a compact set. However, it is not obvious how to quantify the error of the neural network, i.e., the remaining bias between the function and the neural network. Here, we propose the application of extreme value theory to quantify large values of the error, which are typically relevant in applications. The distribution of the error beyond some threshold is approximately generalized Pareto distributed. We provide a new estimator of the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution suitable to describe the error of neural networks. Numerical experiments are provided.

<title>Multi-refined Feature Enhanced Sentiment Analysis Using Contextual Instruction</title>

Abstract: Sentiment analysis using deep learning and pre-trained language models (PLMs) has gained significant traction due to their ability to capture rich contextual representations. However, existing approaches often underperform in scenarios involving nuanced emotional cues, domain shifts, and imbalanced sentiment distributions. We argue that these limitations stem from inadequate semantic grounding, poor generalization to diverse linguistic patterns, and biases toward dominant sentiment classes. To overcome these challenges, we propose CISEA-MRFE, a novel PLM-based framework integrating Contextual Instruction (CI), Semantic Enhancement Augmentation (SEA), and Multi-Refined Feature Extraction (MRFE). CI injects domain-aware directives to guide sentiment disambiguation; SEA improves robustness through sentiment-consistent paraphrastic augmentation; and MRFE combines a Scale-Adaptive Depthwise Encoder (SADE) for multi-scale feature specialization with an Emotion Evaluator Context Encoder (EECE) for affect-aware sequence modeling. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CISEA-MRFE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements in accuracy of up to 4.6% on IMDb, 6.5% on Yelp, 30.3% on Twitter, and 4.1% on Amazon. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach for sentiment classification across varied domains.

<title>Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control</title>

Abstract: Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.

Abstract: Automatic code optimization remains a difficult challenge, particularly for complex loop nests on modern hardware. This paper investigates a novel approach to code optimization where Large Language Models (LLMs) guide the process through a closed-loop interaction with a compiler. We present ComPilot, an experimental framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs, without any task-specific fine-tuning, as interactive optimization agents. ComPilot establishes a feedback loop where an LLM proposes transformations for a given loop nest to a compiler. The compiler attempts the transformations, reporting back legality status and measured speedup or slowdown. The LLM utilizes this concrete feedback to iteratively refine its optimization strategy. Our extensive evaluation across the PolyBench benchmark suite demonstrates the effectiveness of this zero-shot approach. ComPilot achieves geometric mean speedups of 2.66x (single run) and 3.54x (best-of-5 runs) over the original code. Furthermore, ComPilot demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art Pluto polyhedral optimizer, outperforming it in many cases. This experimental study demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs can effectively guide the code optimization process when grounded by compiler feedback, opening promising research directions for agentic AI in code optimization.

<title>Node Preservation and its Effect on Crossover in Cartesian Genetic Programming</title>

Abstract: While crossover is a critical and often indispensable component in other forms of Genetic Programming, such as Linear- and Tree-based, it has consistently been claimed that it deteriorates search performance in CGP. As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.

<title>DTS: Enhancing Large Reasoning Models via Decoding Tree Sketching</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they often suffer from overthinking, producing excessively long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces that increase inference cost and may degrade accuracy. Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between reasoning length and accuracy, where across multiple stochastic decodes, the short reasoning paths consistently achieve the highest correctness, while longer ones accumulate errors and repetitions. These short optimal reasoning paths can be found ideally through full enumeration of the reasoning space. However, the tree-structured reasoning space grows exponentially with sequence length, rendering exhaustive exploration infeasible. To address this, we propose DTS, a model-agnostic decoding framework that sketches the reasoning space by selectively branching at high-entropy tokens and applies early stopping to select the shortest completed reasoning path. This approach approximates the optimal solution that enhances both efficiency and accuracy, without requiring additional training or supervision. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and 1.5B show that DTS improves accuracy by up to 8%, reduces average reasoning length by 23%, and decreases repetition frequency by 12%, demonstrating DTS's ability for scalable and efficient LRM reasoning.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in digital twins is critical to enable reliable and credible predictions beyond available data. A key challenge is that ensemble-based approaches can become prohibitively expensive when embedded in control and data assimilation loops in digital twins, even when reduced models are used. We introduce a reduced modeling approach that advances in time the mean and covariance of the reduced solution distribution induced by the initial condition uncertainties, which eliminates the need to maintain and propagate a costly ensemble of reduced solutions. The mean and covariance dynamics are obtained as a moment closure from Neural Galerkin schemes on pre-trained neural networks, which can be interpreted as filtered Neural Galerkin dynamics analogous to Gaussian filtering and the extended Kalman filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate that filtered Neural Galerkin schemes achieve more than one order of magnitude speedup compared to ensemble-based uncertainty propagation.

<title>Isotropic Curvature Model for Understanding Deep Learning Optimization: Is Gradient Orthogonalization Optimal?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model for analyzing deep learning optimization over a single iteration by leveraging the matrix structure of the weights. We derive the model by assuming isotropy of curvature, including the second-order Hessian and higher-order terms, of the loss function across all perturbation directions; hence, we call it the isotropic curvature model. This model is a convex optimization program amenable to analysis, which allows us to understand how an update on the weights in the form of a matrix relates to the change in the total loss function. As an application, we use the isotropic curvature model to analyze the recently introduced Muon optimizer and other matrix-gradient methods for training language models. First, we show that under a general growth condition on the curvature, the optimal update matrix is obtained by making the spectrum of the original gradient matrix more homogeneous -- that is, making its singular values closer in ratio -- which in particular improves the conditioning of the update matrix. Next, we show that the orthogonalized gradient becomes optimal for the isotropic curvature model when the curvature exhibits a phase transition in growth. Taken together, these results suggest that the gradient orthogonalization employed in Muon and other related methods is directionally correct but may not be strictly optimal. Finally, we discuss future research on how to leverage the isotropic curvature model for designing new optimization methods for training deep learning and language models.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging suffers from substantial data heterogeneity and the absence of standardized contrast labels across scanners, protocols, and institutions, which severely limits large-scale automated analysis. A unified representation of MRI contrast would enable a wide range of downstream utilities, from automatic sequence recognition to harmonization and quality control, without relying on manual annotations. To this end, we introduce MR-CLIP, a metadata-guided framework that learns MRI contrast representations by aligning volumetric images with their DICOM acquisition parameters. The resulting embeddings shows distinct clusters of MRI sequences and outperform supervised 3D baselines under data scarcity in few-shot sequence classification. Moreover, MR-CLIP enables unsupervised data quality control by identifying corrupted or inconsistent metadata through image-metadata embedding distances. By transforming routinely available acquisition metadata into a supervisory signal, MR-CLIP provides a scalable foundation for label-efficient MRI analysis across diverse clinical datasets.

Abstract: The field of simulation optimization (SO) encompasses various methods developed to optimize complex, expensive-to-sample stochastic systems. Established methods include, but are not limited to, ranking-and-selection for finite alternatives and surrogate-based methods for continuous domains, with broad applications in engineering and operations management. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for exploiting system structure and automating the strategic selection and composition of these established SO methods into a tailored optimization procedure. This work introduces SOCRATES (Simulation Optimization with Correlated Replicas and Adaptive Trajectory Evaluations), a novel two-stage procedure that leverages LLMs to automate the design of tailored SO algorithms. The first stage constructs an ensemble of digital replicas of the real system. An LLM is employed to implement causal discovery from a textual description of the system, generating a structural `skeleton' that guides the sample-efficient learning of the replicas. In the second stage, this replica ensemble is used as an inexpensive testbed to evaluate a set of baseline SO algorithms. An LLM then acts as a meta-optimizer, analyzing the performance trajectories of these algorithms to iteratively revise and compose a final, hybrid optimization schedule. This schedule is designed to be adaptive, with the ability to be updated during the final execution on the real system when the optimization performance deviates from expectations. By integrating LLM-driven reasoning with LLM-assisted trajectory-aware meta-optimization, SOCRATES creates an effective and sample-efficient solution for complex SO optimization problems.

Abstract: Agentic AI frameworks add a decision-making orchestrator embedded with external tools, including web search, Python interpreter, contextual database, and others, on top of monolithic LLMs, turning them from passive text oracles into autonomous problem-solvers that can plan, call tools, remember past steps, and adapt on the fly.
  This paper aims to characterize and understand the system bottlenecks introduced by agentic AI workloads from a largely overlooked CPU-centric perspective. We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of orchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and repetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level performance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five representative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow, Langchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and demystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We observe that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total latency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors - coherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main memory capacity and bandwidth; \circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to 44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling insights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching (CGAM) and 2. Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS) for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively to demonstrate the potential to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of agentic AI. We achieve up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup compared to the multi-processing benchmark for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively.

Abstract: Computation with the Ising model is central to future computing technologies like quantum annealing, adiabatic quantum computing, and thermodynamic classical computing. Traditionally, computed values have been equated with ground states. This paper generalizes computation with ground states to computation with spin averages, allowing computations to take place at high temperatures. It then introduces a systematic correspondence between Ising devices and neural networks and a simple method to run trained feed-forward neural networks on Ising-type hardware. Finally, a mathematical proof is offered that these implementations are always successful.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a surrogate-based optimisation technique that efficiently solves expensive black-box functions with small evaluation budgets. Recent studies consider trust regions to improve the scalability of BO approaches when the problem space scales to more dimensions. Motivated by this research, we explore the effectiveness of trust region-based BO algorithms for diversity optimisation in different dimensional black box problems. We propose diversity optimisation approaches extending TuRBO1, which is the first BO method that uses a trust region-based approach for scalability. We extend TuRBO1 as divTuRBO1, which finds an optimal solution while maintaining a given distance threshold relative to a reference solution set. We propose two approaches to find diverse solutions for black-box functions by combining divTuRBO1 runs in a sequential and an interleaving fashion. We conduct experimental investigations on the proposed algorithms and compare their performance with that of the baseline method, ROBOT (rank-ordered Bayesian optimisation with trust regions). We evaluate proposed algorithms on benchmark functions with dimensions 2 to 20. Experimental investigations demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well, particularly in larger dimensions, even with a limited evaluation budget.

Abstract: Measuring similarity in urban spatial networks is key to understanding cities as complex systems. Yet most existing methods are not tailored for spatial networks and struggle to differentiate them effectively. We propose GCA-Sim, a similarity-evaluation framework based on graph cellular automata. Each submodel measures similarity by the divergence between value distributions recorded at multiple stages of an information evolution process. We find that some propagation rules magnify differences among network signals; we call this "network resonance." With an improved differentiable logic-gate network, we learn several submodels that induce network resonance. We evaluate similarity through clustering performance on fifty city-level and fifty district-level road networks. The submodels in this framework outperform existing methods, with Silhouette scores above 0.9. Using the best submodel, we further observe that planning-led street networks are less internally homogeneous than organically grown ones; morphological categories from different domains contribute with comparable importance; and degree, as a basic topological signal, becomes increasingly aligned with land value and related variables over iterations.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are central to modern healthcare delivery and research; yet, many researchers lack the database expertise necessary to write complex SQL queries or generate effective visualizations, limiting efficient data use and scientific discovery. To address this barrier, we introduce CELEC, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework for automated EHR data extraction and analytics. CELEC translates natural language queries into SQL using a prompting strategy that integrates schema information, few-shot demonstrations, and chain-of-thought reasoning, which together improve accuracy and robustness. On a subset of the EHRSQL benchmark, CELEC achieves execution accuracy comparable to prior systems while maintaining low latency, cost efficiency, and strict privacy by exposing only database metadata to the LLM. CELEC also adheres to strict privacy protocols: the LLM accesses only database metadata (e.g., table and column names), while all query execution occurs securely within the institutional environment, ensuring that no patient-level data is ever transmitted to or shared with the LLM. Ablation studies confirm that each component of the SQL generation pipeline, particularly the few-shot demonstrations, plays a critical role in performance. By lowering technical barriers and enabling medical researchers to query EHR databases directly, CELEC streamlines research workflows and accelerates biomedical discovery.

Abstract: Maximizing training throughput and cost-efficiency of RL for LLMs is essential to democratize this advanced technique. One promising but challenging approach is to deploy such a computational workflow over heterogeneous GPUs. Unlike conventional large-scale LLM pretraining, RL training generally decomposes into three coupled stages, i.e., rollout generation, reward computation, and policy/value updates, which exhibit markedly different compute intensities, memory footprints, and communication patterns. Recent research shows that fully asynchronous RL training can disaggregate these stages across disjoint hardware pools without sacrificing training stability, creating a great opportunity for real-world heterogeneous deployment. To this end, we present AReaL-Hex, a heterogeneity-aware asynchronous RL training system that effectively schedules how to execute rollout generation and policy model training over heterogeneous GPUs while enforcing data staleness bounds. Concretely, we use a two-phase scheduler: (i) a constrained search with MILP to select per-stage parallelization strategies and workload assignments given a resource budget, and (ii) a graph-partitioning step that allocates heterogeneous GPUs and interconnects to maximize end-to-end throughput. Built atop a fully asynchronous RL architecture, AReaL-Hex maps HBM-I/O-bound generation and compute-bound optimization to more cost-efficient resources and balances their producer-consumer interactions to avoid both idleness and stale rollout trajectories. On the mathematical reasoning task with various model scales (1.5B, 7B, and 14B), compared to homogeneous deployments of state-of-the-art asynchronous RL systems: (i) When maintaining the same total budgets, AReaL-Hex delivers up to 1.50x higher training throughput; (ii) When achieving the same training throughput, AReaL-Hex results in up to 1.46x reduction in training cost.

Abstract: With the software industry shifting toward a data-driven culture, online A/B testing is a key tool for evaluating new technologies. However, deploying such experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare, recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose \textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent} framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated "growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling data-driven decision-making in production.

<title>GUI-AIMA: Aligning Intrinsic Multimodal Attention with a Context Anchor for GUI Grounding</title>

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions. Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals. These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides, its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage. GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among 3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 58.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro and 62.2% on OSWorld-G.

Abstract: Autonomous systems often must predict the motions of nearby agents from partial and noisy data. This paper asks and answers the question: "can we learn, in real-time, a nonlinear predictive model of another agent's motions?" Our online framework denoises and forecasts such dynamics using a modified sliding-window Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Hankel-DMD). Partial noisy measurements are embedded into a Hankel matrix, while an associated Page matrix enables singular-value hard thresholding (SVHT) to estimate the effective rank. A Cadzow projection enforces structured low-rank consistency, yielding a denoised trajectory and local noise variance estimates. From this representation, a time-varying Hankel-DMD lifted linear predictor is constructed for multi-step forecasts. The residual analysis provides variance-tracking signals that can support downstream estimators and risk-aware planning. We validate the approach in simulation under Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise, and experimentally on a dynamic crane testbed. Results show that the method achieves stable variance-aware denoising and short-horizon prediction suitable for integration into real-time control frameworks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for deploying deep learning models in open-world environments. Existing approaches, such as energy-based scoring and gradient-projection methods, typically rely on high-dimensional representations to separate in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. We introduce P-OCS (Perturbations in the Orthogonal Complement Subspace), a lightweight and theoretically grounded method that operates in the orthogonal complement of the principal subspace defined by ID features. P-OCS applies a single projected perturbation restricted to this complementary subspace, enhancing subtle ID-OOD distinctions while preserving the geometry of ID representations. We show that a one-step update is sufficient in the small-perturbation regime and provide convergence guarantees for the resulting detection score. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that P-OCS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection with negligible computational cost and without requiring model retraining, access to OOD data, or changes to model architecture.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing intentions is crucial for the navigation of mobile robots and intelligent vehicles. Although recent deep learning-based models have shown significant success in forecasting intentions, few consider incomplete observation under occlusion scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Occlusion-Aware Diffusion Model (ODM) that reconstructs occluded motion patterns and leverages them to guide future intention prediction. During the denoising stage, we introduce an occlusion-aware diffusion transformer architecture to estimate noise features associated with occluded patterns, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture contextual relationships in occluded semantic scenarios. Furthermore, an occlusion mask-guided reverse process is introduced to effectively utilize observation information, reducing the accumulation of prediction errors and enhancing the accuracy of reconstructed motion features. The performance of the proposed method under various occlusion scenarios is comprehensively evaluated and compared with existing methods on popular benchmarks, namely PIE and JAAD. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more robust performance than existing methods in the literature.

Abstract: The presence of social biases in large language models (LLMs) has become a significant concern in AI research. These biases, often embedded in training data, can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and distort decision-making processes. When LLMs are integrated into ranking systems, they can propagate these biases, leading to unfair outcomes in critical applications such as search engines and recommendation systems. Backpack Language Models, unlike traditional transformer-based models that treat text sequences as monolithic structures, generate outputs as weighted combinations of non-contextual, learned word aspects, also known as senses. Leveraging this architecture, we propose a framework for debiasing ranking tasks. Our experimental results show that this framework effectively mitigates gender bias in text retrieval and ranking with minimal degradation in performance.

Abstract: Step-by-step reasoning has become a standard approach for large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks. While this paradigm has proven effective, it raises a fundamental question: How can we verify that an LLM's reasoning is accurately grounded in knowledge? To address this question, we introduce a novel evaluation suite that systematically assesses the knowledge grounding of intermediate reasoning. Our framework comprises three key components. (1) Principal Knowledge Collection, a large-scale repository of atomic knowledge essential for reasoning. Based on the collection, we propose (2) knowledge-grounded evaluation metrics designed to measure how well models recall and apply prerequisite knowledge in reasoning. These metrics are computed by our (3) evaluator LLM, a lightweight model optimized for cost-effective and reliable metric computation. Our evaluation suite demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in identifying missing or misapplied knowledge elements, providing crucial insights for uncovering fundamental reasoning deficiencies in LLMs. Beyond evaluation, we demonstrate how these metrics can be integrated into preference optimization, showcasing further applications of knowledge-grounded evaluation.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate deep learning (DL) models for enhancing vitreous optical coherence tomography (OCT) image quality and reducing acquisition time. Methods: Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPMs), Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models (BBDMs), U-Net, Pix2Pix, and Vector-Quantised Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-GAN) were used to generate high-quality spectral-domain (SD) vitreous OCT images. Inputs were SD ART10 images, and outputs were compared to pseudoART100 images obtained by averaging ten ART10 images per eye location. Model performance was assessed using image quality metrics and Visual Turing Tests, where ophthalmologists ranked generated images and evaluated anatomical fidelity. The best model's performance was further tested within the manually segmented vitreous on newly acquired data. Results: U-Net achieved the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 30.230) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 0.820), followed by cDDPM. For Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), Pix2Pix (0.697) and cDDPM (0.753) performed best. In the first Visual Turing Test, cDDPM ranked highest (3.07); in the second (best model only), cDDPM achieved a 32.9% fool rate and 85.7% anatomical preservation. On newly acquired data, cDDPM generated vitreous regions more similar in PSNR to the ART100 reference than true ART1 or ART10 B-scans and achieved higher PSNR on whole images when conditioned on ART1 than ART10. Conclusions: Results reveal discrepancies between quantitative metrics and clinical evaluation, highlighting the need for combined assessment. cDDPM showed strong potential for generating clinically meaningful vitreous OCT images while reducing acquisition time fourfold. Translational Relevance: cDDPMs show promise for clinical integration, supporting faster, higher-quality vitreous imaging. Dataset and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We deal with the solution of the forward problem for high-dimensional parabolic PDEs with random feature (projection) neural networks (RFNNs). We first prove that there exists a single-hidden layer neural network with randomized heat-kernels arising from the fundamental solution (Green's functions) of the heat operator, that we call HEATNET, that provides an unbiased universal approximator to the solution of parabolic PDEs in arbitrary (high) dimensions, with the rate of convergence being analogous to the ${O}(N^{-1/2})$, where $N$ is the size of HEATNET. Thus, HEATNETs are explainable schemes, based on the analytical framework of parabolic PDEs, exploiting insights from physics-informed neural networks aided by numerical and functional analysis, and the structure of the corresponding solution operators. Importantly, we show how HEATNETs can be scaled up for the efficient numerical solution of arbitrary high-dimensional parabolic PDEs using suitable transformations and importance Monte Carlo sampling of the integral representation of the solution, in order to deal with the singularities of the heat kernel around the collocation points. We evaluate the performance of HEATNETs through benchmark linear parabolic problems up to 2,000 dimensions. We show that HEATNETs result in remarkable accuracy with the order of the approximation error ranging from $1.0E-05$ to $1.0E-07$ for problems up to 500 dimensions, and of the order of $1.0E-04$ to $1.0E-03$ for 1,000 to 2,000 dimensions, with a relatively low number (up to 15,000) of features.

Abstract: We investigate how fully-passive electromagnetic skins (EMSs) can be engineered to enhance channel charting (CC) in dense urban environments. We employ two complementary state-of-the-art CC techniques, semi-supervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and a semi-supervised Autoencoder (AE), to verify the consistency of results across nonparametric and parametric mappings. We show that the accuracy of CC hinges on a balance between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial dissimilarity: EMS codebooks that only maximize gain, as in conventional Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) optimization, suppress location fingerprints and degrade CC, while randomized phases increase diversity but reduce SNR. To address this trade-off, we design static EMS phase profiles via a quantile-driven criterion that targets worst-case users and improves both trustworthiness and continuity. In a 3D ray-traced city at 30 GHz, the proposed EMS reduces the 90th-percentile localization error from > 50 m to < 25 m for both t-SNE and AE-based CC, and decreases severe trajectory dropouts by over 4x under 15% supervision. The improvements hold consistently across the evaluated configurations, establishing static, pre-configured EMS as a practical enabler of CC without reconfiguration overheads.

Abstract: Effective modeling of how human travelers learn and adjust their travel behavior from interacting with transportation systems is critical for system assessment and planning. However, this task is also difficult due to the complex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent research has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task. Building on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables continuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on learning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach involves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a learnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure behavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the reasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these traveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track and align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce realistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day route choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and aggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method moves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying learning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization. Overall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and behaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation that can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis.

Abstract: We consider the reconstruction of a codeword from multiple noisy copies that are independently corrupted by insertions, deletions, and substitutions. This problem arises, for example, in DNA data storage. A common code construction uses a concatenated coding scheme that combines an outer linear block code with an inner code, which can be either a nonlinear marker code or a convolutional code. Outer decoding is done with Belief Propagation, and inner decoding is done with the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. However, the BCJR algorithm scales exponentially with the number of noisy copies, which makes it infeasible to reconstruct a codeword from more than about four copies. In this work, we introduce BCJRFormer, a transformer-based neural inner decoder. BCJRFormer achieves error rates comparable to the BCJR algorithm for binary and quaternary single-message transmissions of marker codes. Importantly, BCJRFormer scales quadratically with the number of noisy copies. This property makes BCJRFormer well-suited for DNA data storage, where multiple reads of the same DNA strand occur. To lower error rates, we replace the Belief Propagation outer decoder with a transformer-based decoder. Together, these modifications yield an efficient and performant end-to-end transformer-based pipeline for decoding multiple noisy copies affected by insertion, deletion, and substitution errors. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-attending transformer architecture called ConvBCJRFormer. This architecture extends BCJRFormer to decode transmissions of convolutional codewords, serving as an initial step toward joint inner and outer decoding for more general linear code classes.

Abstract: Art authentication of Francisco Goya's works presents complex computational challenges due to his heterogeneous stylistic evolution and extensive historical patterns of forgery. We introduce a novel multimodal machine learning framework that applies identical feature extraction techniques to both visual and X-ray radiographic images of Goya paintings. The unified feature extraction pipeline incorporates Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix descriptors, Local Binary Patterns, entropy measures, energy calculations, and colour distribution analysis applied consistently across both imaging modalities. The extracted features from both visual and X-ray images are processed through an optimised One-Class Support Vector Machine with hyperparameter tuning. Using a dataset of 24 authenticated Goya paintings with corresponding X-ray images, split into an 80/20 train-test configuration with 10-fold cross-validation, the framework achieves 97.8% classification accuracy with a 0.022 false positive rate. Case study analysis of ``Un Gigante'' demonstrates the practical efficacy of our pipeline, achieving 92.3% authentication confidence through unified multimodal feature analysis. Our results indicate substantial performance improvement over single-modal approaches, establishing the effectiveness of applying identical computational methods to both visual and radiographic imagery in art authentication applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the sciences, yet general conversational AI systems often generate unverified "hallucinations" undermining scientific rigor. We present OceanAI, a conversational platform that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with original data references; others either declined to answer or provided unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency, reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled decision support within the oceans. A public demonstration is available at https://oceanai.ai4ocean.xyz.

Abstract: We analyze subliminal transfer in Transformer models, where a teacher embeds hidden traits that can be linearly decoded by a student without degrading main-task performance. Prior work often attributes transferability to global representational similarity, typically quantified with Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). Using synthetic corpora with disentangled public and private labels, we distill students under matched and independent random initializations. We find that transfer strength hinges on alignment within a trait-discriminative subspace: same-seed students inherit this alignment and show higher leakage {\tau \approx} 0.24, whereas different-seed students--despite global CKA > 0.9--exhibit substantially reduced excess accuracy {\tau \approx} 0.12 - 0.13. We formalize this with subspace-level CKA diagnostic and residualized probes, showing that leakage tracks alignment within the trait-discriminative subspace rather than global representational similarity. Security controls (projection penalty, adversarial reversal, right-for-the-wrong-reasons regularization) reduce leakage in same-base models without impairing public-task fidelity. These results establish seed-induced uniqueness as a resilience property and argue for subspace-aware diagnostics for secure multi-model deployments.

<title>Binary perceptron computational gap -- a parametric fl RDT view</title>

arXiv:2511.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) likely exhibits the so-called statistical-computational gap characterized with the appearance of two phase transitioning constraint density thresholds: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the \emph{satisfiability threshold} $\alpha_c$, below/above which ABP succeeds/fails to operate as a storage memory; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} \emph{algorithmic threshold} $\alpha_a$, below/above which one can/cannot efficiently determine ABP's weight so that it operates as a storage memory.
  We consider a particular parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) [85] and study its potential ABP's algorithmic implications. A remarkable structural parametric change is uncovered as one progresses through fl RDT lifting levels. On the first two levels, the so-called $\c$ sequence -- a key parametric fl RDT component -- is of the (natural) decreasing type. A change of such phenomenology on higher levels is then connected to the $\alpha_c$ -- $\alpha_a$ threshold change. Namely, on the second level concrete numerical values give for the critical constraint density $\alpha=\alpha_c\approx 0.8331$. While progressing through higher levels decreases this estimate, already on the fifth level we observe a satisfactory level of convergence and obtain $\alpha\approx 0.7764$. This allows to draw two striking parallels: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the obtained constraint density estimate is in a remarkable agrement with range $\alpha\in (0.77,0.78)$ of clustering defragmentation (believed to be responsible for failure of locally improving algorithms) [17,88]; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} the observed change of $\c$ sequence phenomenology closely matches the one of the negative Hopfield model for which the existence of efficient algorithms that closely approach similar type of threshold has been demonstrated recently [87].

<title>Generalized Guarantees for Variational Inference in the Presence of Even and Elliptical Symmetry</title>

Abstract: We extend several recent results providing symmetry-based guarantees for variational inference (VI) with location-scale families. VI approximates a target density~$p$ by the best match $q^*$ in a family $Q$ of tractable distributions that in general does not contain $p$. It is known that VI can recover key properties of $p$, such as its mean and correlation matrix, when $p$ and $Q$ exhibit certain symmetries and $q^*$ is found by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. We extend these guarantees in two important directions. First, we provide symmetry-based guarantees for a broader family of divergences, highlighting the properties of variational objectives under which VI provably recovers the mean and correlation matrix. Second, we obtain further guarantees for VI when the target density $p$ exhibits even and elliptical symmetries in some but not all of its coordinates. These partial symmetries arise naturally in Bayesian hierarchical models, where the prior induces a challenging geometry but still possesses axes of symmetry. We illustrate these theoretical results in a number of experimental settings.

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of determining an image's geographic origin, poses significant challenges, largely due to visual similarities across disparate locations and the large search space. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical sequence prediction approach inspired by how humans narrow down locations from broad regions to specific addresses. Analogously, our model predicts geographic tokens hierarchically, first identifying a general region and then sequentially refining predictions to increasingly precise locations. Rather than relying on explicit semantic partitions, our method uses S2 cells, a nested, multiresolution global grid, and sequentially predicts finer-level cells conditioned on visual inputs and previous predictions. This procedure mirrors autoregressive text generation in large language models. Much like in language modeling, final performance depends not only on training but also on inference-time strategy. We investigate multiple top-down traversal methods for autoregressive sampling, incorporating techniques from test-time compute scaling used in language models. Specifically, we integrate beam search and multi-sample inference while exploring various selection strategies to determine the final output. This enables the model to manage uncertainty by exploring multiple plausible paths through the hierarchy. We evaluate our method on the Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k datasets against two distinct sets of baselines: those that operate without a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and those that leverage one. In the MLLM-free setting, our model surpasses other comparable baselines on nearly all metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accuracy gains of up to 13.9%. When augmented with an MLLM, our model outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across all metrics. The source code is available at https://github.com/NNargesNN/GeoToken.

Abstract: The emergence of 5G and 6G networks has established network slicing as a significant part of future service-oriented architectures, demanding refined identification methods supported by robust datasets. The article presents SliceVision-F2I, a dataset of synthetic samples for studying feature visualization in network slicing for next-generation networking systems. The dataset transforms multivariate Key Performance Indicator (KPI) vectors into visual representations through four distinct encoding methods: physically inspired mappings, Perlin noise, neural wallpapering, and fractal branching. For each encoding method, 30,000 samples are generated, each comprising a raw KPI vector and a corresponding RGB image at low-resolution pixels. The dataset simulates realistic and noisy network conditions to reflect operational uncertainties and measurement imperfections. SliceVision-F2I is suitable for tasks involving visual learning, network state classification, anomaly detection, and benchmarking of image-based machine learning techniques applied to network data. The dataset is publicly available and can be reused in various research contexts, including multivariate time series analysis, synthetic data generation, and feature-to-image transformations.

Abstract: Foundational marked temporal point process (MTPP) models, such as the Hawkes process, often use inexpressive model families in order to offer interpretable parameterizations of event data. On the other hand, neural MTPPs models forego this interpretability in favor of absolute predictive performance. In this work, we present a new family MTPP models: the hyper Hawkes process (HHP), which aims to be as flexible and performant as neural MTPPs, while retaining interpretable aspects. To achieve this, the HHP extends the classical Hawkes process to increase its expressivity by first expanding the dimension of the process into a latent space, and then introducing a hypernetwork to allow time- and data-dependent dynamics. These extensions define a highly performant MTPP family, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmark tasks and metrics. Furthermore, by retaining the linearity of the recurrence, albeit now piecewise and conditionally linear, the HHP also retains much of the structure of the original Hawkes process, which we exploit to create direct probes into how the model creates predictions. HHP models therefore offer both state-of-the-art predictions, while also providing an opportunity to ``open the box'' and inspect how predictions were generated.

<title>SLAP: Shortcut Learning for Abstract Planning</title>

Abstract: Long-horizon decision-making with sparse rewards and continuous states and actions remains a fundamental challenge in AI and robotics. Task and motion planning (TAMP) is a model-based framework that addresses this challenge by planning hierarchically with abstract actions (options). These options are manually defined, limiting the agent to behaviors that we as human engineers know how to program (pick, place, move). In this work, we propose Shortcut Learning for Abstract Planning (SLAP), a method that leverages existing TAMP options to automatically discover new ones. Our key idea is to use model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to learn shortcuts in the abstract planning graph induced by the existing options in TAMP. Without any additional assumptions or inputs, shortcut learning leads to shorter solutions than pure planning, and higher task success rates than flat and hierarchical RL. Qualitatively, SLAP discovers dynamic physical improvisations (e.g., slap, wiggle, wipe) that differ significantly from the manually-defined ones. In experiments in four simulated robotic environments, we show that SLAP solves and generalizes to a wide range of tasks, reducing overall plan lengths by over 50% and consistently outperforming planning and RL baselines.

Abstract: Charge carrier dynamics critically affect the efficiency and stability of organic photovoltaic devices, but they are challenging to model with traditional analytical methods. We introduce \b{eta}-Linearly Decoded Latent Ordinary Differential Equations (\b{eta}-LLODE), a machine learning framework that disentangles and reconstructs extraction dynamics from time-resolved charge extraction measurements of P3HT:PCBM cells. This model enables the isolated analysis of the underlying charge carrier behaviour, which was found to be well described by a compressed exponential decay. Furthermore, the learnt interpretable latent space enables simulation, including both interpolation and extrapolation of experimental measurement conditions, offering a predictive tool for solar cell research to support device study and optimisation.

Abstract: We propose CatEquiv, a category-equivariant neural network for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from inertial sensors that systematically encodes temporal, amplitude, and structural symmetries. In particular, we introduce the categorical symmetry product where cyclic time shifts, positive gains and the sensor-hierarchy poset together capture the categorical symmetry structure of the data. CatEquiv achieves equivariance with respect to the categorical symmetry product. On UCI-HAR under out-of-distribution perturbations, CatEquiv attains markedly higher robustness compared with circularly padded CNNs and plain CNNs. These results demonstrate that enforcing categorical symmetries yields strong invariance and generalization without additional model capacity.

Abstract: Medical imaging relies heavily on large, labeled datasets. But, unfortunately, they are not always easily accessible in clinical settings. Additionally, many practitioners often face various structural obstacles like limited data availability, fragmented data systems, and unbalanced datasets. These barriers often lead to the increased diagnostic uncertainty, underrepresentation of certain conditions, reduced model robustness, and biased diagnostic decisions. In response to these challenges, approaches such as transfer learning, meta-learning, and multimodal fusion have made great strides. However, they still need a solid theoretical justification for why they succeed or fail in situations where data is scarce. To address this gap, we propose a unified theoretical framework that characterizes learning and inference under low-resource medical imaging conditions. We first formalize the learning objective under few-shot conditions and compute sample complexity constraints to estimate the smallest quantity of data needed to achieve clinically reliable accuracy. Then based on ideas from PAC-learning and PAC-Bayesian theory, we explain how multimodal integration encourages generalization and quantifies uncertainty under sparse supervision. We further propose a formal metric for explanation stability, offering interpretability guarantees under low-data conditions. Taken together, the proposed framework establishes a principled foundation for constructing dependable, data-efficient diagnostic systems by jointly characterizing sample efficiency, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability in a unified theoretical setting.

Abstract: Salespeople frequently face the dynamic screening decision of whether to persist in a conversation or abandon it to pursue the next lead. Yet, little is known about how these decisions are made, whether they are efficient, or how to improve them. We study these decisions in the context of high-volume outbound sales where leads are ample, but time is scarce and failure is common. We formalize the dynamic screening decision as an optimal stopping problem and develop a generative language model-based sequential decision agent - a stopping agent - that learns whether and when to quit conversations by imitating a retrospectively-inferred optimal stopping policy. Our approach handles high-dimensional textual states, scales to large language models, and works with both open-source and proprietary language models. When applied to calls from a large European telecommunications firm, our stopping agent reduces the time spent on failed calls by 54% while preserving nearly all sales; reallocating the time saved increases expected sales by up to 37%. Upon examining the linguistic cues that drive salespeople's quitting decisions, we find that they tend to overweight a few salient expressions of consumer disinterest and mispredict call failure risk, suggesting cognitive bounds on their ability to make real-time conversational decisions. Our findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to correct cognitively-bounded human decisions and improve salesforce efficiency.

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) offers a label-free paradigm for adapting models using only synthetic signals at inference, but its success hinges on constructing reliable learning signals. Standard approaches such as majority voting often collapse to spurious yet popular answers. We introduce Self-Harmony, a framework built on a simple intuition: the correct answer should remain stable across both an original question and its paraphrase. Self-Harmony operationalizes this by employing a single model in two complementary roles: a Solver to produce answers and a Reframer to rephrase the input. Based on this, we further propose a pseudo-label method: instead of majority voting, it aggregates answer frequencies across these original and reframed views using the harmonic mean. This is a process that naturally selects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap of favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human supervision or auxiliary models. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, Self-Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results at the label-free test-time setting, ranking first in 28 of 30 settings across multiple methods. Beyond accuracy, it demonstrates unprecedented robustness, with zero training failures in all experiments, underscoring its stability and reliability.

Abstract: Missing data is a fundamental challenge in data science, significantly hindering analysis and decision-making across a wide range of disciplines, including healthcare, bioinformatics, social science, e-commerce, and industrial monitoring. Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.

Abstract: Quantum computing technology is advancing rapidly. Yet, even accounting for these trends, a quantum leap would be needed for quantum computers to mean- ingfully impact deep learning over the coming decade or two. We arrive at this conclusion based on a first-of-its-kind survey of quantum algorithms and how they match potential deep learning applications. This survey reveals three important areas where quantum computing could potentially accelerate deep learning, each of which faces a challenging roadblock to realizing its potential. First, quantum algorithms for matrix multiplication and other algorithms central to deep learning offer small theoretical improvements in the number of operations needed, but this advantage is overwhelmed on practical problem sizes by how slowly quantum computers do each operation. Second, some promising quantum algorithms depend on practical Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), which is underdeveloped. Finally, there are quantum algorithms that offer large theoretical advantages, but which are only applicable to special cases, limiting their practical benefits. In each of these areas, we support our arguments using quantitative forecasts of quantum advantage that build on the work by Choi et al. [2023] as well as new research on limitations and quantum hardware trends. Our analysis outlines the current scope of quantum deep learning and points to research directions that could lead to greater practical advances in the field.

Abstract: Current motion-conditioned video generation methods suffer from prohibitive latency (minutes per video) and non-causal processing that prevents real-time interaction. We present MotionStream, enabling sub-second latency with up to 29 FPS streaming generation on a single GPU. Our approach begins by augmenting a text-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos that adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not perform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher into a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching Distillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges arise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons: (1) bridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to infinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error accumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in computational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is introducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with attention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV cache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time extrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation of arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in motion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster, uniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint trajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in real-time, delivering a truly interactive experience.

Abstract: Pretrained Transformers excel at in-context learning (ICL), inferring new tasks from only a handful of examples. Yet, their ICL performance can degrade sharply under distribution shift between pretraining and test data, a regime increasingly common in real-world deployments. While recent empirical work hints that adjusting the attention temperature in the softmax can enhance Transformer performance, the attention temperature's role in ICL under distribution shift remains unexplored. This paper provides the first theoretical and empirical study of attention temperature for ICL under distribution shift. Using a simplified but expressive "linearized softmax" framework, we derive closed-form generalization error expressions and prove that shifts in input covariance or label noise substantially impair ICL, but that an optimal attention temperature exists which minimizes this error. We then validate our predictions through extensive simulations on linear regression tasks and large-scale experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMA2-7B on question-answering benchmarks. Our results establish attention temperature as a principled and powerful mechanism for improving the robustness of ICL in pretrained Transformers, advancing theoretical understanding and providing actionable guidance for selecting attention temperature in practice.

Abstract: We introduce a simple, general framework that takes any differentially private estimator of any arbitrary quantity as a black box, and from it constructs a differentially private nonparametric confidence interval of that quantity. Our approach repeatedly subsamples the data, applies the private estimator to each subsample, and then post-processes the resulting empirical CDF to a confidence interval. Our analysis uses the randomness from the subsampling to achieve privacy amplification. Under mild assumptions, the empirical CDF we obtain approaches the CDF of the private statistic as the sample size grows. We use this to show that the confidence intervals we estimate are asymptotically valid, tight, and equivalent to their non-private counterparts. We provide empirical evidence that our method performs well compared with the (less-general) state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful general-purpose policies for robotic manipulation, benefiting from large-scale multi-modal pre-training. However, they often fail to generalize reliably in out-of-distribution deployments, where unavoidable disturbances such as observation noise, sensor errors, or actuation perturbations become prevalent. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training provides a practical means to adapt pre-trained VLA models, existing methods mainly emphasize reward maximization and overlook robustness to environmental uncertainty. In this work, we introduce RobustVLA, a lightweight online RL post-training method designed to explicitly enhance the resilience of VLA models. Through a systematic robustness analysis, we identify two key regularizations: Jacobian regularization, which mitigates sensitivity to observation noise, and smoothness regularization, which stabilizes policies under action perturbations. Extensive experiments across diverse robotic environments demonstrate that RobustVLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in robustness and reliability. Our results highlight the importance of principled robustness-aware RL post-training as a key step toward improving the reliability and robustness of VLA models.

Abstract: Mathematical expressions (MEs) have complex two-dimensional structures in which symbols can be present at any nested depth like superscripts, subscripts, above, below etc. As MEs are represented using LaTeX format, several text retrieval methods based on string matching, vector space models etc., have also been applied for ME retrieval problem in the literature. As these methods are based on syntactic similarity, recently deep learning approaches based on embedding have been used for semantic similarity. In our present work, we have focused on the retrieval of mathematical expressions using deep learning approaches. In our approach, semantic features are extracted from the MEs using a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and these features have been used for matching and retrieval. We have trained the network for a classification task which determines the complexity of an ME. ME complexity has been quantified in terms of its nested depth. Based on the nested depth, we have considered three complexity classes of MEs: Simple, Medium and Complex. After training the network, outputs just before the the final fully connected layer are extracted for all the MEs. These outputs form the semantic features of MEs and are stored in a database. For a given ME query, its semantic features are computed using the trained DRNN and matched against the semantic feature database. Matching is performed based on the standard euclidean distance and top 'k' nearest matches are retrieved, where 'k' is a user-defined parameter. Our approach has been illustrated on a database of 829 MEs.

Abstract: Faithful yet compact explanations for vision models remain a challenge, as commonly used dense perturbation masks are often fragmented and overfitted, needing careful post-processing. Here, we present a training-free explanation method that replaces dense masks with smooth tunable contours. A star-convex region is parameterized by a truncated Fourier series and optimized under an extremal preserve/delete objective using the classifier gradients. The approach guarantees a single, simply connected mask, cuts the number of free parameters by orders of magnitude, and yields stable boundary updates without cleanup. Restricting solutions to low-dimensional, smooth contours makes the method robust to adversarial masking artifacts. On ImageNet classifiers, it matches the extremal fidelity of dense masks while producing compact, interpretable regions with improved run-to-run consistency. Explicit area control also enables importance contour maps, yielding a transparent fidelity-area profiles. Finally, we extend the approach to multi-contour and show how it can localize multiple objects within the same framework. Across benchmarks, the method achieves higher relevance mass and lower complexity than gradient and perturbation based baselines, with especially strong gains on self-supervised DINO models where it improves relevance mass by over 15% and maintains positive faithfulness correlations.

Abstract: By reducing resolution, coarse-grained models greatly accelerate molecular simulations, unlocking access to long-timescale phenomena, though at the expense of microscopic information. Recovering this fine-grained detail is essential for tasks that depend on atomistic accuracy, making backmapping a central challenge in molecular modeling. We introduce split-flows, a novel flow-based approach that reinterprets backmapping as a continuous-time measure transport across resolutions. Unlike existing generative strategies, split-flows establish a direct probabilistic link between resolutions, enabling expressive conditional sampling of atomistic structures and -- for the first time -- a tractable route to computing mapping entropies, an information-theoretic measure of the irreducible detail lost in coarse-graining. We demonstrate these capabilities on diverse molecular systems, including chignolin, a lipid bilayer, and alanine dipeptide, highlighting split-flows as a principled framework for accurate backmapping and systematic evaluation of coarse-grained models.

This approach characterizes $(\eps,\delta)$-QDP via hypothesis testing divergences and identifies the most informative quantum state pairs under privacy constraints. We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum learning algorithms, generalizing classical results to the case $\delta>0$. Additionally, we study privatized quantum parameter estimation, deriving tight bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.

Abstract: Large multiple antenna arrays coupled with accu- rate beamforming are essential in terahertz (THz) communi- cations to ensure link reliability. However, as the number of antennas increases, beam alignment (focusing) and beam tracking in mobile networks incur prohibitive overhead. Additionally, the near-field region expands both with the size of antenna arrays and the carrier frequency, calling for adjustments in the beamforming to account for spherical wavefront instead of the conventional planar wave assumption. In this letter, we introduce a novel beam coherence time for mobile THz networks, to drastically reduce the rate of beam updates. Then, we propose a deep learning model, relying on a simple feedforward neural network with a time-dependent input, to predict the beam coherence time and adjust the beamforming on the fly with minimal overhead. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by enabling higher data rates while reducing the overhead, especially at high (i.e., vehicular) mobility.

Abstract: Effective communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is critical for success but constrained by bandwidth, yet past approaches have been limited to complex gating mechanisms that only decide \textit{whether} to communicate, not \textit{how precisely}. Learning to optimize message precision at the bit-level is fundamentally harder, as the required discretization step breaks gradient flow. We address this by generalizing Differentiable Discrete Communication Learning (DDCL), a framework for end-to-end optimization of discrete messages. Our primary contribution is an extension of DDCL to support unbounded signals, transforming it into a universal, plug-and-play layer for any MARL architecture. We verify our approach with three key results. First, through a qualitative analysis in a controlled environment, we demonstrate \textit{how} agents learn to dynamically modulate message precision according to the informational needs of the task. Second, we integrate our variant of DDCL into four state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, showing it reduces bandwidth by over an order of magnitude while matching or exceeding task performance. Finally, we provide direct evidence for the \enquote{Bitter Lesson} in MARL communication: a simple Transformer-based policy leveraging DDCL matches the performance of complex, specialized architectures, questioning the necessity of bespoke communication designs.

Abstract: Introduction: Epigenomic datasets from high-throughput sequencing experiments are commonly summarized as genomic intervals. As the volume of this data grows, so does interest in analyzing it through deep learning. However, the heterogeneity of genomic interval data, where each dataset defines its own regions, creates barriers for machine learning methods that require consistent, discrete vocabularies. Methods: We introduce gtars-tokenizers, a high-performance library that maps genomic intervals to a predefined universe or vocabulary of regions, analogous to text tokenization in natural language processing. Built in Rust with bindings for Python, R, CLI, and WebAssembly, gtars-tokenizers implements two overlap methods (BITS and AIList) and integrates seamlessly with modern ML frameworks through Hugging Face-compatible APIs. Results: The gtars-tokenizers package achieves top efficiency for large-scale datasets, while enabling genomic intervals to be processed using standard ML workflows in PyTorch and TensorFlow without ad hoc preprocessing. This token-based approach bridges genomics and machine learning, supporting scalable and standardized analysis of interval data across diverse computational environments.

Abstract: Detecting malware, especially ransomware, is essential to securing today's interconnected ecosystems, including cloud storage, enterprise file-sharing, and database services. Training high-performing artificial intelligence (AI) detectors requires diverse datasets, which are often distributed across multiple organizations, making centralization necessary. However, centralized learning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data ownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-organizational sharing. Compounding this challenge, ransomware evolves rapidly, demanding models that are both robust and adaptable.
  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which enables multiple organizations to collaboratively train a ransomware detection model while keeping raw data local and secure. This paradigm is particularly relevant for cybersecurity companies (including both software and hardware vendors) that deploy ransomware detection or firewall systems across millions of endpoints. In such environments, data cannot be transferred outside the customer's device due to strict security, privacy, or regulatory constraints. Although FL applies broadly to malware threats, we validate the approach using the Ransomware Storage Access Patterns (RanSAP) dataset.
  Our experiments demonstrate that FL improves ransomware detection accuracy by a relative 9% over server-local models and achieves performance comparable to centralized training. These results indicate that FL offers a scalable, high-performing, and privacy-preserving framework for proactive ransomware detection across organizational and regulatory boundaries.

<title>L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3</title>

Abstract: Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance.
  To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm.
  We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) allow rigorous uncertainty quantification in deep learning, but often come at a prohibitive computational cost. We propose three different innovative architectures of partial trace-class Bayesian neural networks (PaTraC BNNs) that enable uncertainty quantification comparable to standard BNNs but use significantly fewer Bayesian parameters. These PaTraC BNNs have computational and statistical advantages over standard Bayesian neural networks in terms of speed and memory requirements. Our proposed methodology therefore facilitates reliable, robust, and scalable uncertainty quantification in neural networks. The three architectures build on trace-class neural network priors which induce an ordering of the neural network parameters, and are thus a natural choice in our framework. In a numerical simulation study, we verify the claimed benefits, and further illustrate the performance of our proposed methodology on a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to specialized, high-stakes domains like engineering, which demands rigorous evaluation of their complex reasoning capabilities. While current benchmarks assess language understanding, factual recall, mathematics or code generation, none capture the integrative reasoning central to engineering where scientific principles, quantitative modeling and practical constraints must converge. To address this gap, we introduce EngChain, a benchmark for verifiable multi-step engineering problem-solving. EngChain contains 90 problems spanning three engineering branches, organized into 9 domains and 20 distinct areas. The problems are generated from symbolic templates with a high degree of randomization to ensure diversity and eliminate the risk of contamination. With this benchmark, we move beyond final answer accuracy with a two-stage evaluation: we first quantitatively verify the numerical and semantic validity of each reasoning step and then introduce LLM-As-A-Judge, an automated system to qualitatively categorize the identified reasoning errors.

<title>Panther: A Cost-Effective Privacy-Preserving Framework for GNN Training and Inference Services in Cloud Environments</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have marked significant impact in traffic state prediction, social recommendation, knowledge-aware question answering and so on. As more and more users move towards cloud computing, it has become a critical issue to unleash the power of GNNs while protecting the privacy in cloud environments. Specifically, the training data and inference data for GNNs need to be protected from being stolen by external adversaries. Meanwhile, the financial cost of cloud computing is another primary concern for users. Therefore, although existing studies have proposed privacy-preserving techniques for GNNs in cloud environments, their additional computational and communication overhead remain relatively high, causing high financial costs that limit their widespread adoption among users.
  To protect GNN privacy while lowering the additional financial costs, we introduce Panther, a cost-effective privacy-preserving framework for GNN training and inference services in cloud environments. Technically, Panther leverages four-party computation to asynchronously executing the secure array access protocol, and randomly pads the neighbor information of GNN nodes. We prove that Panther can protect privacy for both training and inference of GNN models. Our evaluation shows that Panther reduces the training and inference time by an average of 75.28% and 82.80%, respectively, and communication overhead by an average of 52.61% and 50.26% compared with the state-of-the-art, which is estimated to save an average of 55.05% and 59.00% in financial costs (based on on-demand pricing model) for the GNN training and inference process on Google Cloud Platform.

<title>Making Interpretable Discoveries from Unstructured Data: A High-Dimensional Multiple Hypothesis Testing Approach</title>

Abstract: Social scientists are increasingly turning to unstructured datasets to unlock new empirical insights, e.g., estimating causal effects on text outcomes, measuring beliefs from open-ended survey responses. In such settings, unsupervised analysis is often of interest, in that the researcher does not want to pre-specify the objects of measurement or otherwise artificially delimit the space of measurable concepts; they are interested in discovery. This paper proposes a general and flexible framework for pursuing discovery from unstructured data in a statistically principled way. The framework leverages recent methods from the literature on machine learning interpretability to map unstructured data points to high-dimensional, sparse, and interpretable dictionaries of concepts; computes (test) statistics of these dictionary entries; and then performs selective inference on them using newly developed statistical procedures for high-dimensional exceedance control of the $k$-FWER under arbitrary dependence. The proposed framework has few researcher degrees of freedom, is fully replicable, and is cheap to implement -- both in terms of financial cost and researcher time. Applications to recent descriptive and causal analyses of unstructured data in empirical economics are explored. An open source Jupyter notebook is provided for researchers to implement the framework in their own projects.

Abstract: The character of the "AI assistant" persona generated by modern chatbot large language models influences both surface-level behavior and apparent values, beliefs, and ethics. These all affect interaction quality, perceived intelligence, and alignment with both developer and user intentions. The shaping of this persona, known as character training, is a critical component of industry post-training, yet remains effectively unstudied in the academic literature. We introduce the first open implementation of character training, leveraging Constitutional AI and a new data pipeline using synthetic introspective data to shape the assistant persona in a more effective and controlled manner than alternatives such as constraining system prompts or activation steering. Specifically, we fine-tune three popular open-weights models using 11 example personas, such as humorous, deeply caring, or even malevolent. To track the effects of our approach, we introduce a method which analyzes revealed preferences, uncovering clear and holistic changes in character. We find these changes are more robust to adversarial prompting than the above two alternatives, while also leading to more coherent and realistic generations. Finally, we demonstrate this fine-tuning has little to no effect on general capabilities as measured by common benchmarks. We describe and open-source our full post-training method, the implementation of which can be found at https://github.com/maiush/OpenCharacterTraining.

Abstract: A fundamental question in search-guided AI: what topology should guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in puzzle solving? Prior work applied topological features to guide MCTS in ARC-style tasks using grid topology -- the Laplacian spectral properties of cell connectivity -- and found no benefit. We identify the root cause: grid topology is constant across all instances. We propose measuring \emph{solution space topology} instead: the structure of valid color assignments constrained by detected pattern rules. We build this via compatibility graphs where nodes are $(cell, color)$ pairs and edges represent compatible assignments under pattern constraints.
  Our method: (1) detect pattern rules automatically with 100\% accuracy on 5 types, (2) construct compatibility graphs encoding solution space structure, (3) extract topological features (algebraic connectivity, rigidity, color structure) that vary with task difficulty, (4) integrate these features into MCTS node selection via sibling-normalized scores.
  We provide formal definitions, a rigorous selection formula, and comprehensive ablations showing that algebraic connectivity is the dominant signal. The work demonstrates that topology matters for search -- but only the \emph{right} topology. For puzzle solving, this is solution space structure, not problem space structure.

Abstract: Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) describe how Large Language Models (LLMs) make decisions, drawing on both external Context Knowledge (CK) and Parametric Knowledge (PK) stored in model weights. Understanding their interaction is key to assessing the grounding of NLEs, yet it remains underexplored. Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation, typically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a binary choice in a rank-1 subspace. This overlooks richer forms of interaction, such as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2 projection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately and use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across longer NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight instruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly represented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2 formulation. Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align strongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and Chain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing PK reliance. This work provides the first framework for systematic studies of multi-step knowledge interactions in LLMs through a richer rank-2 subspace disentanglement.

Abstract: We present a benchmark targeting a novel class of systems: semantic query processing engines. Those systems rely inherently on generative and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). They extend SQL with semantic operators, configured by natural language instructions, that are evaluated via LLMs and enable users to perform various operations on multimodal data.
  Our benchmark introduces diversity across three key dimensions: scenarios, modalities, and operators. Included are scenarios ranging from movie review analysis to medical question-answering. Within these scenarios, we cover different data modalities, including images, audio, and text. Finally, the queries involve a diverse set of operators, including semantic filters, joins, mappings, ranking, and classification operators.
  We evaluated our benchmark on three academic systems (LOTUS, Palimpzest, and ThalamusDB) and one industrial system, Google BigQuery. Although these results reflect a snapshot of systems under continuous development, our study offers crucial insights into their current strengths and weaknesses, illuminating promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously vulnerable to imperceptible perturbations. Most existing research centers on adversarial robustness (AR), which evaluates models under worst-case scenarios by examining the existence of deterministic adversarial examples (AEs). In contrast, probabilistic robustness (PR) adopts a statistical perspective, measuring the probability that predictions remain correct under stochastic perturbations. While PR is widely regarded as a practical complement to AR, dedicated training methods for improving PR are still relatively underexplored, albeit with emerging progress. Among the few PR-targeted training methods, we identify three limitations: i non-comparable evaluation protocols; ii limited comparisons to strong AT baselines despite anecdotal PR gains from AT; and iii no unified framework to compare the generalization of these methods. Thus, we introduce PRBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating improvements in PR achieved by different robustness training methods. PRBench empirically compares most common AT and PR-targeted training methods using a comprehensive set of metrics, including clean accuracy, PR and AR performance, training efficiency, and generalization error (GE). We also provide theoretical analysis on the GE of PR performance across different training methods. Main findings revealed by PRBench include: AT methods are more versatile than PR-targeted training methods in terms of improving both AR and PR performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, while PR-targeted training methods consistently yield lower GE and higher clean accuracy. A leaderboard comprising 222 trained models across 7 datasets and 10 model architectures is publicly available at https://tmpspace.github.io/PRBenchLeaderboard/.

Abstract: We provide the first proof of learning rate transfer with width in a linear multi-layer perceptron (MLP) parametrized with $\mu$P, a neural network parameterization designed to ``maximize'' feature learning in the infinite-width limit. We show that under $\mu P$, the optimal learning rate converges to a \emph{non-zero constant} as width goes to infinity, providing a theoretical explanation to learning rate transfer. In contrast, we show that this property fails to hold under alternative parametrizations such as Standard Parametrization (SP) and Neural Tangent Parametrization (NTP). We provide intuitive proofs and support the theoretical findings with extensive empirical results.

Abstract: Audio denoising is critical in signal processing, enhancing intelligibility and fidelity for applications like restoring musical recordings. This paper presents a proof-of-concept for adapting a state-of-the-art neural audio codec, the Descript Audio Codec (DAC), for music denoising. This work overcomes the limitations of traditional architectures like U-Nets by training the model on a large-scale, custom-synthesized dataset built from diverse sources. Training is guided by a multi objective loss function that combines time-domain, spectral, and signal-level fidelity metrics. Ultimately, this paper aims to present a PoC for high-fidelity, generative audio restoration.

Abstract: We present a hybrid neural network model for inferring the position of mobile robots using Channel State Information (CSI) data from a Massive MIMO system. By leveraging an existing CSI dataset, our approach integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to form a Hybrid Neural Network (HyNN) that estimates 2D robot positions. CSI readings are converted into synthetic images using the TINTO tool. The localisation solution is integrated with a robotics simulator, and the Robot Operating System (ROS), which facilitates its evaluation through heterogeneous test cases, and the adoption of state estimators like Kalman filters. Our contributions illustrate the potential of our HyNN model in achieving precise indoor localisation and navigation for mobile robots in complex environments. The study follows, and proposes, a generalisable procedure applicable beyond the specific use case studied, making it adaptable to different scenarios and datasets.

Abstract: We introduce disciplined biconvex programming (DBCP), a modeling framework for specifying and solving biconvex optimization problems. Biconvex optimization problems arise in various applications, including machine learning, signal processing, computational science, and control. Solving a biconvex optimization problem in practice usually resolves to heuristic methods based on alternate convex search (ACS), which iteratively optimizes over one block of variables while keeping the other fixed, so that the resulting subproblems are convex and can be efficiently solved. However, designing and implementing an ACS solver for a specific biconvex optimization problem usually requires significant effort from the user, which can be tedious and error-prone. DBCP extends the principles of disciplined convex programming to biconvex problems, allowing users to specify biconvex optimization problems in a natural way based on a small number of syntax rules. The resulting problem can then be automatically split and transformed into convex subproblems, for which a customized ACS solver is then generated and applied. DBCP allows users to quickly experiment with different biconvex problem formulations, without expertise in convex optimization. We implement DBCP into the open source Python package dbcp, as an extension to the famous domain specific language CVXPY for convex optimization.

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient key-value (KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation turns via shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and chat. However, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or force recomputation. We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that compresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on classical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation, adaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial calibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies in KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\times$ compression while maintaining reasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\times$ or higher for specific use cases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across benchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and MATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token eviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher compression ratios. These results support KVTC as a practical building block for memory-efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches.

Abstract: LLM agents excel in compact environments requiring deep reasoning but remain brittle when operating in broader, more complex contexts that demand robustness across diverse tools and schemas. Building bespoke environments for training is heavy, brittle, and limits progress. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed data or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks: Simia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets into diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a framework that enables RL training without real environment implementations through LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching o4-mini on $\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable agent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle implementations with flexible LLM-based simulation.

Abstract: Learning and computation of equilibria are central problems in algorithmic game theory. In this work, we introduce proximal regret, a new notion of regret based on proximal operators that lies strictly between external and swap regret. When every player employs a no-proximal-regret algorithm in a general convex game, the empirical distribution of play converges to proximal correlated equilibria (PCE), a refinement of coarse correlated equilibria. Our framework unifies several emerging notions in online learning and game theory -- such as gradient equilibrium and semicoarse correlated equilibrium -- and introduces new ones. Our main result shows that the classic Online Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm achieves an optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on proximal regret, revealing that GD, without modification, minimizes a stronger regret notion than external regret. This provides a new explanation for the empirically superior performance of gradient descent in online learning and games. We further extend our analysis to Mirror Descent in the Bregman setting and to Optimistic Gradient Descent, which yields faster convergence in smooth convex games.

Abstract: Hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) has gained considerable attention in recent decades. A seminal line of HMC research addresses the problem in two stages: first, training individual classifiers for each class, then integrating these classifiers to provide a unified set of classification results across classes while respecting the given hierarchy. In this article, we focus on the less attended second-stage question while adhering to the given class hierarchy. This involves addressing a key challenge: how to manage the hierarchical constraint and account for statistical differences in the first-stage classifier scores across different classes to make classification decisions that are optimal under a justifiable criterion. To address this challenge, we introduce a new objective function, called CATCH, to ensure reasonable classification performance. To optimize this function, we propose a decision strategy built on a novel metric, the multidimensional Local Precision Rate (mLPR), which reflects the membership chance of an object in a class given all classifier scores and the class hierarchy. Particularly, we demonstrate that, under certain conditions, transforming the classifier scores into mLPRs and comparing mLPR values for all objects against all classes can, in theory, ensure the class hierarchy and maximize CATCH. In practice, we propose an algorithm HierRank to rank estimated mLPRs under the hierarchical constraint, leading to a ranking that maximizes an empirical version of CATCH. Our approach was evaluated on a synthetic dataset and two real datasets, exhibiting superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved decision accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) conferences including NeurIPS and ICML have experienced a significant decline in peer review quality in recent years. To address this growing challenge, we introduce the Isotonic Mechanism, a computationally efficient approach to enhancing the accuracy of noisy review scores by incorporating authors' private assessments of their submissions. Under this mechanism, authors with multiple submissions are required to rank their papers in descending order of perceived quality. Subsequently, the raw review scores are calibrated based on this ranking to produce adjusted scores. We prove that authors are incentivized to truthfully report their rankings because doing so maximizes their expected utility, modeled as an additive convex function over the adjusted scores. Moreover, the adjusted scores are shown to be more accurate than the raw scores, with improvements being particularly significant when the noise level is high and the author has many submissions -- a scenario increasingly prevalent at large-scale ML/AI conferences.
  We further investigate whether submission quality information beyond a simple ranking can be truthfully elicited from authors. We establish that a necessary condition for truthful elicitation is that the mechanism be based on pairwise comparisons of the author's submissions. This result underscores the optimality of the Isotonic Mechanism, as it elicits the most fine-grained truthful information among all mechanisms we consider. We then present several extensions, including a demonstration that the mechanism maintains truthfulness even when authors have only partial rather than complete information about their submission quality. Finally, we discuss future research directions, focusing on the practical implementation of the mechanism and the further development of a theoretical framework inspired by our mechanism.

Abstract: While large machine learning models have shown remarkable performance in various domains, their training typically requires iterating for many passes over the training data. However, due to computational and memory constraints and potential privacy concerns, storing and accessing all the data is impractical in many real-world scenarios where the data arrives in a stream. In this paper, we investigate the problem of one-pass learning, in which a model is trained on sequentially arriving data without retraining on previous datapoints. Motivated by the demonstrated effectiveness of overparameterized models and the phenomenon of benign overfitting, we propose Orthogonal Recursive Fitting (ORFit), an algorithm for one-pass learning which seeks to perfectly fit each new datapoint while minimally altering the predictions on previous datapoints. ORFit updates the parameters in a direction orthogonal to past gradients, similar to orthogonal gradient descent (OGD) in continual learning. We show that, interestingly, ORFit's update leads to an operation similar to the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm in adaptive filtering but with significantly improved memory and computational efficiency, i.e., linear, instead of quadratic, in the number of parameters. To further reduce memory usage, we leverage the structure of the streaming data via an incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). We show that using the principal components is minimax optimal, i.e., it minimizes the worst-case forgetting of previous predictions for unknown future updates. Further, we prove that, for overparameterized linear models, the parameter vector obtained by ORFit matches what the standard multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) would converge to. Finally, we extend our results to the nonlinear setting for highly overparameterized models, relevant for deep learning.

<title>Algorithmic Assistance with Recommendation-Dependent Preferences</title>

Abstract: When an algorithm provides risk assessments, we typically think of them as helpful inputs to human decisions, such as when risk scores are presented to judges or doctors. However, a decision-maker may react not only to the information provided by the algorithm. The decision-maker may also view the algorithmic recommendation as a default action, making it costly for them to deviate, such as when a judge is reluctant to overrule a high-risk assessment for a defendant or a doctor fears the consequences of deviating from recommended procedures. To address such unintended consequences of algorithmic assistance, we propose a model of joint human-machine decision-making. Within this model, we consider the effect and design of algorithmic recommendations when they affect choices not just by shifting beliefs, but also by altering preferences. We motivate this assumption from institutional factors, such as a desire to avoid audits, as well as from well-established models in behavioral science that predict loss aversion relative to a reference point. We show that recommendation-dependent preferences create inefficiencies where the decision-maker is overly responsive to the recommendation. As a remedy, we discuss algorithms that strategically withhold recommendations and show how they can improve the quality of final decisions. Concretely, we prove that an intuitive algorithm achieves minimax optimality by sending recommendations only when it is confident that their implementation would improve over an unassisted baseline decision.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool to model decision-making processes. However, it relies on an exploration-exploitation trade-off that remains an open challenge for many tasks. In this work, we study neighboring state-based, model-free exploration led by the intuition that, for an early-stage agent, considering actions derived from a bounded region of nearby states may lead to better actions when exploring. We propose two algorithms that choose exploratory actions based on a survey of nearby states, and find that one of our methods, ${\rho}$-explore, consistently outperforms the Double DQN baseline in an discrete environment by 49% in terms of Eval Reward Return.

Abstract: Though denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable generation results, the low sampling efficiency of DDPMs still limits further applications. Since DDPMs can be formulated as diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs), various fast sampling methods can be derived from solving diffusion ODEs. However, we notice that previous fast sampling methods with fixed analytical form are not able to robust with the various error patterns in the noise estimated from pretrained diffusion models. In this work, we construct an error-robust Adams solver (ERA-Solver), which utilizes the implicit Adams numerical method that consists of a predictor and a corrector. Different from the traditional predictor based on explicit Adams methods, we leverage a Lagrange interpolation function as the predictor, which is further enhanced with an error-robust strategy to adaptively select the Lagrange bases with lower errors in the estimated noise. The proposed solver can be directly applied to any pretrained diffusion models, without extra training. Experiments on Cifar10, CelebA, LSUN-Church, and ImageNet 64 x 64 (conditional) datasets demonstrate that our proposed ERA-Solver achieves 3.54, 5.06, 5.02, and 5.11 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for image generation, with only 10 network evaluations.

Abstract: Due to the nature of risk management in learning applicable policies, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) has been realized as an important direction. RSRL is usually achieved by learning risk-sensitive objectives characterized by various risk measures, under the framework of distributional reinforcement learning. However, it remains unclear if the distributional Bellman operator properly optimizes the RSRL objective in the sense of risk measures. In this paper, we prove that the existing RSRL methods do not achieve unbiased optimization and cannot guarantee optimality or even improvements regarding risk measures over accumulated return distributions. To remedy this issue, we further propose a novel algorithm, namely Trajectory Q-Learning (TQL), for RSRL problems with provable policy improvement towards the optimal policy. Based on our new learning architecture, we are free to introduce a general and practical implementation for different risk measures to learn disparate risk-sensitive policies. In the experiments, we verify the learnability of our algorithm and show how our method effectively achieves better performances toward risk-sensitive objectives.

<title>APALU: A Trainable, Adaptive Activation Function for Deep Learning Networks</title>

Abstract: Activation function is a pivotal component of deep learning, facilitating the extraction of intricate data patterns. While classical activation functions like ReLU and its variants are extensively utilized, their static nature and simplicity, despite being advantageous, often limit their effectiveness in specialized tasks. The trainable activation functions also struggle sometimes to adapt to the unique characteristics of the data. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a novel trainable activation function, adaptive piecewise approximated activation linear unit (APALU), to enhance the learning performance of deep learning across a broad range of tasks. It presents a unique set of features that enable it to maintain stability and efficiency in the learning process while adapting to complex data representations. Experiments reveal significant improvements over widely used activation functions for different tasks. In image classification, APALU increases MobileNet and GoogleNet accuracy by 0.37% and 0.04%, respectively, on the CIFAR10 dataset. In anomaly detection, it improves the average area under the curve of One-CLASS Deep SVDD by 0.8% on the MNIST dataset, 1.81% and 1.11% improvements with DifferNet, and knowledge distillation, respectively, on the MVTech dataset. Notably, APALU achieves 100% accuracy on a sign language recognition task with a limited dataset. For regression tasks, APALU enhances the performance of deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks on different datasets. These improvements highlight the robustness and adaptability of APALU across diverse deep-learning applications.

<title>Enhancing Sequential Model Performance with Squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) Activation Under Data Constraints</title>

Abstract: Activation functions enable neural networks to learn complex representations by introducing non-linearities. While feedforward models commonly use rectified linear units, sequential models like recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) still rely on Sigmoid and TanH activation functions. However, these classical activation functions often struggle to model sparse patterns when trained on small sequential datasets to effectively capture temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) activation specifically tailored to enhance the learning capability of sequential models under data constraints. SST applies mathematical squaring to amplify differences between strong and weak activations as signals propagate over time, facilitating improved gradient flow and information filtering. We evaluate SST-powered LSTMs and GRUs for diverse applications, such as sign language recognition, regression, and time-series classification tasks, where the dataset is limited. Our experiments demonstrate that SST models consistently outperform RNN-based models with baseline activations, exhibiting improved test accuracy.

<title>Calibrating Bayesian Learning via Regularization, Confidence Minimization, and Selective Inference</title>

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.

<title>SST: Multi-Scale Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Experts for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting has made significant advances, including with Transformer-based models. The attention mechanism in Transformer effectively captures temporal dependencies by attending to all past inputs simultaneously. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length limits the scalability for long-range modeling. Recent state space models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative by achieving linear complexity without attention. Yet, Mamba compresses historical information into a fixed-size latent state, potentially causing information loss and limiting representational effectiveness. This raises a key research question: Can we design a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture that is both effective and efficient for time series forecasting? To address it, we adapt a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture Mambaformer, originally proposed for language modeling, to the time series domain. Preliminary experiments reveal that naively stacking Mamba and Transformer layers in Mambaformer is suboptimal for time series forecasting, due to an information interference problem. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new time series decomposition strategy that separates time series into long-range patterns and short-range variations. Then we show that Mamba excels at capturing long-term structures, while Transformer is more effective at modeling short-term dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose State Space Transformer (SST), a multi-scale hybrid model with expert modules: a Mamba expert for long-range patterns and a Transformer expert for short-term variations. SST also employs a multi-scale patching mechanism to adaptively adjust time series resolution: low resolution for long-term patterns and high resolution for short-term variations. Experiments show that SST obtains SOTA performance with linear scalability. The code is at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/SST.

However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present DiEM, a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, DiEM leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our methods, we propose and motivate an improved posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent rehearsal-free continual learning (CL) methods guided by prompts achieve strong performance on vision tasks with non-stationary data but remain resource-intensive, hindering real-world edge deployment. We introduce resource-efficient prompting (REP), which improves the computational and memory efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free continual learning methods while minimizing accuracy trade-offs. Our approach employs swift prompt selection to refine input data using a carefully provisioned model and introduces adaptive token merging (AToM) and adaptive layer dropping (ALD) for efficient prompt updates. AToM and ALD selectively skip data and model layers while preserving task-specific features during the learning of new tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrate REP's superior resource efficiency over state-of-the-art rehearsal-free CL methods.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a hardware accelerator for Transformers, optimized for on-device time-series forecasting in AIoT systems. It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy. Relevant source code is provided in the accompanying GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/tianheng-ling/TinyTransformer4TS}.

Abstract: While interpretability methods identify a model's learned concepts, they overlook the relationships between concepts that make up its abstractions and inform its ability to generalize to new data. To assess whether models' have learned human-aligned abstractions, we introduce abstraction alignment, a methodology to compare model behavior against formal human knowledge. Abstraction alignment externalizes domain-specific human knowledge as an abstraction graph, a set of pertinent concepts spanning levels of abstraction. Using the abstraction graph as a ground truth, abstraction alignment measures the alignment of a model's behavior by determining how much of its uncertainty is accounted for by the human abstractions. By aggregating abstraction alignment across entire datasets, users can test alignment hypotheses, such as which human concepts the model has learned and where misalignments recur. In evaluations with experts, abstraction alignment differentiates seemingly similar errors, improves the verbosity of existing model-quality metrics, and uncovers improvements to current human abstractions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a continuously growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of artificial intelligence. However, despite its promise, RL research is often hindered by the lack of standardization in environment and algorithm implementations. This makes it difficult for researchers to compare and build upon each other's work, slowing down progress in the field. Gymnasium is an open-source library that provides a standard API for RL environments, aiming to tackle this issue. Gymnasium's main feature is a set of abstractions that allow for wide interoperability between environments and training algorithms, making it easier for researchers to develop and test RL algorithms. In addition, Gymnasium provides a collection of easy-to-use environments, tools for easily customizing environments, and tools to ensure the reproducibility and robustness of RL research. Through this unified framework, Gymnasium significantly streamlines the process of developing and testing RL algorithms, enabling researchers to focus more on innovation and less on implementation details. By providing a standardized platform for RL research, Gymnasium helps to drive forward the field of reinforcement learning and unlock its full potential. Gymnasium is available online at https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium

Abstract: Malicious attacks on vehicular networks pose a serious threat to road safety as well as communication reliability. A major source of these threats stems from misbehaving vehicles within the network. To address this challenge, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered Misbehavior Detection System (MDS) within an edge-cloud detection framework. Specifically, we fine-tune Mistral-7B, a compact and high-performing LLM, to detect misbehavior based on Basic Safety Messages (BSM) sequences as the edge component for real-time detection, while a larger LLM deployed in the cloud validates and reinforces the edge model's detection through a more comprehensive analysis. By updating only 0.012% of the model parameters, our model, which we named MistralBSM, achieves 98% accuracy in binary classification and 96% in multiclass classification on a selected set of attacks from VeReMi dataset, outperforming LLAMA2-7B and RoBERTa. Our results validate the potential of LLMs in MDS, showing a significant promise in strengthening vehicular network security to better ensure the safety of road users.

Abstract: The integration of AI in education holds immense potential for personalizing learning experiences and transforming instructional practices. However, AI systems can inadvertently encode and amplify biases present in educational data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. As researchers have sought to understand and mitigate these biases, a growing body of work has emerged examining fairness in educational AI. These studies, though expanding rapidly, remain fragmented due to differing assumptions, methodologies, and application contexts. Moreover, existing surveys either focus on algorithmic fairness without an educational setting or emphasize educational methods while overlooking fairness. To this end, this survey provides a comprehensive systematic review of algorithmic fairness within educational AI, explicitly bridging the gap between technical fairness research and educational applications. We integrate multiple dimensions, including bias sources, fairness definitions, mitigation strategies, evaluation resources, and ethical considerations, into a harmonized, education-centered framework. In addition, we explicitly examine practical challenges such as censored or partially observed learning outcomes and the persistent difficulty in quantifying and managing the trade-off between fairness and predictive utility, enhancing the applicability of fairness frameworks to real-world educational AI systems. Finally, we outline an emerging pathway toward fair AI-driven education and by situating these technologies and practical insights within broader educational and ethical contexts, this review establishes a comprehensive foundation for advancing fairness, accountability, and inclusivity in the field of AI education.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often requires a quality dataset that we can train a policy on. However, in many situations, it is not possible to get such a dataset, nor is it easy to train a policy to perform well in the actual environment given the offline data. We propose using data distillation to train and distill a better dataset which can then be used for training a better policy model. We show that our method is able to synthesize a dataset where a model trained on it achieves similar performance to a model trained on the full dataset or a model trained using percentile behavioral cloning. Our project site is available at https://datasetdistillation4rl.github.io . We also provide our implementation at https://github.com/ggflow123/DDRL .

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly used as an effective parameterization of control policies in various learning-based control paradigms. For continuous-time optimal control problems (OCPs), which are central to many decision-making tasks, control policy learning can be cast as a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) problem wherein state and control constraints are naturally accommodated. This paper presents a NODE approach to solving continuous-time OCPs for the case of stabilizing a known constrained nonlinear system around a target state. The approach, termed Lyapunov-NODE control (L-NODEC), uses a novel Lyapunov loss formulation that incorporates an exponentially-stabilizing control Lyapunov function to learn a state-feedback neural control policy, bridging the gap of solving continuous-time OCPs via NODEs with stability guarantees. The proposed Lyapunov loss allows L-NODEC to guarantee exponential stability of the controlled system, as well as its adversarial robustness to perturbations to the initial state. The performance of L-NODEC is illustrated in two problems, including a dose delivery problem in plasma medicine. In both cases, L-NODEC effectively stabilizes the controlled system around the target state despite perturbations to the initial state and reduces the inference time necessary to reach the target.

Abstract: We explore the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. A diffusion model converts noise into structured data by reinstating, imperfectly, information that is erased when data was diffused to noise. This information is stored in a neural network during training. We quantify this information by introducing a measure called neural entropy, which is related to the total entropy produced by diffusion. Neural entropy is a function of not just the data distribution, but also the diffusive process itself. Measurements of neural entropy on a few simple image diffusion models reveal that they are extremely efficient at compressing large ensembles of structured data.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a crucial computational tool for researchers to understand and engineer molecular structure and function in areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and material design. Despite their utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality of molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) has recently emerged as a "human-in-the-loop" strategy for efficiently navigating hyper-dimensional molecular systems. By providing an immersive 3D environment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular simulations running on high-performance computing architectures, iMD-VR enables researchers to reach out and guide molecular conformational dynamics, in order to efficiently explore complex, high-dimensional molecular systems. Moreover, iMD-VR simulations generate rich datasets that capture human experts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper explores the use of researcher-generated iMD-VR datasets to train AI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL enables agents to mimic complex behaviours from expert demonstrations, circumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. In this article, we review IL across robotics and Multi-agents systems domains which are comparable to iMD-VR, and discuss how iMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models to interact with MD simulations. We then illustrate the applications of these ideas through a proof-of-principle study where iMD-VR data was used to train a CNN network on a simple molecular manipulation task; namely, threading a small molecule through a nanotube pore. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment human expertise in navigating vast molecular conformational spaces.

Abstract: Epilepsy represents the most prevalent neurological disease in the world. One-third of people suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) exhibit drug resistance, urging the need to develop new treatments. A key part in anti-seizure medication (ASM) development is the capability of detecting and quantifying epileptic seizures occurring in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which is crucial for treatment efficacy evaluation. In this study, we introduced a seizure detection pipeline based on deep learning models applied to raw EEG signals. This pipeline integrates: a new pre-processing technique which segments continuous raw EEG signals without prior distinction between seizure and seizure-free activities; a post-processing algorithm developed to reassemble EEG segments and allow the identification of seizures start/end; and finally, a new evaluation procedure based on a strict seizure events comparison between predicted and real labels. Models training have been performed using a data splitting strategy which addresses the potential for data leakage. We demonstrated the fundamental differences between a seizure classification and a seizure detection task and showed the differences in performance between the two tasks. Finally, we demonstrated the generalization capabilities across species of our best architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network and a Transformer encoder. The model was trained on animal EEGs and tested on human EEGs with a F1-score of 93% on a balanced Bonn dataset.

Abstract: A major limitation of machine learning (ML) prediction models is that they recover associational, rather than causal, predictive relationships between variables. In high-stakes automation applications of ML this is problematic, as the model often learns spurious, non-causal associations. This paper proposes mechanism learning, a simple method which uses causally weighted Gaussian Mixture Models (CW-GMMs) to deconfound observational data such that any appropriate ML model is forced to learn predictive relationships between effects and their causes (reverse causal inference), despite the potential presence of multiple unknown and unmeasured confounding. Effect variables can be very high-dimensional, and the predictive relationship nonlinear, as is common in ML applications. This novel method is widely applicable, the only requirement is the existence of a set of mechanism variables mediating the cause (prediction target) and effect (feature data), which is independent of the (unmeasured) confounding variables. We test our method on fully synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that it can discover reliable, unbiased, causal ML predictors where by contrast, the same ML predictor trained naively using classical supervised learning on the original observational data, is heavily biased by spurious associations. We provide code to implement the results in the paper, online.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties have achieved significant success in modeling complex dynamic systems and molecular properties. However, their expressiveness ability is limited by: (1) Existing methods often overlook the over-smoothing issue caused by traditional GNN models, as well as the gradient explosion or vanishing problems in deep GNNs. (2) Most models operate on first-order information, neglecting that the real world often consists of second-order systems, which further limits the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{Du}al \textbf{S}econd-order \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}rdinary Differential Equation (\method{}) for equivariant representation. Specifically, \method{} apply the dual second-order equivariant graph ordinary differential equations (Graph ODEs) on graph embeddings and node coordinates, simultaneously. Theoretically, we first prove that \method{} maintains the equivariant property. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that \method{} effectively alleviates the over-smoothing problem in both feature representation and coordinate update. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed \method{} mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem, facilitating the training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} compared to baselines.

Abstract: Time series classification is a relevant step supporting decision-making processes in various domains, and deep neural models have shown promising performance in this respect. Despite significant advancements in deep learning, the theoretical understanding of how and why complex architectures function remains limited, prompting the need for more interpretable models. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to deep learning. While KAN-related research is significantly rising, to date, the study of KAN architectures for time series classification has been limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and robust exploration of the KAN architecture for time series classification utilising 117 datasets from UCR benchmark archive, from multiple different domains. More specifically, we investigate a) the transferability of reference architectures designed for regression to classification tasks, b) identifying the hyperparameter and implementation configurations for an architecture that best generalizes across 117 datasets, c) the associated complexity trade-offs and d) evaluate KANs interpretability. Our results demonstrate that (1) the Efficient KAN outperforms MLPs in both performance and training times, showcasing its suitability for classification tasks. (2) Efficient KAN exhibits greater stability than the original KAN across grid sizes, depths, and layer configurations, especially when lower learning rates are employed. (3) KAN achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as HIVE-COTE2 and InceptionTime, while maintaining smaller architectures and faster training times, highlighting its favorable balance of performance and transparency. (4) The interpretability of the KAN model, as confirmed by SHAP analysis, reinforces its capacity for transparent decision-making.

Abstract: "Machine unlearning" is a popular proposed solution for mitigating the existence of content in an AI model that is problematic for legal or moral reasons, including privacy, copyright, safety, and more. For example, unlearning is often invoked as a solution for removing the effects of specific information from a generative-AI model's parameters, e.g., a particular individual's personal data or the inclusion of copyrighted content in the model's training data. Unlearning is also proposed as a way to prevent a model from generating targeted types of information in its outputs, e.g., generations that closely resemble a particular individual's data or reflect the concept of "Spiderman." Both of these goals--the targeted removal of information from a model and the targeted suppression of information from a model's outputs--present various technical and substantive challenges. We provide a framework for ML researchers and policymakers to think rigorously about these challenges, identifying several mismatches between the goals of unlearning and feasible implementations. These mismatches explain why unlearning is not a general-purpose solution for circumscribing generative-AI model behavior in service of broader positive impact.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of foundation modelslarge-scale neural networks trained on diverse, extensive datasetshas revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling unprecedented advancements across domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific discovery. However, the substantial parameter count of these models, often reaching billions or trillions, poses significant challenges in adapting them to specific downstream tasks. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly promising approach for mitigating these challenges, offering a parameter-efficient mechanism to fine-tune foundation models with minimal computational overhead. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of LoRA techniques beyond large Language Models to general foundation models, including recent techniques foundations, emerging frontiers and applications of low-rank adaptation across multiple domains. Finally, this survey discusses key challenges and future research directions in theoretical understanding, scalability, and robustness. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with efficient foundation model adaptation.

Abstract: Graph clustering plays a crucial role in graph representation learning but often faces challenges in achieving feature-space diversity. While Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN) leverage modularity maximization and collapse regularization to ensure structural separation, they lack explicit mechanisms for feature-space separation, assignment dispersion, and assignment-confidence control. We address this limitation by proposing Deep Modularity Networks with Diversity-Preserving Regularization (DMoN-DPR), which introduces three novel regularization terms: distance-based for inter-cluster separation, variance-based for per-cluster assignment dispersion, and an assignment-entropy penalty with a small positive weight, encouraging more confident assignments gradually. Our method significantly enhances label-based clustering metrics on feature-rich benchmark datasets (paired two-tailed t-test, $p\leq0.05$), demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating diversity-preserving regularizations in creating meaningful and interpretable clusters.

Abstract: Gradient descent for matrix factorization exhibits an implicit bias toward approximately low-rank solutions. While existing theories often assume the boundedness of iterates, empirically the bias persists even with unbounded sequences. This reflects a dynamic where factors develop low-rank structure while their magnitudes increase, tending to align with certain directions. To capture this behavior in a stable way, we introduce a new factorization model: $X\approx UDV^\top$, where $U$ and $V$ are constrained within norm balls, while $D$ is a diagonal factor allowing the model to span the entire search space. Experiments show that this model consistently exhibits a strong implicit bias, yielding truly (rather than approximately) low-rank solutions. Extending the idea to neural networks, we introduce a new model featuring constrained layers and diagonal components that achieves competitive performance on various regression and classification tasks while producing lightweight, low-rank representations.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) enables agents to learn automatically and on-the-fly from their interactive experiences. However, a major challenge in scaling up ICRL is the lack of scalable task collections. To address this, we propose the procedurally generated tabular Markov Decision Processes, named AnyMDP. Through a carefully designed randomization process, AnyMDP is capable of generating high-quality tasks on a large scale while maintaining relatively low structural biases. To facilitate efficient meta-training at scale, we further introduce decoupled policy distillation and induce prior information in the ICRL framework. Our results demonstrate that, with a sufficiently large scale of AnyMDP tasks, the proposed model can generalize to tasks that were not considered in the training set through versatile in-context learning paradigms. The scalable task set provided by AnyMDP also enables a more thorough empirical investigation of the relationship between data distribution and ICRL performance. We further show that the generalization of ICRL potentially comes at the cost of increased task diversity and longer adaptation periods. This finding carries critical implications for scaling robust ICRL capabilities, highlighting the necessity of diverse and extensive task design, and prioritizing asymptotic performance over few-shot adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://github.com/Skilteee/DiZO.

Abstract: Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

Abstract: A neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) is an SDE with drift and diffusion terms parametrized by neural networks. The training procedure for neural SDEs consists of optimizing the SDE vector field (neural network) parameters to minimize the expected value of an objective functional on infinite-dimensional path-space. Existing training techniques focus on methods to efficiently compute path-wise gradients of the objective functional with respect to these parameters, then pair this with Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the gradient expectation. In this work we introduce a novel training technique which bypasses and improves upon this Monte-Carlo simulation; we extend results in the theory of Wiener space cubature to approximate the expected objective functional value by a weighted sum of functional evaluations of deterministic ODE solutions. Our main mathematical contribution enabling this approximation is an extension of cubature bounds to the setting of Lipschitz-nonlinear functionals acting on path-space. Our resulting constructive algorithm allows for more computationally efficient training along several lines. First, it circumvents Brownian motion simulation and enables the use of efficient parallel ODE solvers, thus decreasing the complexity of path-functional evaluation. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, we show that the number of paths required to achieve a given (expected loss functional oracle value) approximation can be reduced in this deterministic cubature regime. Specifically, we show that under reasonable regularity assumptions we can observe a O(1/n) convergence rate, where n is the number of path evaluations; in contrast with the standard O(1/sqrt(n)) rate of naive Monte-Carlo or the O(log(n)^d /n) rate of quasi-Monte-Carlo.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is essential for power management and stability in smart grids. This is mainly achieved via advanced metering infrastructure, where smart meters (SMs) record household energy data. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods are often employed for load forecasting, but require data sharing, which raises data privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) can address this issue by running distributed ML models at local SMs without data exchange. However, current FL-based approaches struggle to achieve efficient load forecasting due to imbalanced data distribution across heterogeneous SMs. This paper presents a novel personalized federated learning (PFL) method for high-quality load forecasting in metering networks. A meta-learning-based strategy is developed to address data heterogeneity at local SMs in the collaborative training of local load forecasting models. Moreover, to minimize the load forecasting delays in our PFL model, we study a new latency optimization problem based on optimal resource allocation at SMs. A theoretical convergence analysis is also conducted to provide insights into FL design for federated load forecasting. Extensive simulations from real-world datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches regarding better load forecasting and reduced operational latency costs.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in discrete-state spaces using discrete diffusion models. While posterior sampling methods for continuous diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, analogous methods for discrete diffusion models remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a principled plug-and-play discrete diffusion posterior sampling algorithm based on split Gibbs sampling, which we call SGDD. Our algorithm enables reward-guided generation and solving inverse problems in discrete-state spaces. We demonstrate the convergence of SGDD to the target posterior distribution and verify this through controlled experiments on synthetic benchmarks. Our method enjoys state-of-the-art posterior sampling performance on a range of benchmarks for discrete data, including DNA sequence design, discrete image inverse problems, and music infilling, achieving more than 30% improved performance compared to existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/chuwd19/Split-Gibbs-Discrete-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling.

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used in decision-making and recommendation systems, where they typically rely on the assumption of a static data distribution between training and deployment. However, real-world deployment environments often violate this assumption. Users who receive negative outcomes may adapt their features to meet model criteria, i.e., recourse action. These adaptive behaviors create shifts in the data distribution and when models are retrained on this shifted data, a feedback loop emerges: user behavior influences the model, and the updated model in turn reshapes future user behavior. Despite its importance, this bidirectional interaction between users and models has received limited attention. In this work, we develop a general framework to model user strategic behaviors and their interactions with decision-making systems under resource constraints and competitive dynamics. Both the theoretical and empirical analyses show that user recourse behavior tends to push logistic and MLP models toward increasingly higher decision standards, resulting in higher recourse costs and less reliable recourse actions over time. To mitigate these challenges, we propose two methods--Fair-top-k and Dynamic Continual Learning (DCL)--which significantly reduce recourse cost and improve model robustness. Our findings draw connections to economic theories, highlighting how algorithmic decision-making can unintentionally reinforce a higher standard and generate endogenous barriers to entry.

Abstract: An important aspect of text mining involves information retrieval in form of discovery of semantic themes (topics) from documents using topic modelling. While generative topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) elegantly model topics as probability distributions and are useful in identifying latent topics from large document corpora with minimal supervision, they suffer from difficulty in topic interpretability and reduced performance in shorter texts. Here we propose a novel Multivariate Gaussian Topic Model (MGTM). In this approach topics are presented as Multivariate Gaussian Distributions and documents as Gaussian Mixture Models. Applying EM algorithm on a document corpus, the various constituent Multivariate Gaussian distributions corresponding to the latent topics and their respective parameters are identified. Analysis of the parameters of each distribution helps identify the respective topic keywords, and from these key-words topic annotations are carried out. This approach is applied on 20 newsgroups dataset to demonstrate the interpretability benefits vis-`a-vis 4 other benchmark models. The effectiveness of this model in capturing the semantic theme of the topics with high interpretability is examined by calculating the topic coherence and comparing the coherence values with benchmark models. This model achieves a highest mean topic coherence (0.7) and median topic coherence (0.76) vis-`a-vis the benchmark models, demonstrating high effectiveness in identifying interpretable, semantically coherent topics.

Abstract: GraphRAG enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality answers for user questions by retrieving related facts from external knowledge graphs. However, current GraphRAG methods are primarily evaluated on and overly tailored for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) benchmarks, which are biased towards a few specific question patterns and do not reflect the diversity of real-world questions. To better evaluate GraphRAG methods, we propose a complete four-class taxonomy to categorize the basic patterns of knowledge graph questions and use it to create PolyBench, a new GraphRAG benchmark encompassing a comprehensive set of graph questions. With the new benchmark, we find that existing GraphRAG methods fall short in effectiveness (i.e., quality of the generated answers) and/or efficiency (i.e., response time or token usage) because they adopt either a fixed graph traversal strategy or free-form exploration by LLMs for fact retrieval. However, different question patterns require distinct graph traversal strategies and context formation. To facilitate better retrieval, we propose PolyG, an adaptive GraphRAG approach by decomposing and categorizing the questions according to our proposed question taxonomy. Built on top of a unified interface and execution engine, PolyG dynamically prompts an LLM to generate a graph database query to retrieve the context for each decomposed basic question. Compared with SOTA GraphRAG methods, PolyG achieves a higher win rate in generation quality and has a low response latency and token cost. Our code and benchmark are open-source at https://github.com/Liu-rj/PolyG.

Abstract: We introduce a new graph diffusion model for small molecule generation, DMol, which outperforms the state-of-the-art DiGress model in terms of validity by roughly 1.5% across all benchmarking datasets while reducing the number of diffusion steps by at least 10-fold, and the running time to roughly one half. The performance improvements are a result of a careful change in the objective function and a graph noise scheduling approach which, at each diffusion step, allows one to only change a subset of nodes of varying size in the molecule graph. Another relevant property of the method is that it can be easily combined with junction-tree-like graph representations that arise by compressing a collection of relevant ring structures into supernodes. Unlike classical junction-tree techniques that involve VAEs and require complicated reconstruction steps, compressed DMol directly performs graph diffusion on a graph that compresses only a carefully selected set of frequent carbon rings into supernodes, which results in straightforward sample generation. This compressed DMol method offers additional validity improvements over generic DMol of roughly 2%, increases the novelty of the method, and further improves the running time due to reductions in the graph size.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI encompasses many aspirational aspects for aligning AI systems with human values, including fairness, privacy, robustness, explainability, and uncertainty quantification. Ultimately the goal of Trustworthy AI research is to achieve all aspects simultaneously. However, efforts to enhance one aspect often introduce unintended trade-offs that negatively impact others. In this position paper, we review notable approaches to these five aspects and systematically consider every pair, detailing the negative interactions that can arise. For example, applying differential privacy to model training can amplify biases, undermining fairness. Drawing on these findings, we take the position that current research practices of improving one or two aspects in isolation are insufficient. Instead, research on Trustworthy AI must account for interactions between aspects and adopt a holistic view across all relevant axes at once. To illustrate our perspective, we provide guidance on how practitioners can work towards integrated trust, examples of how interactions affect the financial industry, and alternative views.

<title>Decoupling Contrastive Decoding: Robust Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities on complex multimodal understanding tasks, they still suffer from the notorious hallucination issue: generating outputs misaligned with obvious visual or factual evidence. Currently, training-based solutions, like direct preference optimization (DPO), leverage paired preference data to suppress hallucinations. However, they risk sacrificing general reasoning capabilities due to the likelihood displacement. Meanwhile, training-free solutions, like contrastive decoding, achieve this goal by subtracting the estimated hallucination pattern from a distorted input. Yet, these handcrafted perturbations (e.g., add noise to images) may poorly capture authentic hallucination patterns. To avoid these weaknesses of existing methods, and realize robust hallucination mitigation (i.e., maintaining general reasoning performance), we propose a novel framework: Decoupling Contrastive Decoding (DCD). Specifically, DCD decouples the learning of positive and negative samples in preference datasets, and trains separate positive and negative image projections within the MLLM. The negative projection implicitly models real hallucination patterns, which enables vision-aware negative images in the contrastive decoding inference stage. Our DCD alleviates likelihood displacement by avoiding pairwise optimization and generalizes robustly without handcrafted degradation. Extensive ablations across hallucination benchmarks and general reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DCD, i.e., it matches DPO's hallucination suppression while preserving general capabilities and outperforms the handcrafted contrastive decoding methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF -- both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation -- and open questions for the field.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive formulation of Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA) and evaluates its effectiveness across parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. EDLA is a biologically inspired learning algorithm that provides an alternative to conventional backpropagation for training artificial neural networks. EDLA employs a single global error signal that diffuses across networks composed of paired positive and negative sublayers, eliminating traditional layer-wise error backpropagation. This study evaluates EDLA's effectiveness using benchmark tasks, such as parity check, regression, and image classification, by systematically varying the neuron count, network depth, and learning rates to assess its performance comprehensively. The experimental results demonstrate that EDLA achieves consistently high accuracy across multiple benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness as a learning algorithm for neural networks. The choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth significantly influences EDLA's efficiency and convergence speed. Analysis of internal network representations reveals meaningful feature extraction capabilities, and the network's overall performance is found to be competitive with networks trained via conventional backpropagation, especially in shallow architectures. This study introduces EDLA, a biologically plausible alternative to traditional backpropagation previously underrecognized due to language barriers. By reformulating EDLA, systematically evaluating its performance, and presenting empirical evidence of its effectiveness, this study increases the visibility and accessibility of EDLA and contributes to biologically inspired training methodologies.

Abstract: We introduce a novel generative framework for functions by integrating Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Transformer-based hypernetworks into latent variable models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables, addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming: a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining. We validate our approach across multiple modalities, demonstrating improved scalability, expressiveness, and generalization over existing INR-based generative models. Our findings establish a unified and flexible framework for learning structured function representations.

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale, high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN), Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation, followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and the need for advanced computational techniques in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic diseases. This study was conducted as part of Big Data class project under the supervision of our professors Mr. Abderrahmane EZ-ZAHOUT and Mr. Abdessamad ESSAIDI.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show how different machine learning tools on the Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{P}_d$ of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices can be united under a probabilistic framework. For this, we will need several Gaussian distributions defined on $\mathcal{P}_d$. We will show how popular classifiers on $\mathcal{P}_d$ can be reinterpreted as Bayes Classifiers using these Gaussian distributions. These distributions will also be used for outlier detection and dimension reduction. By showing that those distributions are pervasive in the tools used on $\mathcal{P}_d$, we allow for other machine learning tools to be extended to $\mathcal{P}_d$.

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences, yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or inadequately overlapping supports -- the density-chasm and the support-chasm problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We design $\textbf{D}^3\textbf{RE}$, a unified framework for \textbf{robust}, \textbf{stable} and \textbf{efficient} density ratio estimation. We propose the dequantified diffusion bridge interpolant (DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the proposed dequantified Schr{\"o}dinger bridge interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: In many scenarios of binary classification, only positive instances are provided in the training data, leaving the rest of the data unlabeled. This setup, known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, is addressed here with a network flow-based method which utilizes pairwise similarities between samples. The method we propose here, 2-HNC, leverages Hochbaum's Normalized Cut (HNC) and the set of solutions it provides by solving a parametric minimum cut problem. The set of solutions, that are nested partitions of the samples into two sets, correspond to varying tradeoff values between the two goals: high intra-similarity inside the sets and low inter-similarity between the two sets. This nested sequence is utilized here to deliver a ranking of unlabeled samples by their likelihood of being negative. Building on this insight, our method, 2-HNC, proceeds in two stages. The first stage generates this ranking without assuming any negative labels, using a problem formulation that is constrained only on positive labeled samples. The second stage augments the positive set with likely-negative samples and recomputes the classification. The final label prediction selects among all generated partitions in both stages, the one that delivers a positive class proportion, closest to a prior estimate of this quantity, which is assumed to be given. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real datasets show that 2-HNC yields strong performance and often surpasses existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time series in the context of interpretability of a TSC - a Time Series Classifier. Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to text and image data, are not intuitively under- standable to humans. These metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications - how many segments they contain - and to their loyalty - how likely they are to maintain the classification of the original time series. We focus on simplifications that select a subset of the original data points, and show that these typically have high Shapley value, thereby aiding interpretability. We employ these metrics to experimentally evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to short or long. We subsequently perform a human-grounded evaluation with forward simulation, that confirms also the practical utility of the introduced metrics to evaluate the use of simplifications in the context of inter- pretability of TSC. Our findings are summarized in a framework for deciding, for a given TSC, if the various simplifications are likely to aid in its interpretability.

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning. We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP), while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set. Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}| t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here, $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many applications, including challenging reasoning problems via chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) techniques that generate ``thinking tokens'' before answering the questions. While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$ steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state, which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs, without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths simultaneously.

Abstract: While Transformer self-attention offers strong parallelism, the Key-Value (KV) cache grows linearly with sequence length and becomes a bottleneck for inference efficiency. Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to compress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache size along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of self-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge temporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the compressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask is proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with inference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation, speech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate that MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage. For example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x speedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA, while maintaining translation quality.

Abstract: What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.
  In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density, rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.
  Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and simulation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has provided users with a wide range of well-trained models to address diverse prompts. When selecting a model for a given prompt, users should weigh not only its performance but also its service cost. However, existing model-selection methods typically emphasize performance while overlooking cost differences. In this paper, we introduce PromptWise, an online learning framework that assigns prompts to generative models in a cost-aware manner. PromptWise estimates prompt-model compatibility to select the least expensive model expected to deliver satisfactory outputs. Unlike standard contextual bandits that make a one-shot decision per prompt, PromptWise employs a cost-aware bandit structure that allows sequential model assignments per prompt to reduce total service cost. Through numerical experiments on tasks such as code generation and translation, we demonstrate that PromptWise can achieve performance comparable to baseline selection methods while incurring substantially lower costs. The code is available at: github.com/yannxiaoyanhu/PromptWise.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date.

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space, finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii) it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings. We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is essential.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models. This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples. Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5 percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while generating more diverse and robust solutions.

<title>TiRex: Zero-Shot Forecasting Across Long and Short Horizons with Enhanced In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective for tasks with known underlying symmetries. However, optimizing equivariant networks can be tricky and best training practices are less established than for standard networks. In particular, recent works have found small training benefits from relaxing equivariance constraints. This raises the question: do equivariance constraints introduce fundamental obstacles to optimization? Or do they simply require different hyperparameter tuning? In this work, we investigate this question through a theoretical analysis of the loss landscape geometry. We focus on networks built using permutation representations, which we can view as a subset of unconstrained MLPs. Importantly, we show that the parameter symmetries of the unconstrained model has nontrivial effects on the loss landscape of the equivariant subspace and under certain conditions can provably prevent learning of the global minima. Further, we empirically demonstrate in such cases, relaxing to an unconstrained MLP can sometimes solve the issue. Interestingly, the weights eventually found via relaxation corresponds to a different choice of group representation in the hidden layer. From this, we draw 3 key takeaways. (1) By viewing the unconstrained version of an architecture, we can uncover hidden parameter symmetries which were broken by choice of constraint enforcement (2) Hidden symmetries give important insights on loss landscapes and can induce critical points and even minima (3) Hidden symmetry induced minima can sometimes be escaped by constraint relaxation and we observe the network jumps to a different choice of constraint enforcement. Effective equivariance relaxation may require rethinking the fixed choice of group representation in the hidden layers.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably $\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our analysis is carried out in the simplified single-agent setting, which allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H), allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs (1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. Our code can be found on https://github.com/divelab/E2H-Reasoning.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used in robotics and autonomous driving. The pipeline significantly reduces the computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation. Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to $3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic framework that views learning as universal prediction under log loss, characterized through regret bounds. Central to the framework is an effective notion of architecture-based model complexity, defined by the probability mass or volume of models in the vicinity of the data-generating process, or its projection on the model class. This volume is related to spectral properties of the expected Hessian or the Fisher Information Matrix, leading to tractable approximations. We argue that successful architectures possess a broad complexity range, enabling learning in highly over-parameterized model classes. The framework sheds light on the role of inductive biases, the effectiveness of stochastic gradient descent, and phenomena such as flat minima. It unifies online, batch, supervised, and generative settings, and applies across the stochastic-realizable and agnostic regimes. Moreover, it provides insights into the success of modern machine-learning architectures, such as deep neural networks and transformers, suggesting that their broad complexity range naturally arises from their layered structure. These insights open the door to the design of alternative architectures with potentially comparable or even superior performance.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. Although current table-native ICL architectures are architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, their exclusive training on synthetic data limits their ability to fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. At the other end of the spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark. Code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-rpt-1-oss.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that, counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.

Abstract: Forecasting electricity demand is increasingly challenging as energy systems become more decentralized and intertwined with renewable sources. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm to model spatial dependencies in load data while accommodating complex non-stationarities. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that integrates graph-based forecasting with attention mechanisms and ensemble aggregation strategies to enhance both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Several GNN architectures -- including Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE, APPNP, and Graph Attention Networks -- are systematically evaluated on synthetic, regional (France), and fine-grained (UK) datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that graph-aware models consistently outperform conventional baselines such as Feed Forward Neural Networks and foundation models like TiREX. Furthermore, attention layers provide valuable insights into evolving spatial interactions driven by meteorological and seasonal dynamics. Ensemble aggregation, particularly through bottom-up expert combination, further improves robustness under heterogeneous data conditions. Overall, the study highlights the complementarity between structural modeling, interpretability, and robustness, and discusses the trade-offs between accuracy, model complexity, and transparency in graph-based electricity load forecasting.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a framework for decision-making under distributional uncertainty, yet its effectiveness can be compromised by outliers in the training data. This paper introduces a principled approach to simultaneously address both challenges. We focus on optimizing Wasserstein-1 DRO objectives for generalized linear models with convex Lipschitz loss functions, where an $\epsilon$-fraction of the training data is adversarially corrupted. Our primary contribution lies in a novel modeling framework that integrates robustness against training data contamination with robustness against distributional shifts, alongside an efficient algorithm inspired by robust statistics to solve the resulting optimization problem. We prove that our method achieves an estimation error of $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for the true DRO objective value using only the contaminated data under the bounded covariance assumption. This work establishes the first rigorous guarantees, supported by efficient computation, for learning under the dual challenges of data contamination and distributional shifts.

Abstract: Scientific progress in Earth science depends on integrating data across the planet's interconnected spheres. However, the accelerating volume and fragmentation of multi-sphere knowledge and data have surpassed human analytical capacity. This creates a major bottleneck for discovery, especially in climate science. To address this challenge, we introduce EarthLink, the first self-evolving AI agent system designed as an interactive "copilot" for Earth scientists. Through natural language interaction, EarthLink automates the entire research workflow by integrating planning, code execution, data analysis, and physical reasoning into a unified process that directly addresses this limitation. Beyond efficiency, it exhibits human-like cross-disciplinary analytical ability and achieves proficiency comparable to a junior researcher in expert evaluations on core large-scale climate tasks, including model-observation comparison and climate change understanding. When tasked with an open scientific problem, specifically the discovery of precursors of the Atlantic Ni\~no, EarthLink autonomously developed a research strategy, identified sources of predictability, verified its hypotheses with available data, and proposed a physically consistent mechanism. These emerging capabilities enable a new human-AI research paradigm. Scientists can focus on value and result judgments, while AI systems handle complex data analysis and knowledge integration. This accelerates the pace and breadth of discovery in Earth sciences. The system is accessible at our website https://earthlink.intern-ai.org.cn.

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and (iii) deep-operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex dynamics while learning more effectively. In addition to reviewing recent literature, this work also presents several comparative evaluations that clarify central characteristics of KAN modeling and hint at their potential implications for real-world applications. Finally, this review identifies critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development, particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

Abstract: A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST (Goldman et. al., 2023) as the encoder and MolForge (Ucak et. al., 2023) as the decoder, leveraging additional training data to enhance performance. We also threshold the probabilities of each fingerprint bit to focus on the presence of substructures. This results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 31% / top-10 40% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra in MassSpecGym (Bushuiev et. al., 2024). We position this as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

<title>FlexQ: Efficient Post-training INT6 Quantization for LLM Serving via Algorithm-System Co-Design</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration. In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA family models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.1 on WikiText2. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.

<title>Cold-Start Active Preference Learning in Socio-Economic Domains</title>

Abstract: Active preference learning offers an efficient approach to modeling preferences, but it is hindered by the cold-start problem, which leads to a marked decline in performance when no initial labeled data are available. While cold-start solutions have been proposed for domains such as vision and text, the cold-start problem in active preference learning remains largely unexplored, underscoring the need for practical, effective methods. Drawing inspiration from established practices in social and economic research, the proposed method initiates learning with a self-supervised phase that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate initial pseudo-labels. This process produces a \say{warmed-up} model based solely on the data's intrinsic structure, without requiring expert input. The model is then refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a simulated noisy oracle for labels. Experiments conducted on various socio-economic datasets, including those related to financial credibility, career success rate, and socio-economic status, consistently show that the PCA-driven approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that start without prior information. This work thus provides a computationally efficient and straightforward solution that effectively addresses the cold-start problem.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. Our code is available at https://github.com/MichaelMaiii/SynBrain.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://jayneelparekh.github.io/learn-to-steer/

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

<title>Disentangled Lottery Tickets: Identifying and Assembling Core and Specialist Subnetworks</title>

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that within large neural networks, there exist sparse, trainable "winning tickets" capable of matching the performance of the full model, but identifying them through Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) is computationally expensive. Recent work introduced COLT, an accelerator that discovers a "consensus" subnetwork by intersecting masks from models trained on disjoint data partitions; however, this approach discards all non-overlapping weights, assuming they are unimportant. This paper challenges that assumption and proposes the Disentangled Lottery Ticket (DiLT) Hypothesis, which posits that the intersection mask represents a universal, task-agnostic "core" subnetwork, while the non-overlapping difference masks capture specialized, task-specific "specialist" subnetworks. A framework is developed to identify and analyze these components using the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance to quantify functional similarity between layer representations and reveal modular structures through spectral clustering. Experiments on ImageNet and fine-grained datasets such as Stanford Cars, using ResNet and Vision Transformer architectures, show that the "core" ticket provides superior transfer learning performance, the "specialist" tickets retain domain-specific features enabling modular assembly, and the full re-assembled "union" ticket outperforms COLT - demonstrating that non-consensus weights play a critical functional role. This work reframes pruning as a process for discovering modular, disentangled subnetworks rather than merely compressing models.

Abstract: Distributed learning enables scalable model training over decentralized data, but remains hindered by Byzantine faults and high communication costs. While both challenges have been studied extensively in isolation, their interplay has received limited attention. Prior work has shown that naively combining communication compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation can severely weaken resilience to faulty nodes. The current state-of-the-art, Byz-DASHA-PAGE, leverages a momentum-based variance reduction scheme to counteract the negative effect of compression noise on Byzantine robustness. In this work, we introduce RoSDHB, a new algorithm that integrates classical Polyak momentum with a coordinated compression strategy. Theoretically, RoSDHB matches the convergence guarantees of Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard $(G,B)$-gradient dissimilarity model, while relying on milder assumptions and requiring less memory and communication per client. Empirically, RoSDHB demonstrates stronger robustness while achieving substantial communication savings compared to Byz-DASHA-PAGE.

Abstract: This study proposes and validates a Federated Learning (FL) framework to proactively identify at-risk students while preserving data privacy. Persistently high dropout rates in distance education remain a pressing institutional challenge. Using the large-scale OULAD dataset, we simulate a privacy-centric scenario where models are trained on early academic performance and digital engagement patterns. Our work investigates the practical trade-offs between model complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and the impact of local data balancing. The resulting federated model achieves strong predictive power (ROC AUC approximately 85%), demonstrating that FL is a practical and scalable solution for early-warning systems that inherently respects student data sovereignty.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common DNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models. NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized executables, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 72%. NeuroDeX offers a more comprehensive and effective solution compared to previous DNN executables decompilers.

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Abstract: Scaling laws have emerged as a unifying lens for understanding and guiding the training of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies predominantly focus on the final-step loss, leaving open whether the entire loss dynamics obey similar laws and, crucially, how the learning rate schedule (LRS) shapes them. We address these gaps in a controlled theoretical setting by analyzing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a power-law kernel regression model. The key insight is a novel intrinsic-time viewpoint, which captures the training progress more faithfully than iteration count. We then establish a Functional Scaling Law (FSL) that captures the full loss trajectory under arbitrary LRSs, with the schedule's influence entering through a simple convolutional functional. We further instantiate the theory for three representative LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- and derive explicit scaling relations in both data- and compute-limited regimes. These comparisons explain key empirical phenomena: (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning-rate decay improves training efficiency; and (iii) WSD-type schedules outperform pure decay. Finally, experiments on LLMs ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters demonstrate the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting and predicting loss trajectories in large-scale pre-training.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation, enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding, and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods across diverse sparsity levels.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. In addition, taking advantage of their inherent modeling foundations, DLLMs have the great potential of efficient inference with parallel decoding algorithms, which enable multi-token prediction per step. However, the high generation quality often requires the number of decoding steps equal to the sequence length, which performs a one-token-per-step decoding, and existing parallel decoding algorithms, which yield suboptimal decoding paths, bring inference speedup at the cost of non-negligible performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free Draft-and-Verification (FreeDave), a novel fast decoding algorithm tailored for DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding without any model modification or extra modules. Specifically, we propose an algorithm of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is theoretically guaranteed to use the fewest model forward calls to reproduce the same sequence generated by static decoding when enough computation and memory budget is provided. By extensive evaluations on math reasoning and code generation benchmarks across different DLLMs, FreeDave is proven to boost the inference throughput up to $3.78\times$ without performance degradation.

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting, outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in continual learning.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM), which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori, spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters, initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers' equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep). Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley. Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable performances.

Abstract: We examine whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios combined with a convex CVaR allocator improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We present MARCD, a generative-to-decision framework with: (i) a Gaussian HMM to infer latent regimes; (ii) a diffusion generator that produces regime-conditioned scenarios; (iii) signal extraction via blended, shrunk moments; and (iv) a governed CVaR epigraph quadratic program. Contributions: Within the Scenario stage we introduce a tail-weighted diffusion objective that up-weights low-quantile outcomes relevant for drawdowns and a regime-expert (MoE) denoiser whose gate increases with crisis posteriors; both are evaluated end-to-end through the allocator. Under strict walk-forward on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD exhibits stronger scenario calibration and materially smaller drawdowns: MaxDD 9.3% versus 14.1% for BL (a 34% reduction) over 2020-2025 out-of-sample. The framework provides an auditable pipeline with explicit budget, box, and turnover constraints, demonstrating the value of decision-aware generative modeling in finance.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data augmentation-based defenses.

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem: the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient, significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and language benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a non-asymptotic, computable PAC-Bayes generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 29.2\% tighter bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop achieves competitive performance on MNIST (99.52\%) and CIFAR-10 (92.03\%), with generalization gaps of 0.48\% and 6.52\%, respectively. We provide fully reproducible code and numerical computation of our bounds to validate our theoretical claims. Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization, making it suitable for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard for aligning models with human feedback, yet its reliance on hard, pairwise preferences makes it brittle to annotator noise and distribution shift. We propose Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a generalized framework that learns from soft, listwise supervision by anchoring policy updates to a reference model. Our key theoretical contribution is to show that this anchoring mechanism imposes an implicit trust region on the policy update, enforced by the softmax Fisher information metric. This provides a robust geometric interpretation for both fixed and dynamic anchor strategies. Our central empirical finding is a task-dependent tradeoff between anchor update strategies. Through controlled experiments across twelve scenarios and two MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that (1) for online exploration in noisy environments, a dynamic anchor that tracks the learning policy is superior, improving performance by 5 to 11 percent over a fixed anchor; and (2) for offline distillation, a fixed anchor pointing to the teacher policy is dramatically more effective, achieving returns of 206.7 on HalfCheetah-v5 (387 percent of teacher) and 65.4 on Hopper-v5 (61 percent of teacher), while reducing KL divergence to the teacher by up to 5000 times compared with standard knowledge distillation. These findings offer clear, practical guidance for selecting anchor strategies and establish ADPO as a robust, unified framework for preference learning. Larger models further amplify ADPO's benefits (0.718 vs. 0.416 at hidden dimension 256), suggesting that anchoring acts as an effective trust-region regularizer. We release code and configurations to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method against latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling, but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures. To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear RNN models at scale.

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks, centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32 attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills, with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT), which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks, including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data scale, is key to defending against novel attacks. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains content that may be harmful or offensive in nature.

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models, minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based approaches.

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further, we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation) from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Optimal Point for Boundary Approximation}$ (OPBA), applies binary search to find decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point. Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of runtime, the OPBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints) counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Finding equilibrium points in continuous minmax games has become a key problem within machine learning, in part due to its connection to the training of generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. Because of existence and robustness issues, recent developments have shifted from pure equilibria to focusing on mixed equilibrium points. In this work we consider a method for finding mixed equilibria in two-layer zero-sum games based on entropic regularisation, where the two competing strategies are represented by two sets of interacting particles. We show that the sequence of empirical measures of the particle system satisfies a large deviation principle as the number of particles grows to infinity, and how this implies convergence of the empirical measure and the associated Nikaid\^o-Isoda error, complementing existing law of large numbers results.

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian tensor regression model to accommodate the effect of multiple factors on phenotype prediction. We adopt a set of prior distributions that resolve identifiability issues that may arise between the parameters in the model. Further, we incorporate a spike-and-slab structure that identifies which interactions are relevant for inclusion in the linear predictor, even when they form a subset of the available variables. Simulation experiments show that our method outperforms previous related models and machine learning algorithms under different sample sizes and degrees of complexity. We further explore the applicability of our model by analysing real-world data related to wheat production across Ireland from 2010 to 2019. Our model performs competitively and overcomes key limitations found in other analogous approaches. Finally, we adapt a set of visualisations for the posterior distribution of the tensor effects that facilitate the identification of optimal interactions between the tensor variables, whilst accounting for the uncertainty in the posterior distribution.

Abstract: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of large language models (LLM) architectures and strategies for "complex" question-answering with a focus on hybrid architectures. LLM based chatbot services have allowed anyone to grasp the potential of LLM to solve many common problems, but soon discovered their limitations for complex questions. Addressing more specific, complex questions (e.g., "What is the best mix of power-generation methods to reduce climate change ?") often requires specialized architectures, domain knowledge, new skills, decomposition and multi-step resolution, deep reasoning, sensitive data protection, explainability, and human-in-the-loop processes. Therefore, we review: (1) necessary skills and tasks for handling complex questions and common LLM limits to overcome; (2) dataset, cost functions and evaluation metrics for measuring and improving (e.g. accuracy, explainability, fairness, robustness, groundedness, faithfulness, toxicity...); (3) family of solutions to overcome LLM limitations by (a) training and reinforcement (b) hybridization, (c) prompting, (d) agentic-architectures (agents, tools) and extended reasoning.

Abstract: It is well known that Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) may attain minimax suboptimal rates in terms of the mean squared error (Birg\'e and Massart, 1993). In this paper, we prove that, under relatively mild assumptions, the suboptimality of ERM must be due to its large bias. Namely, the variance error term of ERM is bounded by the minimax rate. In the fixed design setting, we provide an elementary proof of this result using the probabilistic method. Then, we extend our proof to the random design setting for various models.
  In addition, we provide a simple proof of Chatterjee's admissibility theorem (Chatterjee, 2014, Theorem 1.4), which states that in the fixed design setting, ERM cannot be ruled out as an optimal method, and then we extend this result to the random design setting. We also show that our estimates imply the stability of ERM, complementing the main result of Caponnetto and Rakhlin (2006) for non-Donsker classes. Finally, we highlight the somewhat irregular nature of the loss landscape of ERM in the non-Donsker regime, by showing that functions can be close to ERM, in terms of $L_2$ distance, while still being far from almost-minimizers of the empirical loss.

<title>Knolling Bot: Teaching Robots the Human Notion of Tidiness</title>

Abstract: For robots to truly collaborate and assist humans, they must understand not only logic and instructions, but also the subtle emotions, aesthetics, and feelings that define our humanity. Human art and aesthetics are among the most elusive concepts-often difficult even for people to articulate-and without grasping these fundamentals, robots will be unable to help in many spheres of daily life. Consider the long-promised robotic butler: automating domestic chores demands more than motion planning. It requires an internal model of cleanliness and tidiness-a challenge largely unexplored by AI. To bridge this gap, we propose an approach that equips domestic robots to perform simple tidying tasks via knolling, the practice of arranging scattered items into neat, space-efficient layouts. Unlike the uniformity of industrial settings, household environments feature diverse objects and highly subjective notions of tidiness. Drawing inspiration from NLP, we treat knolling as a sequential prediction problem and employ a transformer based model to forecast each object's placement. Our method learns a generalizable concept of tidiness, generates diverse solutions adaptable to varying object sets, and incorporates human preferences for personalized arrangements. This work represents a step forward in building robots that internalize human aesthetic sense and can genuinely co-create in our living spaces.

<title>LPAC: Learnable Perception-Action-Communication Loops with Applications to Coverage Control</title>

Abstract: Coverage control is the problem of navigating a robot swarm to collaboratively monitor features or a phenomenon of interest not known a priori. The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.

<title>Hybrid-Task Meta-Learning: A GNN Approach for Scalable and Transferable Bandwidth Allocation</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based bandwidth allocation policy that is: 1) scalable with the number of users and 2) transferable to different communication scenarios, such as non-stationary wireless channels, different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, and dynamically available resources. To support scalability, the bandwidth allocation policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN), with which the number of training parameters does not change with the number of users. To enable the generalization of the GNN, we develop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initial parameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios during meta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tune the GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our HML approach can improve the initial performance by 8.79%, and sample efficiency by 73%, compared with existing benchmarks. After fine-tuning, our near-optimal GNN-based policy can achieve close to the same reward with much lower inference complexity compared to the optimal policy obtained using iterative optimization. Numerical results validate that our HML can reduce the computation time by approximately 200 to 2000 times than the optimal iterative algorithm.

Abstract: This study presents OceanCastNet (OCN), a machine learning approach for wave forecasting that incorporates wind and wave fields to predict significant wave height, mean wave period, and mean wave direction.We evaluate OCN's performance against the operational ECWAM model using two independent datasets: NDBC buoy and Jason-3 satellite observations. NDBC station validation indicates OCN performs better at 24 stations compared to ECWAM's 10 stations, and Jason-3 satellite validation confirms similar accuracy across 228-hour forecasts. OCN successfully captures wave patterns during extreme weather conditions, demonstrated through Typhoon Goni with prediction errors typically within $\pm$0.5 m. The approach also offers computational efficiency advantages. The results suggest that machine learning approaches can achieve performance comparable to conventional wave forecasting systems for operational wave prediction applications.

Abstract: Routing Problems are central to many real-world applications, yet remain challenging due to their (NP-)hard nature. Amongst existing approaches, heuristics often offer the best trade-off between quality and scalability, making them suitable for industrial use. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a flexible framework for designing heuristics, its adoption over handcrafted heuristics remains incomplete. Existing learned methods still lack the ability to adapt to specific instances and fully leverage the available computational budget. Current best methods either rely on a collection of pre-trained policies, or on RL fine-tuning; hence failing to fully utilize newly available information within the constraints of the budget. In response, we present MEMENTO, an approach that leverages memory to improve the search of neural solvers at inference. MEMENTO leverages online data collected across repeated attempts to dynamically adjust the action distribution based on the outcome of previous decisions. We validate its effectiveness on the Traveling Salesman and Capacitated Vehicle Routing problems, demonstrating its superiority over tree-search and policy-gradient fine-tuning; and showing that it can be zero-shot combined with diversity-based solvers. We successfully train all RL auto-regressive solvers on large instances, and verify MEMENTO's scalability and data-efficiency: pushing the state-of-the-art on 11 out of 12 evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Let $C_h$ be a composition operator mapping $L^2(\Omega_1)$ into $L^2(\Omega_2)$ for some open sets $\Omega_1, \Omega_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. We characterize the mappings $h$ that transform Riesz bases of $L^2(\Omega_1)$ into Riesz bases of $L^2(\Omega_2)$. Restricting our analysis to differentiable mappings, we demonstrate that mappings $h$ that preserve Riesz bases have Jacobian determinants that are bounded away from zero and infinity. We discuss implications of these results for approximation theory, highlighting the potential of using bijective neural networks to construct Riesz bases with favorable approximation properties.

Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from physics and neuroscience, particularly through the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and language processing. Despite these advances, they struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency -- capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, neuromorphic systems and artificial neural networks often overlook two key biophysical properties of neural circuits: neuronal diversity and cell-specific neuromodulation. These mechanisms, essential for regulating dynamic learning across brain scales, allow neuromodulators to introduce degeneracy in biological neural networks, ensuring stability and adaptability under changing conditions. In this article, we summarize recent bioinspired models, learning rules, and architectures, and propose a framework for augmenting ANNs, which has the potential to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI through neurobiological first principles. Our proposed dual-framework approach leverages spiking neural networks to emulate diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartmental dynamics, thereby simulating the morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how integrating these biophysical principles into task-driven spiking neural networks and neuromorphic systems provides scalable solutions for continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency. Additionally, this approach will not only provide insights into how emergent behaviors arise in neural networks but also catalyze the development of more efficient, reliable, and intelligent neuromorphic systems and robotic agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently seen widespread adoption in both academia and industry. As these models grow, they become valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting substantial investments by their owners. The high cost of cloud-based deployment has spurred interest in running models on edge devices, but this risks exposing parameters to theft and unauthorized use. Existing approaches to protect model IP on the edge trade off practicality, accuracy, or deployment requirements. We introduce SLIP, a hybrid inference algorithm designed to protect edge-deployed models from theft. SLIP is, to our knowledge, the first hybrid protocol that is both practical for real-world applications and provably secure, while incurring zero accuracy degradation and minimal latency overhead. It partitions the model across two computing resources: one secure but expensive, and one cost-effective but vulnerable. Using matrix decomposition, the secure resource retains the most sensitive portion of the model's IP while performing only a small fraction of the computation; the vulnerable resource executes the remainder. The protocol includes security guarantees that prevent attackers from using the partition to infer the protected information. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, positioning it as a compelling solution for protecting LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters exhibit in-context learning abilities, enabling few-shot learning on tasks that the model was not specifically trained for. Traditional models achieve breakthrough performance on language tasks, but do not perform well on basic reasoning benchmarks. However, a new in-context learning approach, Chain-of-thought, has demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning abilities on these benchmarks. The research on LLM reasoning abilities started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade school math word problems, and has expanded to other tasks in the past few years. This article reviews the field of multi-step reasoning with LLMs. We propose a taxonomy that identifies different ways to generate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depth coverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agenda for the near future. We find that multi-step reasoning approaches have progressed beyond math word problems, and can now successfully solve challenges in logic, combinatorial games, and robotics, sometimes by first generating code that is then executed by external tools. Many studies in multi-step methods use reinforcement learning for finetuning, external optimization loops, in-context reinforcement learning, and self-reflection.

Abstract: Unlike fixed- or variable-rate image coding, progressive image coding (PIC) aims to compress various qualities of images into a single bitstream, increasing the versatility of bitstream utilization and providing high compression efficiency compared to simulcast compression. Research on neural network (NN)-based PIC is in its early stages, mainly focusing on applying varying quantization step sizes to the transformed latent representations in a hierarchical manner. These approaches are designed to compress only the progressively added information as the quality improves, considering that a wider quantization interval for lower-quality compression includes multiple narrower sub-intervals for higher-quality compression. However, the existing methods are based on handcrafted quantization hierarchies, resulting in sub-optimal compression efficiency. In this paper, we propose an NN-based progressive coding method that firstly utilizes learned quantization step sizes via learning for each quantization layer. We also incorporate selective compression with which only the essential representation components are compressed for each quantization layer. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher coding efficiency than the existing approaches with decreased decoding time and reduced model size.

Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, demonstrates an improved performance compared to the basic QNG. In this paper we benchmark Momentum-QNG together with the basic QNG, Adam and Momentum optimizers and explore its convergence behaviour. Among the benchmarking problems studied, the best result is obtained for the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the strong spin glass regime. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/borbysh/Momentum-QNG

Abstract: We present a novel three-stage framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a risk-aware multi-agent system for automate strategy finding in quantitative finance. Our approach addresses the brittleness of traditional deep learning models in financial applications by: employing prompt-engineered LLMs to generate executable alpha factor candidates across diverse financial data, implementing multimodal agent-based evaluation that filters factors based on market status, predictive quality while maintaining category balance, and deploying dynamic weight optimization that adapts to market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese & US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction. The overall framework significantly outperforms all benchmarks with 53.17% cumulative return on SSE50 (Jan 2023 to Jan 2024), demonstrating superior risk-adjusted performance and downside protection on the market.

Abstract: Static feature-based Android malware detection using machine learning (ML) remains critical due to its scalability and efficiency. However, existing approaches often overlook security-critical reproducibility concerns, such as dataset duplication, inadequate hyperparameter tuning, and variance from random initialization. This can significantly compromise the practical effectiveness of these systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate these challenges by proposing a more rigorous methodology for model selection and evaluation. Using two widely used datasets, Drebin and APIGraph, we evaluate six ML models of varying complexity under both offline and continuous active learning settings. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to popular belief, well-tuned, simpler models, particularly tree-based methods like XGBoost, consistently outperform more complex neural networks, especially when duplicates are removed. To promote transparency and reproducibility, we open-source our codebase, which is extensible for integrating new models and datasets, facilitating reproducible security research.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. To understand why they perform so well and to assess their reliability, several studies have focused on questions such as: Which linguistic properties are encoded by these models, and to what extent? How robust are these models in encoding linguistic properties when faced with perturbations in the input text? However, these studies have mainly focused on BERT and the English language. In this paper, we investigate similar questions regarding encoding capability and robustness for 8 linguistic properties across 13 different perturbations in 6 Indic languages, using 9 multilingual Transformer models (7 universal and 2 Indic-specific). To conduct this study, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark dataset, IndicSentEval, containing approximately $\sim$47K sentences. Surprisingly, our probing analysis of surface, syntactic, and semantic properties reveals that while almost all multilingual models demonstrate consistent encoding performance for English, they show mixed results for Indic languages. As expected, Indic-specific multilingual models capture linguistic properties in Indic languages better than universal models. Intriguingly, universal models broadly exhibit better robustness compared to Indic-specific models, particularly under perturbations such as dropping both nouns and verbs, dropping only verbs, or keeping only nouns. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into probing and perturbation-specific strengths and weaknesses of popular multilingual Transformer-based models for different Indic languages. We make our code and dataset publicly available [https://github.com/aforakhilesh/IndicBertology].

Abstract: Applying large pre-trained Vision-Language Models to recommendation is a burgeoning field, a direction we term Vision-Language-Recommendation (VLR). Bringing VLR to user-oriented on-device intelligence within a federated learning framework is a crucial step for enhancing user privacy and delivering personalized experiences. This paper introduces FedVLR, a federated VLR framework specially designed for user-specific personalized fusion of vision-language representations. At its core is a novel bi-level fusion mechanism: The server-side multi-view fusion module first generates a diverse set of pre-fused multimodal views. Subsequently, each client employs a user-specific mixture-of-expert mechanism to adaptively integrate these views based on individual user interaction history. This designed lightweight personalized fusion module provides an efficient solution to implement a federated VLR system. The effectiveness of our proposed FedVLR has been validated on seven benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or outdated information, especially in low-resource settings or when dealing with private data. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) uses external knowledge bases (KBs), but these can also suffer from inaccuracies. We introduce STACKFEED, a novel Structured Textual Actor-Critic Knowledge base editing with FEEDback approach that iteratively refines the KB based on expert feedback using a multi-actor, centralized critic reinforcement learning framework. STACKFEED defines a ReACT actor agent on each document to perform structured edits based on document specific targeted instructions. Experimental results showcase that STACKFEED significantly improves KB quality and performance of the RAG system. We evaluate STACKFEED on low-resource programming problems, modified python packaged and factual question-answering tasks.

Abstract: Given an intractable target density $p$, variational inference (VI) attempts to find the best approximation $q$ from a tractable family $Q$. This is typically done by minimizing the exclusive Kullback-Leibler divergence, $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In practice, $Q$ is not rich enough to contain $p$, and the approximation is misspecified even when it is a unique global minimizer of $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of VI to these misspecifications when $p$ exhibits certain symmetries and $Q$ is a location-scale family that shares these symmetries. We prove strong guarantees for VI not only under mild regularity conditions but also in the face of severe misspecifications. Namely, we show that (i) VI recovers the mean of $p$ when $p$ exhibits an \textit{even} symmetry, and (ii) it recovers the correlation matrix of $p$ when in addition~$p$ exhibits an \textit{elliptical} symmetry. These guarantees hold for the mean even when $q$ is factorized and $p$ is not, and for the correlation matrix even when~$q$ and~$p$ behave differently in their tails. We analyze various regimes of Bayesian inference where these symmetries are useful idealizations, and we also investigate experimentally how VI behaves in their absence.

Abstract: We consider learning nonholonomic dynamical systems while discovering the constraints, and describe in detail the case of the rolling disk. A nonholonomic system is a system subject to nonholonomic constraints. Unlike holonomic constraints, nonholonomic constraints do not define a sub-manifold on the configuration space. Therefore, the inverse problem of finding the constraints has to involve the tangent bundle. This paper discusses a general procedure to learn the dynamics of a nonholonomic system through Hamel's formalism, while discovering the system constraint by parameterizing it, given the data set of discrete trajectories on the tangent bundle $TQ$. We prove that there is a local minimum for convergence of the network. We also preserve symmetry of the system by reducing the Lagrangian to the Lie algebra of the selected group.

Abstract: Accurate prediction and synthesis of seismic waveforms are crucial for seismic-hazard assessment and earthquake-resistant infrastructure design. Existing prediction methods, such as ground-motion models and physics-based wave-field simulations, often fail to capture the full complexity of seismic wavefields, particularly at higher frequencies. This study introduces HighFEM, a novel, computationally efficient, and scalable (i.e., capable of generating many seismograms simultaneously) generative model for high-frequency seismic-waveform generation. Our approach leverages a spectrogram representation of the seismic-waveform data, which is reduced to a lower-dimensional manifold via an autoencoder. A state-of-the-art diffusion model is trained to generate this latent representation conditioned on key input parameters: earthquake magnitude, recording distance, site conditions, hypocenter depth, and azimuthal gap. The model generates waveforms with frequency content up to 50 Hz. Any scalar ground-motion statistic, such as peak ground-motion amplitudes and spectral accelerations, can be readily derived from the synthesized waveforms. We validate our model using commonly employed seismological metrics and performance metrics from image-generation studies. Our results demonstrate that the openly available model can generate realistic high-frequency seismic waveforms across a wide range of input parameters, even in data-sparse regions. For the scalar ground-motion statistics commonly used in seismic-hazard and earthquake-engineering studies, we show that our model accurately reproduces both the median trends of the real data and their variability. To evaluate and compare the growing number of these and similar Generative Waveform Models (GWMs), we argue that they should be openly available and included in community ground-motion-model evaluation efforts.

In recent years, it has received increasing attention, particularly through post-hoc detection and training-based methods. In this paper, we focus on post-hoc OOD detection, which enables identifying OOD samples without altering the model's training procedure or objective. Our primary goal is to investigate the relationship between model capacity and its OOD detection performance. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: Does the Double Descent phenomenon manifest in post-hoc OOD detection? This question is crucial, as it can reveal whether overparameterization, which is already known to benefit generalization, can also enhance OOD detection. Despite the growing interest in these topics by the classic supervised machine learning community, this intersection remains unexplored for OOD detection. We empirically demonstrate that the Double Descent effect does indeed appear in post-hoc OOD detection. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights to explain why this phenomenon emerges in such setting. Finally, we show that the overparameterized regime does not yield superior results consistently, and we propose a method to identify the optimal regime for OOD detection based on our observations.

Abstract: This study investigates the development of an optimal execution strategy through reinforcement learning, aiming to determine the most effective approach for traders to buy and sell inventory within a finite time horizon. Our proposed model leverages input features derived from the current state of the limit order book and operates at a high frequency to maximize control. To simulate this environment and overcome the limitations associated with relying on historical data, we utilize the multi-agent market simulator ABIDES, which provides a diverse range of depth levels within the limit order book. We present a custom MDP formulation followed by the results of our methodology and benchmark the performance against standard execution strategies. Results show that the reinforcement learning agent outperforms standard strategies and offers a practical foundation for real-world trading applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have recently advanced the image reconstruction quality of super-resolution (SR) models. Yet, their scalability remains limited by quadratic attention costs and coarse patch embeddings that weaken pixel-level fidelity. We propose TaylorIR, a plug-and-play framework that enforces 1x1 patch embeddings for true pixel-wise reasoning and replaces conventional self-attention with TaylorShift, a Taylor-series-based attention mechanism enabling full token interactions with near-linear complexity. Across multiple SR benchmarks, TaylorIR delivers state-of-the-art performance while reducing memory consumption by up to 60%, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained detail restoration and efficient transformer scaling.

<title>TESGNN: Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Networks for Efficient and Robust Multi-View 3D Scene Understanding</title>

Abstract: Scene graphs have proven to be highly effective for various scene understanding tasks due to their compact and explicit representation of relational information. However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN shown to be effective compared to existing methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Finally, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges. Our source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/HySonLab/TESGraph

<title>FLRONet: Deep Operator Learning for High-Fidelity Fluid Flow Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements is vital for many science and engineering applications but remains challenging because of dimensional disparities between state and observational spaces. Due to such dimensional differences, the measurement operator becomes ill-conditioned and non-invertible, making the reconstruction of flow fields from sensor measurements extremely difficult. Although sparse optimization and machine learning address the above problems to some extent, questions about their generalization and efficiency remain, particularly regarding the discretization dependence of these models. In this context, deep operator learning offers a better solution as this approach models mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, enabling superior generalization and discretization-independent reconstruction. We introduce FLRONet, a deep operator learning framework that is trained to reconstruct fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements. FLRONet employs a branch-trunk network architecture to represent the inverse measurement operator that maps sensor observations to the original flow field, a continuous function of both space and time. Validation performed on the CFDBench dataset has demonstrated that FLRONet consistently achieves high levels of reconstruction accuracy and robustness, even in scenarios where sensor measurements are inaccurate or missing. Furthermore, the operator learning approach endows FLRONet with the capability to perform zero-shot super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains, offering a solution for rapid reconstruction of high-fidelity flow fields.

Abstract: Online linear programming (OLP) has found broad applications in revenue management and resource allocation. State-of-the-art OLP algorithms achieve low regret by repeatedly solving linear programming (LP) subproblems that incorporate updated resource information. However, LP-based methods are computationally expensive and often inefficient for large-scale applications. In contrast, recent first-order OLP algorithms are more computationally efficient but typically suffer from worse regret guarantees. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new algorithm that combines the strengths of LP-based and first-order OLP methods. The algorithm re-solves the LP subproblems periodically at a predefined frequency $f$ and uses the latest dual prices to guide online decision-making. In addition, a first-order method runs in parallel during each interval between LP re-solves, smoothing resource consumption. Our algorithm achieves $\mathscr{O}(\log (T/f) + \sqrt{f})$ regret, delivering a "wait-less" online decision-making process that balances the computational efficiency of first-order methods and the superior regret guarantee of LP-based methods.

<title>Nirvana AI Governance: How AI Policymaking Is Committing Three Old Fallacies</title>

Abstract: This research applies Harold Demsetz's concept of the nirvana approach to the realm of AI governance and debunks three common fallacies in various AI policy proposals--"the grass is always greener on the other side," "free lunch," and "the people could be different." Through this, I expose fundamental flaws in the current AI regulatory proposal. First, some commentators intuitively believe that people are more reliable than machines and that government works better in risk control than companies' self-regulation, but they do not fully compare the differences between the status quo and the proposed replacements. Second, when proposing some regulatory tools, some policymakers and researchers do not realize and even gloss over the fact that harms and costs are also inherent in their proposals. Third, some policy proposals are initiated based on a false comparison between the AI-driven world, where AI does lead to some risks, and an entirely idealized world, where no risk exists at all. However, the appropriate approach is to compare the world where AI causes risks to the real world where risks are everywhere, but people can live well with these risks. The prevalence of these fallacies in AI governance underscores a broader issue: the tendency to idealize potential solutions without fully considering their real-world implications. This idealization can lead to regulatory proposals that are not only impractical but potentially harmful to innovation and societal progress.

arXiv:2501.15417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AnyEnhance, a unified generative model for voice enhancement that processes both speech and singing voices. Based on a masked generative model, AnyEnhance is capable of handling both speech and singing voices, supporting a wide range of enhancement tasks including denoising, dereverberation, declipping, super-resolution, and target speaker extraction, all simultaneously and without fine-tuning. AnyEnhance introduces a prompt-guidance mechanism for in-context learning, which allows the model to natively accept a reference speaker's timbre. In this way, it could boost enhancement performance when a reference audio is available and enable the target speaker extraction task without altering the underlying architecture. Moreover, we also introduce a self-critic mechanism into the generative process for masked generative models, yielding higher-quality outputs through iterative self-assessment and refinement. Extensive experiments on various enhancement tasks demonstrate AnyEnhance outperforms existing methods in terms of both objective metrics and subjective listening tests. Demo audios are publicly available at https://amphionspace.github.io/anyenhance. An open-source implementation is provided at https://github.com/viewfinder-annn/anyenhance-v1-ccf-aatc.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to compress large datasets into compact yet highly informative subsets that preserve the training behavior of the original data. While this concept has gained traction in classification, its potential for image Super-Resolution (SR) remains largely untapped. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of dataset distillation for SR, evaluating both pixel- and latent-space formulations. We show that a distilled dataset, occupying only 8.88% of the original size, can train SR models that retain nearly the same reconstruction fidelity as those trained on full datasets. Furthermore, we analyze how initialization strategies and distillation objectives affect efficiency, convergence, and visual quality. Our findings highlight the feasibility of SR dataset distillation and establish foundational insights for memory- and compute-efficient generative restoration models.

Abstract: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.

<title>THFlow: A Temporally Hierarchical Flow Matching Framework for 3D Peptide Design</title>

Abstract: Deep generative models provide a promising approach to de novo 3D peptide design. Most of them jointly model the distributions of peptide's position, orientation, and conformation, attempting to simultaneously converge to the target pocket. However, in the early stage of docking, optimizing conformation-only modalities such as rotation and torsion can be physically meaningless, as the peptide is initialized far from the protein pocket and no interaction field is present. We define this problem as the multimodal temporal inconsistency problem and claim it is a key factor contributing to low binding affinity in generated peptides. To address this challenge, we propose THFlow, a novel flow matching-based multimodal generative model that explicitly models the temporal hierarchy between peptide position and conformation. It employs a polynomial based conditional flow to accelerate positional convergence early on, and later aligns it with rotation and torsion for coordinated conformation refinement under the emerging interaction field. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related features, such as polarity, to further enhance the model's understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering an effective and accurate solution for advancing peptide-based therapeutic development.

Abstract: Numerous countries globally face shortages of medical experts, deepening inequalities in access to healthcare. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tools hold considerable promise to tackle this challenge by enabling even novices to deliver expert-level medical services. However, reliance on AI for task completion may hinder the learning required for novices to develop expertise. We thus explore whether AI-based diagnostic tools can be used to enhance not only performance but also learning in the context of lung cancer diagnosis. We examine the distinct effects of AI input during training (i.e., learning how to diagnose) versus in practice (i.e., completing diagnostic tasks) on novice medical professionals' performance. In two field experiments, 576 medical students were randomly assigned across conditions, manipulating the access to AI input during their training, during a test of their diagnostic capabilities, or both. During practice, participants diagnosed potential lung cancer cases using chest CT scans, and their diagnoses were evaluated against the ground truth obtained through histopathological examinations. Study 1 (N = 336) revealed that AI input in training alone improved human diagnostic accuracy by 3.2 percentage points over the control, while AI input during practice alone increased human accuracy by 7.9 percentage points. Combined deployment in both training and practice yielded an improvement of 13.7 percentage points--significantly exceeding either approach alone. Study 2 (N = 240) showed that AI input in practice alone improved accuracy in subsequent practice, unaided by AI, by 9.9 percentage points over the control. Even minimally informative AI input in training improved diagnostic accuracy by 5.3 percentage points over the control. These results reveal AI's dual role: As a tool, it could rapidly improve novices' performance.

Abstract: This paper aims to provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In a first part, we establish DP guarantees on samples output by MCMC algorithms as well as Monte Carlo estimators associated with these methods under assumptions on the convergence properties of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, our results highlight the critical condition of ensuring the target distribution is differentially private itself. In a second part, we specialise our analysis to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and establish guarantees on their (R\'enyi) DP. To this end, we develop a novel methodology based on Girsanov's theorem combined with a perturbation trick to obtain bounds for an unbounded domain and in a non-convex setting. We establish: (i) uniform in $n$ privacy guarantees when the state of the chain after $n$ iterations is released, (ii) bounds on the privacy of the entire chain trajectory. These findings provide concrete guidelines for privacy-preserving MCMC.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is fundamental to intelligent vehicles. Wheel load, one of the most important chassis states, serves as an essential input for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and exerts a direct influence on vehicle stability and safety. However, wheel load estimation remains challenging due to the complexity of chassis modeling and the susceptibility of nonlinear systems to noise. To address these issues, this paper first introduces a refined suspension linkage-level modeling approach that constructs a nonlinear instantaneous dynamic model by explicitly considering the complex geometric structure of the suspension. Building upon this, we propose a damper characteristics-based Bayesian physics-informed neural network (Damper-B-PINN) framework to estimate dynamic wheel load, which leverages the suspension dynamics as physical guidance of PINN while employing Bayesian inference to mitigate the effects of system noise and uncertainty. Moreover, a damper-characteristic physics conditioning (DPC) module is designed for embedding physical prior. The proposed Damper-B-PINN is evaluated using both high-fidelity simulation datasets generated by CarSim software and real-world datasets collected from a Formula Student race car. Experimental results demonstrate that our Damper-B-PINN consistently outperforms existing methods across various test conditions, particularly extreme ones. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed Damper-B-PINN framework to enhance the accuracy and robustness of dynamic wheel load estimation, thereby improving the reliability and safety of ADAS applications.

Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for rover localization on Mars. Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile robots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied environments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is computationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel encoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the sandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific surveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and localization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and the upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the search of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in Mars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep learning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose prediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework to output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog environment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both outperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in high-slip environments. Lastly, we present the first dataset aimed at GPR-based localization in Mars analog environments, which will be made publicly available at https://umfieldrobotics.github.io/marslgpr.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors. However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.

Abstract: The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer 60 percent performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.

Abstract: Multilingual speech translation (ST) and machine translation (MT) in the medical domain enhances patient care by enabling efficient communication across language barriers, alleviating specialized workforce shortages, and facilitating improved diagnosis and treatment, particularly during pandemics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract "vectors of variable variations" (e.g., "male" to "female") from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.

<title>Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. This study compares the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error that is 7% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.37% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.

Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new MG called Flex-MG, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.

<title>Behavior of prediction performance metrics with rare events</title>

Abstract: Objective: Area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC) is commonly reported alongside prediction models for binary outcomes. Recent articles have raised concerns that AUC might be a misleading measure of prediction performance in the rare event setting. This setting is common since many events of clinical importance are rare. We aimed to determine whether the bias and variance of AUC are driven by the number of events or the event rate. We also investigated the behavior of other commonly used measures of prediction performance, including positive predictive value, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
  Study Design and Setting: We conducted a simulation study to determine when or whether AUC is unstable in the rare event setting by varying the size of datasets used to train and evaluate prediction models. This plasmode simulation study was based on data from the Mental Health Research Network; the data contained 149 predictors and the outcome of interest, suicide attempt, which had event rate 0.92\% in the original dataset.
  Results: Our results indicate that poor AUC behavior -- as measured by empirical bias, variability of cross-validated AUC estimates, and empirical coverage of confidence intervals -- is driven by the number of events in a rare-event setting, not event rate. Performance of sensitivity is driven by the number of events, while that of specificity is driven by the number of non-events. Other measures, including positive predictive value and accuracy, depend on the event rate even in large samples.
  Conclusion: AUC is reliable in the rare event setting provided that the total number of events is moderately large; in our simulations, we observed near zero bias with 1000 events.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation learning in remote sensing. Many such foundation models adopt approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches for how to most effectively leverage remotely sensed data. This paper examines these approaches, along with their roots in the computer vision field. This is done to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls, while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We first examine single-sensor remote foundation models to introduce concepts and provide context, and then place emphasis on incorporating the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations into foundation models. In particular, we explore the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.

Abstract: The growing luminosity frontier at the Large Hadron Collider is challenging the reconstruction and analysis of particle collision events. Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the empirical sciences involves uncovering causal structure through observation and experimentation. Causal discovery entails linking the conditional independence (CI) invariances in observational data to their corresponding graphical constraints via d-separation. In this paper, we consider a general setting where we have access to data from multiple experimental distributions resulting from hard interventions, as well as potentially from an observational distribution. By comparing different interventional distributions, we propose a set of graphical constraints that are fundamentally linked to Pearl's do-calculus within the framework of hard interventions. These graphical constraints associate each graphical structure with a set of interventional distributions that are consistent with the rules of do-calculus. We characterize the interventional equivalence class of causal graphs with latent variables and introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine whether two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent, i.e., whether they are associated with the same family of hard interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances from do-calculus. We also propose a learning algorithm to integrate multiple datasets from hard interventions, introducing new orientation rules. The learning objective is a tuple of augmented graphs which entails a set of causal graphs. We also prove the soundness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: A generalist robot should perform effectively across various environments. However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate scalable and efficient robot policy learning.

Abstract: With the emergence of large model-based agents, widely adopted transformer-based architectures inevitably produce excessively long token embeddings for transmission, which may result in high bandwidth overhead, increased power consumption and latency. In this letter, we propose a task-oriented multimodal token transmission scheme for efficient multimodal information fusion and utilization. To improve the efficiency of token transmission, we design a two-stage training algotithm, including cross-modal alignment and task-oriented fine-tuning, for large model-based token communication. Meanwhile, token compression is performed using a sliding window pooling operation to save communication resources. To balance the trade-off between latency and model performance caused by compression, we formulate a weighted-sum optimization problem over latency and validation loss. We jointly optimizes bandwidth, power allocation, and token length across users by using an alternating optimization method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline under different bandwidth and power budgets. Moreover, the two-stage training algorithm achieves higher accuracy across various signal-to-noise ratios than the method without cross-modal alignment.

<title>New Encoders for German Trained from Scratch: Comparing ModernGBERT with Converted LLM2Vec Models</title>

Abstract: Encoders remain essential for efficient German NLP and NLU scenarios despite the rise of decoder-only LLMs. This work studies two routes to high-quality German encoders under identical data and training constraints: 1) training from scratch and 2) converting decoders via LLM2Vec. We introduce two resources: ModernGBERT (134M, 1B), fully transparent German encoders in the ModernBERT style, and LL\"aMmleinVec (120M, 1B, 7B), decoder-to-encoder conversions trained with masked next-token prediction, both undergoing a context extension to 8.192 tokens.
  Across SuperGLEBer, ModernGBERT 1B sets a new state of the art (avg 0.808), surpassing GBERT Large (+4%) and the seven-times larger converted 7B model (0.787). On German MTEB after supervised fine-tuning, ModernGBERT 1B (0.551) approaches the converted 7B model (0.557).
  We release all models, checkpoints, datasets, and full training records, and introduce an encoder-adapted QA-NIAH evaluation. All in all, our results provide actionable guidance: when parameter efficiency and latency matter, from-scratch encoders dominate. When a pre-trained decoder exists and compute is a limited, conversion offers an effective alternative. ModernGBERT and LL\"aMmleinVec, including all code, data and intermediary checkpoints are published under a research-only RAIL license.

Abstract: Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages, such as specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three distinct hardware platforms, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x faster than the vendor-provided library (Gemmini), outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.9x (AWS Trainium), and achieves 3.8x higher performance than a machine learning-based cost model for GPUs (NVIDIA L40S). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.

<title>Exploring the limits of strong membership inference attacks on large language models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.18773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art membership inference attacks (MIAs) typically require training many reference models, making it difficult to scale these attacks to large pre-trained language models (LLMs). As a result, prior research has either relied on weaker attacks that avoid training references (e.g., fine-tuning attacks), or on stronger attacks applied to small models and datasets. However, weaker attacks have been shown to be brittle and insights from strong attacks in simplified settings do not translate to today's LLMs. These challenges prompt an important question: are the limitations observed in prior work due to attack design choices, or are MIAs fundamentally ineffective on LLMs? We address this question by scaling LiRA--one of the strongest MIAs--to GPT-2 architectures ranging from 10M to 1B parameters, training references on over 20B tokens from the C4 dataset. Our results advance the understanding of MIAs on LLMs in four key ways. While (1) strong MIAs can succeed on pre-trained LLMs, (2) their effectiveness, remains limited (e.g., AUC<0.7) in practical settings. (3) Even when strong MIAs achieve better-than-random AUC, aggregate metrics can conceal substantial per-sample MIA decision instability: due to training randomness, many decisions are so unstable that they are statistically indistinguishable from a coin flip. Finally, (4) the relationship between MIA success and related LLM privacy metrics is not as straightforward as prior work has suggested.

arXiv:2505.19046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of generative models has created a feedback loop, in which each generation of models is trained on data partially produced by its predecessors. This process has raised concerns about model collapse: A critical degradation in performance caused by repeated training on synthetic data. However, different analyses in the literature have reached different conclusions as to the severity of model collapse. As such, it remains unclear how concerning this phenomenon is, and under which assumptions it can be avoided. To address this, we theoretically study model collapse for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), in a natural setting where synthetic data is gradually added to the original data set. Under standard assumptions (similar to those long used for proving asymptotic consistency and normality of MLE), we establish non-asymptotic bounds showing that collapse can be avoided even as the fraction of real data vanishes. On the other hand, we prove that some assumptions (beyond MLE consistency) are indeed necessary: Without them, model collapse can occur arbitrarily quickly, even when the original data is still present in the training set. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous examples of iterative generative modeling with accumulating data that rapidly leads to model collapse.

arXiv:2505.21189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive generation from just one trained input embedding. In this work, we explore whether autoregressive decoding is essential for such reconstruction. We show that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one token-parallel forward pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising and underexplored multi-token generation capability of autoregressive LLMs. We examine these embeddings and characterize the information they encode. We also empirically show that, although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form connected and local regions in embedding space - suggesting the potential to train a practical encoder. The existence of such representations hints that multi-token generation may be natively accessible in off-the-shelf LLMs via a learned input encoder, eliminating heavy retraining and helping to overcome the fundamental bottleneck of autoregressive decoding while reusing already-trained models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/Knowledge2Data.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale, pre-trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems that have revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision, and are now advancing geospatial analysis and Earth Observation (EO). They promise improved generalization across tasks, scalability, and efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data. However, despite the rapid proliferation of geospatial FMs, their real-world utility and alignment with global sustainability goals remain underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a comprehensive benchmarking framework grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with extremely diverse tasks ranging from asset wealth prediction to environmental hazard detection. This study provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and offers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our findings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform traditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs should go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and energy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable scalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex sustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from model-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics such as energy efficiency, robustness to domain shifts, and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Measuring alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge, especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex. Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text, we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset, CycleReward, outperforms state-of-the-art alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling, while maintaining speed and differentiability. Furthermore, performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation. Our dataset, model, and code are publicly released at https://cyclereward.github.io.

Abstract: We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data. Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize -- for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with finite minimizers.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for 6G wireless systems by transmitting task-relevant information rather than raw bits, yet existing approaches remain vulnerable to dual sources of uncertainty: semantic misinterpretation arising from imperfect feature extraction and transmission-level perturbations from channel noise. Current deep learning based SemCom systems typically employ domain-specific architectures that lack robustness guarantees and fail to generalize across diverse noise conditions, adversarial attacks, and out-of-distribution data. In this paper, a novel and generalized semantic communication framework called WaSeCom is proposed to systematically address uncertainty and enhance robustness. In particular, Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization is employed to provide resilience against semantic misinterpretation and channel perturbations. A rigorous theoretical analysis is performed to establish the robust generalization guarantees of the proposed framework. Experimental results on image and text transmission demonstrate that WaSeCom achieves improved robustness under noise and adversarial perturbations. These results highlight its effectiveness in preserving semantic fidelity across varying wireless conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The growing use of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made model inference on mobile clients both feasible and popular. Yet these devices remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, threatening model robustness and security. Federated adversarial training (FAT) offers a promising solution by enhancing robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT often yields a generalized global model that struggles with heterogeneous client data, leading to limited personalization and significant communication overhead. In this paper, we propose \textit{Lorica}, a personalized synergistic adversarial training framework that delivers customized defense models through a two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Lorica} applies LoRA-FA for local adversarial fine-tuning, enabling personalized robustness while reducing communication by uploading only LoRA-FA parameters. In Phase 2, a forward-gating selection strategy improves benign accuracy, further refining the personalized model. This yields tailored defense models that effectively balance robustness and accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Lorica} can achieve up to 68$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.9\% and 52.2\% enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their representations. We find that small and large models learn similar representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. In particular, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to 50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability, finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

arXiv:2506.07801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a pseudo-label weighting module designed for selecting and filtering pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, i.e., MultiMatch achieves state-of-the-art results on 8 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language processing datasets and ranks first according to the Friedman test among 21 methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26%, a critical advantage for real-world text classification tasks. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction. Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at https://ineqmath.github.io/.

<title>Where and How to Perturb: On the Design of Perturbation Guidance in Diffusion and Flow Models</title>

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

<title>SplashNet: Split-and-Share Encoders for Accurate and Efficient Typing with Surface Electromyography</title>

arXiv:2506.12356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) at the wrists could enable natural, keyboard-free text entry, yet the state-of-the-art emg2qwerty baseline still misrecognizes $51.8\%$ of characters in the zero-shot setting on unseen users and $7.0\%$ after user-specific fine-tuning. We trace many of these errors to mismatched cross-user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high-order feature dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization, which adaptively aligns input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which encourages reliance on low-order feature combinations more likely to generalize across users; and (iii) a Split-and-Share encoder that processes each hand independently with weight-shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of the neuromuscular system. Combined with a five-fold reduction in spectral resolution ($33\!\rightarrow\!6$ frequency bands), these components yield a compact Split-and-Share model, SplashNet-mini, which uses only $\tfrac14$ the parameters and $0.6\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline while reducing character-error rate (CER) to $36.4\%$ zero-shot and $5.9\%$ after fine-tuning. An upscaled variant, SplashNet ($\tfrac12$ the parameters, $1.15\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline), further lowers error to $35.7\%$ and $5.5\%$, representing relative improvements of $31\%$ and $21\%$ in the zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, respectively. SplashNet therefore establishes a new state of the art without requiring additional data.

arXiv:2506.17197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in flow-based generative modelling have provided scalable methods for computing the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) between distributions, a dynamic form of entropy-regularised Optimal Transport (OT) for the quadratic cost. The successful Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure solves the SB problem via sequential bridge-matching steps, presenting an elegant and practical approach with many favourable properties over the more traditional Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Beyond the standard setting, optimal transport can be generalised to the multi-marginal case in which the objective is to minimise a cost defined over several marginal distributions. Of particular importance are costs defined over a tree structure, from which Wasserstein barycentres can be recovered as a special case. In this work, we extend the IMF procedure to solve for the tree-structured SB problem. Our resulting algorithm inherits the many advantages of IMF over IPF approaches in the tree-based setting. In the case of Wasserstein barycentres, our approach can be viewed as extending the widely used fixed-point approach to use flow-based entropic OT solvers, while requiring only simple bridge-matching steps at each iteration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.

arXiv:2507.04221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for LLMs, they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples, leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard, and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with significantly higher training efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought (CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs. We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal easier to optimize.

arXiv:2507.10057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have focused exclusively on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full documents and calculating similarity between them. Yet, abstracts offer only sparse and high-level summaries, and such methods primarily optimize one-to-one similarity, overlooking the dynamic relations that emerge among relevant papers during the retrieval process. To address this, we propose Chain of Retrieval(COR), a novel iterative framework for full-paper retrieval. Specifically, CoR decomposes each query paper into multiple aspect-specific views, matches them against segmented candidate papers, and iteratively expands the search by promoting top-ranked results as new queries, thereby forming a tree-structured retrieval process. The resulting retrieval tree is then aggregated in a post-order manner: descendants are first combined at the query level, then recursively merged with their parent nodes, to capture hierarchical relations across iterations. To validate this, we present SCIFULLBENCH, a large-scale benchmark providing both complete and segmented contexts of full papers for queries and candidates, and results show that CoR significantly outperforms existing retrieval baselines. Our code and dataset is available at https://github.com/psw0021/Chain-of-Retrieval.git.

Abstract: We propose a doubly robust estimator for the average treatment effect in high dimensional
  low sample size observational studies, where contamination and model misspecification pose
  serious inferential challenges. The estimator combines bounded influence estimating equations
  for outcome modeling with covariate balancing propensity scores for treatment assignment,
  embedded within a penalized empirical likelihood framework using nonconvex regularization.
  It satisfies the oracle property by jointly achieving consistency under partial model correct ness, selection consistency, robustness to contamination, and asymptotic normality. For uncertainty quantification, we derive a finite sample confidence interval using cumulant generating
  functions and influence function corrections, avoiding reliance on asymptotic approximations.
  Simulation studies and applications to gene expression datasets (Golub and Khan) demonstrate superior performance in bias, error metrics, and interval calibration, highlighting the
  method robustness and inferential validity in HDLSS regimes. One notable aspect is that
  even in the absence of contamination, the proposed estimator and its confidence interval
  remain efficient compared to those of competing models.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for comprehensive security evaluation.

Abstract: Integer and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (INLP, MINLP) are central to logistics, energy, and scheduling, but remain computationally challenging. This survey examines how machine learning and reinforcement learning can enhance exact optimization methods-particularly branch-and-bound (BB)-without compromising global optimality. We cover discrete, continuous, and mixed-integer formulations, and highlight applications such as vehicle routing, hydropower planning, and crew scheduling. We introduce a unified BB framework that embeds learning-based strategies into branching, cut selection, node ordering, and parameter control. Classical algorithms are augmented using supervised, imitation, and reinforcement learning models to accelerate convergence while maintaining correctness. We conclude with a taxonomy of learning methods by solver class and learning paradigm, and outline open challenges in generalization, hybridization, and scaling intelligent solvers.

<title>Optimizing Token Choice for Code Watermarking: An RL Approach</title>

Abstract: Protecting intellectual property on LLM-generated code necessitates effective watermarking systems that can operate within code's highly structured, syntactically constrained nature. In this work, we introduce CodeTracer, an innovative adaptive code watermarking framework underpinned by a novel reinforcement learning training paradigm. At its core, CodeTracer features a policy-driven approach that utilizes a parameterized model to intelligently bias token choices during next-token prediction. This strategy ensures that embedded watermarks maintain code functionality while exhibiting subtle yet statistically detectable deviations from typical token distributions. To facilitate policy learning, we devise a comprehensive reward system that seamlessly integrates execution feedback with watermark embedding signals, balancing process-level and outcome-level rewards. Additionally, we employ Gumbel Top-k reparameterization to enable gradient-based optimization of discrete watermarking decisions. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate CodeTracer's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both watermark detectability and the preservation of generated code's functionality.

Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics, we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain, we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up to 72%.

<title>Zero-knowledge LLM hallucination detection and mitigation through fine-grained cross-model consistency</title>

arXiv:2508.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages fine-grained cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves up to 9 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

The algorithm can be used to find exact hyperparameters that optimize leave-one-out cross-validation either globally or locally, and its practicality is demonstrated on real-world data sets. I also show how the algorithm can be modified to compute approximate leave-one-out cross-validation, making it suitable for larger data sets.

arXiv:2508.19073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GPUs running deep learning (DL) workloads are frequently underutilized. Collocating multiple DL training tasks on the same GPU can improve utilization but introduces two key risks: (1) out-of-memory (OOM) crashes for newly scheduled tasks, and (2) severe performance interference among co-running tasks, which can negate any throughput gains. These issues reduce system robustness, quality of service, and energy efficiency. We present CARMA, a task-level, collocation-aware resource management system for the server-scale. CARMA addresses collocation challenges via (1) fine-grained monitoring and bookkeeping of GPUs and a collocation risk analysis that filters out the high-risk GPUs; (2) task placement policies that cap GPU utilization to avoid OOMs and limit interference; (3) integration of GPU memory need estimators for DL tasks to minimize OOMs during collocation; and (4) a lightweight recovery method that relaunches jobs crashed due to OOMs. Our evaluation on a DL training workload derived from real-world traces shows that CARMA uses GPUs more efficiently by making more informed collocation decisions: for the best-performing collocation policy, CARMA increases GPU streaming multiprocessor (SM) utilization by 54%, the parallelism achieved per SM by 61%, and memory use by 62%. This results in a $\sim$35% and $\sim$15% reduction in the end-to-end execution time (makespan) and GPU energy consumption, respectively, for this workload.

<title>Understanding and Improving Shampoo and SOAP via Kullback-Leibler Minimization</title>

Abstract: Shampoo and its efficient variant, SOAP, employ structured second-moment estimations and have shown strong performance for training neural networks (NNs). In practice, however, Shampoo typically requires step-size grafting with Adam to be competitive, and SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis -- at the cost of additional memory overhead from Adam in both methods. Prior analyses have largely relied on the Frobenius norm to motivate these estimation schemes. We instead recast their estimation procedures as covariance estimation under Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization, revealing a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivating principled redesigns. Building on this perspective, we develop $\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\textbf{KL-SOAP}$, practical schemes that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP in NN pre-training while achieving SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to attain competitive performance, eliminating the memory overhead introduced by Adam. Across our experiments, KL-Shampoo consistently outperforms SOAP, Shampoo, and even KL-SOAP, establishing the KL-based approach as a compelling foundation for designing structured methods in NN optimization.

Abstract: On-the-fly reasoning often requires adaptation to novel problems under limited data and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning. Within- and between-model performance varied heavily across tasks, indicating room for significant improvement in language model reasoning.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to ensure the quality of data coming from a physics experiment. Accurately identifying the moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across dimensions. To address the scarcity and unreliability of labelled data, we use the Lorenzetti Simulator to generate synthetic events with injected calorimeter anomalies. We then assess the sensitivity of several time series anomaly detection methods, including transformer-based and other deep learning models. The approach employed here is generic and applicable to different detector designs and defects.

arXiv:2509.14622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive applications, online malicious intent detection has become increasingly critical. However, existing approaches fall short of handling diverse and complex user queries in real time. To address these challenges, we introduce ADRAG (Adversarial Distilled Retrieval-Augmented Guard), a two-stage framework for robust and efficient online malicious intent detection. In the training stage, a high-capacity teacher model is trained on adversarially perturbed, retrieval-augmented inputs to learn robust decision boundaries over diverse and complex user queries. In the inference stage, a distillation scheduler transfers the teacher's knowledge into a compact student model, with a continually updated knowledge base collected online. At deployment, the compact student model leverages top-K similar safety exemplars retrieved from the online-updated knowledge base to enable both online and real-time malicious query detection. Evaluations across ten safety benchmarks demonstrate that ADRAG, with a 149M-parameter model, achieves 98.5% of WildGuard-7B's performance, surpasses GPT-4 by 3.3% and Llama-Guard-3-8B by 9.5% on out-of-distribution detection, while simultaneously delivering up to 5.6x lower latency at 300 queries per second (QPS) in real-time applications.

arXiv:2509.19382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.

Abstract: API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.

<title>Combinatorial Creativity: A New Frontier in Generalization Abilities</title>

arXiv:2509.21043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Despite its similarities to compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence.

<title>Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

arXiv:2510.01176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time, which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed. We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

<title>Keep It on a Leash: Controllable Pseudo-label Generation Towards Realistic Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03993</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03993v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed). However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to $\textbf{15.97%}$ in accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/yaxinhou/CPG.

Abstract: We prove a saturation theorem for linearized shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks on the unit sphere $\mathbb S^d$. For any antipodally quasi-uniform set of centers, if the target function has smoothness $r>\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2}$, then the best $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb S^d)$ approximation cannot converge faster than order $n^{-\frac{d+2k+1}{2d}}$. This lower bound matches existing upper bounds, thereby establishing the exact saturation order $\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2d}$ for such networks. Our results place linearized neural-network approximation firmly within the classical saturation framework and show that, although ReLU$^k$ networks outperform finite elements under equal degrees $k$, this advantage is intrinsically limited.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other visual media.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a social welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and social welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

<title>SimKey: A Semantically Aware Key Module for Watermarking Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12828</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of text generated by large language models (LLMs) makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish authentic human writing from machine output. Watermarking offers a promising solution: model owners can embed an imperceptible signal into generated text, marking its origin. Most leading approaches seed an LLM's next-token sampling with a pseudo-random key that can later be recovered to identify the text as machine-generated, while only minimally altering the model's output distribution. However, these methods suffer from two related issues: (i) watermarks are brittle to simple surface-level edits such as paraphrasing or reordering; and (ii) adversaries can append unrelated, potentially harmful text that inherits the watermark, risking reputational damage to model owners. To address these issues, we introduce SimKey, a semantic key module that strengthens watermark robustness by tying key generation to the meaning of prior context. SimKey uses locality-sensitive hashing over semantic embeddings to ensure that paraphrased text yields the same watermark key, while unrelated or semantically shifted text produces a different one. Integrated with state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, SimKey improves watermark robustness to paraphrasing and translation while preventing harmful content from false attribution, establishing semantic-aware keying as a practical and extensible watermarking direction.

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained by supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.

<title>Stable but Miscalibrated: A Kantian View on Overconfidence from Filters to Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models (LLMs), we observe preliminary correlations between internal fragility and miscalibration or hallucination (confabulation), and find that lightweight critique prompts may modestly improve or worsen calibration in small-scale tests. These results suggest a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled lens to diagnose and potentially mitigate overconfidence in reasoning systems.

<title>Beyond PCA: Manifold Dimension Estimation via Local Graph Structure</title>

Abstract: Local principal component analysis (Local PCA) has proven to be an effective tool for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a manifold. More recently, curvature-adjusted PCA (CA-PCA) has improved upon this approach by explicitly accounting for the curvature of the underlying manifold, rather than assuming local flatness. Building on these insights, we propose a general framework for manifold dimension estimation that captures the manifold's local graph structure by integrating PCA with regression-based techniques. Within this framework, we introduce two representative estimators: quadratic embedding (QE) and total least squares (TLS). Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that these methods perform competitively with, and often outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives.

<title>VO-DP: Semantic-Geometric Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Vision-Only Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0% and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%, outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate, this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP, DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

<title>SpikeFit: Towards Optimal Deployment of Spiking Networks on Neuromorphic Hardware</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware, considering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses that can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints, enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values (M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.

Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks, including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management. Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM. Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next, building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction and selection.

<title>Vision Foundation Models Can Be Good Tokenizers for Latent Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID (w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers). With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of 1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

arXiv:2510.22198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MMbeddings, a probabilistic embedding approach that reinterprets categorical embeddings through the lens of nonlinear mixed models, effectively bridging classical statistical theory with modern deep learning. By treating embeddings as latent random effects within a variational autoencoder framework, our method substantially decreases the number of parameters -- from the conventional embedding approach of cardinality $\times$ embedding dimension, which quickly becomes infeasible with large cardinalities, to a significantly smaller, cardinality-independent number determined primarily by the encoder architecture. This reduction dramatically mitigates overfitting and computational burden in high-cardinality settings. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets, encompassing collaborative filtering and tabular regression tasks using varied architectures, demonstrate that MMbeddings consistently outperforms traditional embeddings, underscoring its potential across diverse machine learning applications.

arXiv:2510.22778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous probabilistic framework that extends denoising diffusion models to the setting of noncommutative random variables. Building on Voiculescu's theory of free entropy and free Fisher information, we formulate diffusion and reverse processes governed by operator-valued stochastic dynamics whose spectral measures evolve by additive convolution. Using tools from free stochastic analysis -- including a Malliavin calculus and a Clark--Ocone representation -- we derive the reverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the conjugate variable, the analogue of the classical score function. The resulting dynamics admit a gradient-flow structure in the noncommutative Wasserstein space, establishing an information-geometric link between entropy production, transport, and deconvolution. We further construct a variational scheme analogous to the Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto (JKO) formulation and prove convergence toward the semicircular equilibrium. The framework provides functional inequalities (free logarithmic Sobolev, Talagrand, and HWI) that quantify entropy dissipation and Wasserstein contraction. These results unify diffusion-based generative modeling with the geometry of operator-valued information, offering a mathematical foundation for generative learning on structured and high-dimensional data.

Summary:
SmartMixed introduces a novel two-phase training strategy for neural networks that allows for optimal per-neuron activation function adaptation while maintaining computational efficiency during inference. The first phase enables neurons to dynamically select from a pool of activation functions, such as ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU, ELU, and SELU, through a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed based on the learned selection, resulting in an efficient network that supports optimized vectorized operations for continued training. Evaluations on the MNIST dataset using varying depth feedforward neural networks illustrate that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct preferences for activation functions, highlighting the functional diversity within neural architectures. <div>

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks, yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional diversity within neural architectures.

Summary:<br /> 
The paper introduces RL-AUX, a reinforcement learning framework for dynamically generating auxiliary tasks in multi-task learning. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on human-labeled auxiliary tasks, which are costly and require domain expertise. RL-AUX assigns auxiliary labels to training examples and rewards the agent for improving performance on the primary task. The framework also explores learning per-example weights for the auxiliary loss. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and other classification datasets demonstrate that the RL method outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and matches the performance of a prominent bi-level optimization baseline. These findings indicate that RL can effectively generate auxiliary tasks, showcasing its potential as a viable approach for enhancing generalization in multi-task learning scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a form of multi-task learning in which a model trains on auxiliary tasks to boost performance on a primary objective. While AL has improved generalization across domains such as navigation, image classification, and NLP, it often depends on human-labeled auxiliary tasks that are costly to design and require domain expertise. Meta-learning approaches mitigate this by learning to generate auxiliary tasks, but typically rely on gradient based bi-level optimization, adding substantial computational and implementation overhead. We propose RL-AUX, a reinforcement-learning (RL) framework that dynamically creates auxiliary tasks by assigning auxiliary labels to each training example, rewarding the agent whenever its selections improve the performance on the primary task. We also explore learning per-example weights for the auxiliary loss. On CIFAR-100 grouped into 20 superclasses, our RL method outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and matches the performance of a prominent bi-level optimization baseline. We present similarly strong results on other classification datasets. These results suggest RL is a viable path to generating effective auxiliary tasks.

Summary:  
State space models used as layers in deep neural networks are effective for long-range sequence tasks but challenging to compress post-training. By regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values, the singular values decay rapidly, resulting in compressible models. An algorithm is developed to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training iterations by exploiting the block-diagonal structure of system matrices in the state space model parametrization. Experiments on Long Range Arena benchmarks show that regularized state space layers are up to 10 times more compressible than standard layers while maintaining high accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models. To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system matrices that we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers while maintaining high accuracy.

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) undergo continual pre-training on web data, raising concerns about vulnerability to misinformation. Inspired by the illusory truth effect, researchers investigate if LLMs internalize false facts over time. The study introduces Layer of Truth framework for probing belief dynamics in continually trained LLMs. Results show even minimal exposure to false data can lead to persistent belief shifts in established facts, with susceptibility varying by model size and layer. This suggests a need for robust monitoring of factual integrity during model updates. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.26829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints, model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs. Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range (0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

Summary: 
The article introduces FedPF, a differentially private fair Federated Learning (FL) algorithm that addresses the challenge of ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client data. The algorithm transforms the optimization problem into a zero-sum game where fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. The theoretical analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship between privacy protection and the system's ability to detect and correct demographic biases. The study shows that moderate fairness constraints can initially improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, challenging conventional notions of fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in discrimination while maintaining competitive accuracy. However, the study highlights the inherent tension between privacy and fairness, suggesting that achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully balanced compromises rather than optimizing either in isolation. The source code for the algorithm is publicly accessible on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF}) that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness. Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 % discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at https://github.com/szpsunkk/FedPF.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method for improving lossless inference acceleration in large language models (LLMs). The method leverages dynamically switchable inference acceleration (DSIA) strategies such as layer sparsity and activation quantization to construct speculative draft models. Traditional cascade algorithms are inefficient for self-speculative decoding methods, so the paper presents a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes multi-level draft models based on acceptance rates and latency prediction. CAS-Spec achieves state-of-the-art acceleration, with an average speedup of 1.1x to 2.3x over autoregressive decoding across different LLMs and datasets. DyTC further enhances the speedup by 47% and 48% compared to baseline cascade and tree-based algorithms, respectively. The CAS-Spec method can be easily integrated into existing LLMs and holds promising potential for future acceleration as self-speculative decoding techniques continue to advance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.26843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models (LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods. We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

<div> Bayesian; DCGAN; Generative Adversarial Networks; mode collapse; sample diversity <br />
Summary: <br />
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are known for mode collapse, producing limited outputs. The BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN, addresses this issue by incorporating model uncertainty during the generative process. By using Bayes by Backprop and mean-field variational inference, BI-DCGAN efficiently learns a distribution over network weights and approximates the posterior distribution. The theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, demonstrates that Bayesian modeling enhances sample diversity in GANs. Experiment results on standard benchmarks show that BI-DCGAN generates more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs while maintaining training efficiency. BI-DCGAN is positioned as a scalable solution for applications requiring diversity and uncertainty awareness, bridging the gap where resource-intensive alternatives like diffusion models fall short. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency. BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs, while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models remain too resource-intensive.

<div> ontology, large language model, chemical engineering, generative reasoning, COPE ontology

Summary:
This work introduces a new framework that combines structured domain knowledge with generative reasoning in the field of chemical engineering. The framework integrates a large language model (LLM) with the COPE ontology, guiding model training and inference through various steps including data acquisition, semantic preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping. The system produces templated question-answer pairs for fine-tuning, with a focus on controlling decoding and enforcing syntax and factual grounding through ontology-linked terms. Evaluation metrics measure both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. The framework also incorporates feedback mechanisms and future extensions such as semantic retrieval and iterative validation to enhance interpretability and reliability. By combining symbolic structure with neural generation, this approach offers a transparent and auditable method for utilizing LLMs in applications related to process control, safety analysis, and other critical engineering tasks.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM) framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other critical engineering contexts.

<div> Keywords: decarbonization, electric vehicles, charging behavior, forecasting, grid resilience

Summary: 
This article presents a framework that combines clustering with few-shot forecasting to analyze charging behavior in electric vehicles (EVs) to support decarbonization efforts in transportation. By utilizing a novel large-scale dataset, the framework can identify site archetypes and develop archetype-specific expert models for forecasting charging demand. The results show that these expert models outperform global baselines in predicting demand at new charging sites. This approach enables operators to optimize energy and pricing strategies, reduce costs, and improve grid resilience, all crucial factors for achieving climate goals. This research addresses the limitations of existing studies, such as small datasets and simplistic modeling approaches, providing a more accurate and practical method for infrastructure segmentation and planning in the transition to electric vehicles.

arXiv:2510.26910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

<div> Keywords: Large Vision-Language Models, Association Intelligence, MM-OPERA Benchmark, LVLMs, Open-ended tasks

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Association Intelligence, a key aspect of human cognition essential for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks in AI often fall short in evaluating open-ended association reasoning, which is crucial for real-world applications. To address this gap, the authors present MM-OPERA, a comprehensive benchmark comprising two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association (ICA), designed to assess LVLMs' ability to perform divergent thinking and convergent associative reasoning. The benchmark challenges LVLMs to provide free-form responses and explicit reasoning paths, mirroring human-like cognitive processes. By analyzing state-of-the-art LVLMs on the MM-OPERA benchmark, the authors uncover limitations in current models' associative reasoning capabilities. The findings pave the way for the development of more human-like and versatile AI systems. The dataset and code for MM-OPERA are publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are evaluated on the MM-OPERA benchmark, which focuses on Association Intelligence assessment through open-ended tasks. The benchmark challenges LVLMs to exhibit divergent thinking and convergent associative reasoning akin to human cognition. Analysis of LVLM performance reveals limitations in their associative reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for more human-like AI systems. The MM-OPERA dataset and code are available for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2510.26937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress. However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks, often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association (ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains, languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for more human-like and general-purpose AI.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article examines the impact of location prediction models on different user groups, uncovering significant demographic disparities. It introduces the Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS) strategy, which prioritizes users based on expected performance gains and group representation. Through the Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM) clustering method, it assigns proxy racial labels to users, enabling the reduction of demographic performance gaps during data collection. By implementing these fairness-aware strategies, the study demonstrates up to a 40% reduction in performance disparities between racial and ethnic groups in mobility prediction models. The findings highlight the potential for lightweight, data-centric interventions to enhance fairness and accuracy in prediction pipelines, particularly in low-resource settings. <div>
arXiv:2510.26940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data applications.

Summary:  
The article argues that the original Turing Test is no longer sufficient to differentiate between human and machine intelligence due to advanced AI systems passing it and posing ethical and environmental concerns. A proposed new test expands on the imitation game by considering the energy expended in answering questions, connecting intelligence assessment to efficiency and resource usage. This revised test provides a measurable benchmark lacking in the original test, prompting society to evaluate the time saved by AI against its overall resource consumption. By incorporating an energy constraint, the new test aims to address the real-world implications of artificial intelligence and encourage a more nuanced understanding of intelligence evaluation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.26954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources. Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial intelligence against its total resource cost.

<div> Keywords: household water consumption, urban analytics, satellite imagery, Google Street View, geospatial data

Summary:<br />
- The study explores the use of publicly available imagery and geospatial data to predict household water consumption in rapidly urbanizing areas.
- Four approaches are compared: survey-based features, CNN embeddings, GSV segmentation, and GSV semantic maps with auxiliary data.
- GSV segmentation combined with remote-sensing covariates achieved 0.55 accuracy for predicting water use, approaching survey-based models.
- Error analysis reveals high precision at the extremes of water consumption distribution but confusion in middle classes due to overlapping visual proxies.
- Comparison of household water consumption estimates with subjective income suggests the potential for open-access imagery to provide reliable data for urban analytics applications.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.26957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV) segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features (benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery, coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban analytics.

Summary:
This work addresses the challenge of maximizing the efficacy of iterative adversarial attacks within a limited computation budget. By introducing a control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations at different levels, the researchers were able to achieve superior performance compared to existing methods while staying within the budget constraints. The proposed method consistently outperformed baselines in experiments and showed comparable results when integrated into adversarial training with only a fraction of the original budget. This fine-grained approach allows for optimizing attack effectiveness while minimizing costs, demonstrating the potential for enhancing AI safety research under resource limitations. <div>
arXiv:2510.26981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost. Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable performance with only 30% of the original budget.

<div> adaptation, review-based recommender systems, language models, aspect-opinion triples, explainable recommendation

Summary:
The Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF) is proposed to address limitations in current methods for extracting information from free-form reviews using large language models. The framework consists of two stages - inducing a compact aspect vocabulary and extracting structured aspect-opinion triples. New metrics, Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR), are introduced to evaluate the fidelity of the representations obtained. The study finds a nonmonotonic relationship between hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments demonstrate that integrating HADSF into rating predictors leads to reduced prediction error and enables smaller models to perform competitively. The code, data pipelines, and metric implementations are released to facilitate reproducible research in the field. The research opens up avenues for more effective and explainable recommendation systems enhanced by large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.26994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation.

Summary: 
This article introduces a theoretical framework that views learning rules as policies for navigating loss landscapes, with optimal rules being solutions to an optimal control problem. It explains the emergence of various well-known rules such as gradient descent, momentum, and natural gradients based on different assumptions. Non-gradient rules are derived from partial controllability, while adaptive optimizers like Adam stem from online Bayesian inference. The framework also elucidates continual learning strategies like weight resetting as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these phenomena under a single objective, this framework clarifies the computational structure of learning and provides a principled basis for designing adaptive algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2510.26997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem. A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization, momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive algorithms.

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenges in evaluating and comparing multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms, particularly the variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB. The research focuses on how to reliably observe performance differences between bandit algorithms and under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. The authors present a reproducible evaluation framework that systematically compares eight classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation includes defined experimental setups, multiple performance metrics, and an interactive interface for consistent analysis. The study shows that variance-aware algorithms excel in high uncertainty settings with subtle differences in arm rewards, while classical algorithms perform better in separable scenarios or with extensive fine-tuning. The contributions of the research are a systematic evaluation framework for MAB algorithms and insights into the conditions favoring variance-aware approaches over classical ones. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.27001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework, implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2) insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform their classical counterparts.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) framework to elucidate the dynamics of expert specialization and attention alignment in transformer models, enhancing efficiency. Through a three-stage training algorithm, the gating network continuously trains to govern transformer experts, showing distinct task specialization and successful data routing. Expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts, improving convergence speed significantly to near-zero prediction loss in logarithmic iteration steps. The training process ensures strong convexity for each subtask, providing practical guidance for developing efficient large-scale models. Experimental validation confirms the theoretical assertions, highlighting the practical effectiveness of the MoT framework. Overall, the study offers a cohesive theoretical understanding of transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, with implications for the design of efficient models at scale.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.27004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network, and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT. Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

The researchers provide quantitative bounds on the necessary training length for LG to occur. They analyze LG in various problem settings, such as error control, attention mechanisms, and transformer architecture. The study shows that LG occurs when the transformer's behavior on longer sequences can be simulated by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training.

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al. (2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer, and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be "simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

<div> Keywords: Mathematical reasoning, large language models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards, Activity Scheduling, Longest Increasing Subsequence

Summary:
Mathematical reasoning poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring accurate answers and faithful reasoning processes. The study explores the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in enhancing mathematical reasoning on two combinatorial problems: Activity Scheduling and the Longest Increasing Subsequence. By utilizing carefully curated datasets with unique optima, the research evaluates multiple reward designs and observes that while RLVR boosts evaluation metrics, it often reinforces superficial heuristics rather than developing new reasoning strategies. This emphasizes the limitations of RLVR generalization and underscores the need for benchmarks that can separate genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation. The code for the study is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Mathematical reasoning is a complex challenge for large language models.
- Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) shows promise in improving reasoning capabilities.
- RLVR was tested on Activity Scheduling and Longest Increasing Subsequence problems.
- Results indicate that RLVR enhances evaluation metrics but may prioritize superficial heuristics over new reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress.

<div> consistency training, factuality, refusal, sycophancy, jailbreak
Summary:
Consistency training is proposed as a method to improve the factuality and refusal training of LLMs by making them invariant to irrelevant cues in prompts. Two approaches, Bias-augmented Consistency Training (BCT) and Activation Consistency Training (ACT), are introduced to reduce a model's susceptibility to irrelevant prompts, such as sycophantic responses or jailbreak cues. By focusing on consistency in responses rather than specific outputs, these methods address alignment issues and avoid relying on static datasets for training. BCT proves effective in reducing jailbreak cues, while both BCT and ACT successfully reduce sycophantic responses. This approach offers a simplified training pipeline and argues that alignment problems can be viewed as consistency issues rather than optimal responses. <div>
arXiv:2510.27062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on algorithm similarity.

Abstract: We present MLPerf Automotive, the first standardized public benchmark for evaluating Machine Learning systems that are deployed for AI acceleration in automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in automotive machine learning systems. Existing benchmark suites cannot be utilized for these systems since automotive workloads have unique constraints including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object detection, 2D semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection. We describe the methodology behind the benchmark design including the task selection, reference models, and submission rules. We also discuss the first round of benchmark submissions and the challenges involved in acquiring the datasets and the engineering efforts to develop the reference implementations.

arXiv:2510.27072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training, where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math reasoning through self-play.

<div> framework, representation-learning, neural data, intracranial recordings, transformer <br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a novel framework for aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects, addressing challenges posed by varying electrode count and placement. The framework utilizes a Siamese encoder to learn a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from multi-region local field potentials. By tokenizing these embeddings for a transformer model, inter-regional relationships with a variable number of channels are effectively modeled. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 20 subjects, showing accurate within-subject discrimination and clear region-consistent clusters in the learned functional space. Additionally, the transformer captured cross-region dependencies and allowed for the reconstruction of masked channels without subject-specific supervision. These results suggest a promising approach for large-scale cross-subject aggregation and pretraining of intracranial neural data, especially where uniform sensor placement and task structure are unavailable. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference, but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i) learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear, region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding. Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

arXiv:2510.27091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However, most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

The article introduces a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk RNA-seq data into cell-type expression profiles and proportions, using a single-cell reference. Applied to human endometrial tissue throughout the menstrual cycle, the model reveals dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions. It identifies cell-type-specific gene expression changes linked to endometrial function, such as decidualization markers in stromal cells during the secretory phase. The model's performance is validated with simulations and comparisons to existing methods, demonstrating resilience to reference mismatches and noise.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions, leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure, priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally, we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions, including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

arXiv:2510.27123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while maintaining competitive overall performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs) coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed loops. We provide a conceptual and technical overview of agentic AI architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery, including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability, compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.

While essay-based scoring generally performed better than rationale-based scoring, the latter showed higher accuracy for less represented scores due to class imbalance.

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same. Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848 reported in literature.

<br />
FairAD is introduced as a computationally efficient method for fair graph clustering that addresses concerns of unsavory behaviors of machine learning models towards certain demographic groups. The method constructs a new affinity matrix using algebraic distance to impose fairness constraints and performs a graph coarsening process to identify representative nodes for clustering. By solving a constrained minimization problem, FairAD achieves fair clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to existing algorithms. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FairAD in achieving fair clustering outcomes.

arXiv:2510.27136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms, particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$ clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair graph clustering algorithms.

arXiv:2510.27145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters, limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover, to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics. RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO), which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

Summary:
An adaptor "E" for gradient-based optimizers is proposed to improve the search for lower and better-generalizing minima in deep learning. This adaptor allows the optimizer to continue exploring landscape valleys even after reaching a local minimum, increasing the chances of finding a flatter and lower local minimum for better generalization. The proof of convergence is provided for both convex and non-convex scenarios. The adapted optimizer, ALTO, outperforms the benchmark optimizer Lamb in large-batch training tasks, increasing test accuracy by an average of 2.5%. This research introduces a new direction in optimization algorithm design, highlighting the importance of exploring beyond local minima for improved generalization in deep learning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.27153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning. However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E" for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses) in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario, large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy (generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of 2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

<div> Bayesian Data Scheduler, harmful fine-tuning, large language models, defense strategy, attack simulation <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), a defense strategy for mitigating harmful fine-tuning risks in large language models. Existing defense strategies rely on attack simulations, which have limitations in anticipating unknown attacks and adapting to varying attack settings. BDS addresses these challenges by formulating defense as a Bayesian inference problem, learning the safety attributes of each data point and constraining the fine-tuning process based on these attributes. By leveraging Bayesian inference, BDS can adaptively defend against harmful data without the need for attack simulation. Additionally, a neural scheduler based on amortized Bayesian learning enables efficient transfer to new data without retraining. Experimental results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i) the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii) limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining. Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/Bayesian-Data-Scheduler.

<div> sparse linear regression, online learning, regret bounds, polynomial-time algorithm, feature selection <br />
Summary: 
This paper addresses the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR) where algorithms can only access a limited number of attributes for prediction. The authors introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm that improves regret bounds under the compatibility condition, a weaker assumption than previous works. The algorithm utilizes novel techniques like algorithm-dependent sampling, adaptive parameter tuning, and online Newton steps with careful initializations. The authors provide novel analyses including induction methods for error analysis, covariance analysis of non-independent random variables, and decomposition of regret. The algorithm is extended to OSLR with additional observations, where algorithms can observe more attributes after each prediction, further improving regret bounds from prior works. <div>
arXiv:2510.27177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR) where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector, but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations. We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

Summary: 
The research introduces SERFLOW, a solution for dynamically offloading Machine Learning model partitions across different resource orchestration services. It addresses real-world factors like VM cold starts and long-tail service time distributions by modeling each ML query as traversing stages with different exit rates. SERFLOW leverages FaaS-based serverless functions and stage-specific resource provisioning to optimize resource utilization. It integrates adaptive load balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion, reducing cloud costs by over $23% and efficiently adapting to dynamic workloads. <div>

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However, prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM) cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion, SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to dynamic workloads.

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over 1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.

<div> Feature-Function Curvature Analysis, XAI, machine learning models, model explanation, hierarchical learning<br />
Summary:<br />
Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for building trust in complex machine learning models. Mainstream attribution methods often provide an incomplete and static picture of a model's final state. To address this limitation, Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA) is introduced, which analyzes the geometry of a model's learned function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying its Impact, Volatility, Non-linearity, and Interaction. The Dynamic Archetype Analysis extends this framework by tracking the evolution of these signatures during training, revealing the learning process. Empirical evidence shows models learn simple linear effects before complex interactions, providing insights into model capacity and potential overfitting. FFCA offers a comprehensive analysis of the entire learning process, transforming model explanation into a nuanced and trustworthy approach. <div>

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction. Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel, practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

<div> Keywords: Equivariant representation learning, Invariant representation learning, Soft Task-Aware Routing, Transfer learning tasks, Model capacity.

Summary:
Equivariant representation learning captures input transformations in the representation space, while invariant representation learning focuses on semantic information. The traditional approach of using separate projection heads for these two types of learning may lead to redundant feature learning. Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR) addresses this issue by modeling projection heads as experts that specialize in capturing shared or task-specific information. This reduces redundant feature learning and improves model efficiency. Lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings validate the effectiveness of STAR. Experimental results demonstrate consistent enhancements across various transfer learning tasks. The code for STAR is available on GitHub for implementation and further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.27222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings. Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

Summary: 
FedSM is a client-centric framework that addresses bias in Federated Learning caused by non-IID and long-tail data distributions. It utilizes a pretrained image-text-aligned model to guide the mixing of local features with global prototypes, generating class-consistent pseudo-features to correct classifier bias. The framework employs probabilistic category selection to enhance feature diversity, mitigating biases and potential domain shift issues. All computations are done locally, minimizing server overhead. Through extensive experiments on imbalanced datasets, FedSM consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy, demonstrating high robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection, enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

<div> Dataset distillation, influence functions, data quality, model performance, adaptive weights <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Influence-Weighted Distillation (IWD), a framework that incorporates influence functions to consider data quality in dataset distillation. Unlike existing methods that treat all instances equally, IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on its impact on the distillation objective. This prioritizes useful data while reducing the influence of less relevant or harmful instances. IWD is adaptable and can be integrated into various dataset distillation frameworks. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating IWD leads to improved quality of distilled datasets and enhances model performance, with accuracy gains of up to 7.8%. This approach aims to condense large datasets efficiently while ensuring only valuable data contributes to the training process, ultimately boosting model performance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.27253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets, achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work, we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy gains of up to 7.8%.

Relying on large cloud-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for all queries can result in high latency and energy costs, while small edge models are better suited for simple tasks. To address this, researchers propose ECVL-ROUTER, a scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. This framework dynamically selects the appropriate model based on user requirements, optimizing overall utility. An evaluation dataset is created for router training, and experiments show that over 80% of queries are successfully routed to the small model with less than a 10% drop in problem-solving probability. ECVL-ROUTER aims to balance the trade-offs between fast response times, high-quality outputs, and low energy consumption by leveraging the strengths of both large and small models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However, user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA) as a solution to the quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention in autoregressive language models. HLA is a causal, streaming mechanism that allows for higher interactions through compact prefix sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without the need for creating large matrices. The paper presents closed-form streaming identities and a strictly causal masked variant using additional summaries. A chunk-parallel training scheme based on associative scans is also outlined to reproduce the activations of serial recurrence accurately. HLA is positioned as a scalable building block that combines attention-like data-dependent mixing with the efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Extensions to third and higher orders are also discussed in the paper. The project page for HLA can be found at https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/HLA. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.27258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal, streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any $n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the efficiency of modern recurrent architectures.

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel deep learning model, HiF-DTA, designed for accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) in computational drug discovery. Unlike existing methods, HiF-DTA considers both global sequence semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and proteins. It utilizes a dual-pathway strategy to extract these features and models drugs at multiple scales to capture atomic, substructural, and molecular-level representations. The model also incorporates a multi-scale bilinear attention module for feature fusion. Experimental results on three datasets show that HiF-DTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies confirm the significance of global-local feature extraction and multi-scale fusion in improving prediction accuracy. Overall, HiF-DTA presents a promising approach for enhancing the prediction of Drug-Target Affinity in drug discovery research.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly 3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level, substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural, and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing machine-learning techniques while reducing the reliance on multiple sensing modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

Summary: 
This study focuses on anomaly detection in streaming IoT network traffic using machine learning models. Traditional batch models struggle with concept drift, causing maintenance issues and poor adaptability. The study compares batch and streaming learning approaches, highlighting the failure of batch models to handle concept drift effectively. The researchers simulated heterogeneous network data streams to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms. Tree-based ML algorithms outperformed non-tree-based ones in batch anomaly detection. Adaptive Random Forest achieved a high F1-score with lower computational costs, making it a competitive choice. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree also showed promising results, with reduced computational costs albeit a slight trade-off in stability. The study emphasizes the importance of considering concept drift and traffic heterogeneity when developing anomaly detection models for IoT networks. <div>

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

Summary: 
(1) The study focuses on understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus by introducing un-attributability as a measure of semantic novelty.
(2) A new operational measure of semantic novelty is proposed, where outputs are considered novel if they cannot be attributed to any pretraining example.
(3) The study utilizes a two-stage retrieval pipeline to approximate un-attributability, revealing that models draw on pretraining data across longer spans than previously known.
(4) Some domains are found to either promote or suppress novelty systematically.
(5) Instruction tuning not only affects the style of models but also increases novelty. The findings suggest that reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability allows for efficient analysis at the pretraining scale. The study provides access to important corpus chunks and index artifacts for replication and large-scale extension of the analysis. 

Summary:  <div>

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA) methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference, we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2 and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

<div> Sparse Time Series Encoder, Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion, Bi-Modal Attention, multimodal learning frameworks, MIMIC-IV dataset<br />
Summary:<br />
The MedM2T framework addresses the complexities of modeling medical data with inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures. It combines a Sparse Time Series Encoder for irregular and sparse time series, a Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion for capturing micro- and macro-temporal patterns, and a Bi-Modal Attention for cross-modal interactions. By using modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligning features within a shared encoder, MedM2T effectively bridges granularity gaps between modalities. Evaluation on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for tasks including 90-day CVD prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay regression showed superior performance compared to existing models, achieving impressive metrics such as AUROC of 0.947 for CVD prediction and Mean Absolute Error of 2.31 for LOS regression. The implementation of MedM2T is available on GitHub, positioning it as a promising tool for clinical prediction. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and (iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction; an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at https://github.com/DHLab-TSENG/MedM2T.

<title>Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance. Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially undermining monitoring approaches.

<title>Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

<title>FedMuon: Accelerating Federated Learning with Matrix Orthogonalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27403</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting, Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2) moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1) momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2) steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and controllable at minimal marginal cost.

<title>MVeLMA: Multimodal Vegetation Loss Modeling Architecture for Predicting Post-fire Vegetation Loss</title>

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features. Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors, their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling, making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation \textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery management.

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world data sets.

<title>Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling</title>

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

<title>FedAdamW: A Communication-Efficient Optimizer with Convergence and Generalization Guarantees for Federated Large Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27486</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy. The code is available in https://github.com/junkangLiu0/FedAdamW.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations, and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover, it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all 5 metrics.

<title>DP-FedPGN: Finding Global Flat Minima for Differentially Private Federated Learning via Penalizing Gradient Norm</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27504</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

<title>Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient Solvers on GPUs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27517</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.27517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by 40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior generalization performance.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance, consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the broader time series literature.

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data. Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue, transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered \emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework -- updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be achieved.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2, an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights, and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these, we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3) OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets, limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries, we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual, interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and feasibility across varied financial environments.

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism. Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even leading reasoning models.

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples, respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions, simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes. In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective largely overlooked by existing approaches.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

<title>Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.

Abstract: The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies: the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer. Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for neural network structures with better translation results, we considered perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation metric.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment can benefit from personalized lifestyle prescriptions. However, the delivery of personalized lifestyle medicine prescriptions is limited by the shortage of trained professionals and the variability in physicians' expertise. We propose an offline contextual bandit approach that learns individualized lifestyle prescriptions from the aggregated NHANES profiles of 119,555 participants by minimizing the Magni glucose risk-reward function. The model encodes patient status and generates lifestyle medicine prescriptions, which are trained using a mixed-action Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. The task is treated as a single-step contextual bandit. The model is validated against lifestyle medicine prescriptions issued by three certified physicians from Xiangya Hospital. These results demonstrate that offline mixed-action SAC can generate risk-aware lifestyle medicine prescriptions from cross-sectional NHANES data, warranting prospective clinical validation.

Abstract: Caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often find the 77-item Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) burdensome, limiting its use for routine monitoring. This study introduces a generalizable machine learning framework that seeks to shorten assessments while maintaining evaluative accuracy. Using longitudinal ATEC data from 60 autistic children receiving therapy, we applied feature selection and cross-validation techniques to identify the most predictive items across two assessment goals: longitudinal therapy tracking and point-in-time severity estimation. For progress monitoring, the framework identified 16 items (21% of the original questionnaire) that retained strong correlation with total score change and full subdomain coverage. We also generated smaller subsets (1-7 items) for efficient approximations. For point-in-time severity assessment, our model achieved over 80% classification accuracy using just 13 items (17% of the original set). While demonstrated on ATEC, the methodology-based on subset optimization, model interpretability, and statistical rigor-is broadly applicable to other high-dimensional psychometric tools. The resulting framework could potentially enable more accessible, frequent, and scalable assessments and offer a data-driven approach for AI-supported interventions across neurodevelopmental and psychiatric contexts.

Abstract: Survivors of childhood cancer need lifelong monitoring for side effects from radiotherapy. However, longitudinal data from routine monitoring is often infrequently and irregularly sampled, and subject to inaccuracies. Due to this, measurements are often studied in isolation, or simple relationships (e.g., linear) are used to impute missing timepoints. In this study, we investigated the potential role of Gaussian Processes (GP) modelling to make population-based and individual predictions, using insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) measurements as a test case. With training data of 23 patients with a median (range) of 4 (1-16) timepoints we identified a trend within the range of literature reported values. In addition, with 8 test cases, individual predictions were made with an average root mean squared error of 31.9 (10.1 - 62.3) ng/ml and 27.4 (0.02 - 66.1) ng/ml for two approaches. GP modelling may overcome limitations of routine longitudinal data and facilitate analysis of late effects of radiotherapy.

Abstract: Effective soil health management is crucial for sustaining agriculture, adopting ecosystem resilience, and preserving water quality. However, Missouri's diverse landscapes limit the effectiveness of broad generalized management recommendations. The lack of resolution in existing soil grouping systems necessitates data driven, site specific insights to guide tailored interventions. To address these critical challenges, a regional soil clustering framework designed to support precision soil health management strategies across the state. The methodology leveraged high resolution SSURGO dataset, explicitly processing soil properties aggregated across the 0 to 30 cm root zone. Multivariate analysis incorporating a variational autoencoder and KMeans clustering was used to group soils with similar properties. The derived clusters were validated using statistical metrics, including silhouette scores and checks against existing taxonomic units, to confirm their spatial coherence. This approach enabled us to delineate soil groups that capture textures, hydraulic properties, chemical fertility, and biological indicators unique to Missouri's diverse agroecological regions. The clustering map identified ten distinct soil health management zones. This alignment of 10 clusters was selected as optimal because it was sufficiently large to capture inherited soil patterns while remaining manageable for practical statewide application. Rooting depth limitation and saturated hydraulic conductivity emerged as principal variables driving soil differentiation. Each management zone is defined by a unique combination of clay, organic matter, pH, and available water capacity. This framework bridges sophisticated data analysis with actionable, site targeted recommendations, enabling conservation planners, and agronomists to optimize management practices and enhance resource efficiency statewide.

Abstract: We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: LLM serving systems process heterogeneous query workloads where different categories exhibit different characteristics. Code queries cluster densely in embedding space while conversational queries distribute sparsely. Content staleness varies from minutes (stock data) to months (code patterns). Query repetition patterns range from power-law (code) to uniform (conversation), producing long tail cache hit rate distributions: high-repetition categories achieve 40-60% hit rates while low-repetition or volatile categories achieve 5-15% hit rates. Vector databases must exclude the long tail because remote search costs (30ms) require 15--20% hit rates to break even, leaving 20-30% of production traffic uncached. Uniform cache policies compound this problem: fixed thresholds cause false positives in dense spaces and miss valid paraphrases in sparse spaces; fixed TTLs waste memory or serve stale data. This paper presents category-aware semantic caching where similarity thresholds, TTLs, and quotas vary by query category. We present a hybrid architecture separating in-memory HNSW search from external document storage, reducing miss cost from 30ms to 2ms. This reduction makes low-hit-rate categories economically viable (break-even at 3-5% versus 15-20%), enabling cache coverage across the entire workload distribution. Adaptive load-based policies extend this framework to respond to downstream model load, dynamically adjusting thresholds and TTLs to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% in theoretical projections.

Abstract: Automated monitoring of marine mammals in the St. Lawrence Estuary faces extreme challenges: calls span low-frequency moans to ultrasonic clicks, often overlap, and are embedded in variable anthropogenic and environmental noise. We introduce a multi-step, attention-guided framework that first segments spectrograms to generate soft masks of biologically relevant energy and then fuses these masks with the raw inputs for multi-band, denoised classification. Image and mask embeddings are integrated via mid-level fusion, enabling the model to focus on salient spectrogram regions while preserving global context. Using real-world recordings from the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park Research Station in Canada, we demonstrate that segmentation-driven attention and mid-level fusion improve signal discrimination, reduce false positive detections, and produce reliable representations for operational marine mammal monitoring across diverse environmental conditions and signal-to-noise ratios. Beyond in-distribution evaluation, we further assess the generalization of Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) under distributional shifts by testing on spectrograms generated with alternative acoustic transformations. While high-capacity baseline models lose accuracy in this Out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, MGC maintains stable performance, with even simple fusion mechanisms (gated, concat) achieving comparable results across distributions. This robustness highlights the capacity of MGC to learn transferable representations rather than overfitting to a specific transformation, thereby reinforcing its suitability for large-scale, real-world biodiversity monitoring. We show that in all experimental settings, the MGC framework consistently outperforms baseline architectures, yielding substantial gains in accuracy on both in-distribution and OOD data.

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and the full app will be deployed on the cloud.

<title>LLMs are Overconfident: Evaluating Confidence Interval Calibration with FermiEval</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at numerical estimation but struggle to correctly quantify uncertainty. We study how well LLMs construct confidence intervals around their own answers and find that they are systematically overconfident. To evaluate this behavior, we introduce FermiEval, a benchmark of Fermi-style estimation questions with a rigorous scoring rule for confidence interval coverage and sharpness. Across several modern models, nominal 99\% intervals cover the true answer only 65\% of the time on average. With a conformal prediction based approach that adjusts the intervals, we obtain accurate 99\% observed coverage, and the Winkler interval score decreases by 54\%. We also propose direct log-probability elicitation and quantile adjustment methods, which further reduce overconfidence at high confidence levels. Finally, we develop a perception-tunnel theory explaining why LLMs exhibit overconfidence: when reasoning under uncertainty, they act as if sampling from a truncated region of their inferred distribution, neglecting its tails.

Abstract: Online communities for sports fans have surged in popularity, with Reddit's r/PremierLeague emerging as a focal point for fans of one of the globe's most celebrated sports leagues. This boom has helped the Premier League make significant inroads into the US market, increasing viewership and sparking greater interest in its matches. Despite the league's broad appeal, there's still a notable gap in understanding its online fan community. Therefore, we analyzed a substantial dataset of over 1.1 million comments posted from 2013-2022 on r/PremierLeague. Our study delves into the sentiment, topics, and toxicity of these discussions, tracking trends over time, aiming to map out the conversation landscape. The rapid expansion has brought more diverse discussions, but also a worrying rise in negative sentiment and toxicity. Additionally, the subreddit has become a venue for users to voice frustrations about broader societal issues like racism, the COVID-19 pandemic, and political tensions.

<title>Causal Masking on Spatial Data: An Information-Theoretic Case for Learning Spatial Datasets with Unimodal Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which naturally supports both representations. We train language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} - consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data, and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

arXiv:2510.27018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating the solutions of boundary value problems governed by partial differential equations with neural networks is challenging, largely due to the difficult training process. This difficulty can be partly explained by the spectral bias, that is, the slower convergence of high-frequency components, and can be mitigated by localizing neural networks via (overlapping) domain decomposition. We combine this localization with the Gauss-Newton method as the optimizer to obtain faster convergence than gradient-based schemes such as Adam; this comes at the cost of solving an ill-conditioned linear system in each iteration. Domain decomposition induces a block-sparse structure in the otherwise dense Gauss-Newton system, reducing the computational cost per iteration. Our numerical results indicate that combining localization and Gauss-Newton optimization is promising for neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations.

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model (ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly outperform existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate protein structure and sequence have achieved remarkable success in protein-protein interface prediction. However, extending these methods to protein-peptide interactions remains challenging due to the inherent conformational flexibility of peptides and the limited availability of structural data that hinder direct training of structure-aware models. To address these limitations, we introduce GeoPep, a novel framework for peptide binding site prediction that leverages transfer learning from ESM3, a multimodal protein foundation model. GeoPep fine-tunes ESM3's rich pre-learned representations from protein-protein binding to address the limited availability of protein-peptide binding data. The fine-tuned model is further integrated with a parameter-efficient neural network architecture capable of learning complex patterns from sparse data. Furthermore, the model is trained using distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information to enhance binding site prediction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding site prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding patterns.

<title>e1: Learning Adaptive Control of Reasoning Effort</title>

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training.

Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations. We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors (3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size, and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\% gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel, transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback, navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production. This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

Abstract: This study explores the classification error of Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA) in scenarios where the number of mixture components exceeds those present in the actual data distribution, a condition known as overspecification. We use a two-component Gaussian mixture model within each class to fit data generated from a single Gaussian, analyzing both the algorithmic convergence of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the statistical classification error. We demonstrate that, with suitable initialization, the EM algorithm converges exponentially fast to the Bayes risk at the population level. Further, we extend our results to finite samples, showing that the classification error converges to Bayes risk with a rate $n^{-1/2}$ under mild conditions on the initial parameter estimates and sample size. This work provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the performance of overspecified MDA, which is often used empirically in complex data settings, such as image and text classification. To validate our theory, we conduct experiments on remote sensing datasets.

Abstract: Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization due to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning. Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including visual distractions and lighting variations.

Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.

Abstract: Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems such as the ASTRI Mini-Array. The system enhances quality control, predictive maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods: ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana, Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage, minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally, ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management. Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Traditional numerical integrators often face a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, while existing neural network-based approaches typically require training a separate model for each case. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel multi-modal foundation model for large-scale simulations of differential equations: FMint-SDE (Foundation Model based on Initialization for stochastic differential equations). Based on a decoder-only transformer with in-context learning, FMint-SDE leverages numerical and textual modalities to learn a universal error-correction scheme. It is trained using prompted sequences of coarse solutions generated by conventional solvers, enabling broad generalization across diverse systems. We evaluate our models on a suite of challenging SDE benchmarks spanning applications in molecular dynamics, mechanical systems, finance, and biology. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to classical solvers, underscoring the potential of FMint-SDE as a general-purpose simulation tool for dynamical systems.

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints. However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge transfer.

arXiv:2510.27213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging, mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship between previously learned knowledge and new information across different training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images. Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other approaches.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource, non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3% preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged Q&amp;A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual alignment in lightweight LLMs.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality: pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques, designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3 dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities. Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap, performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

Abstract: Drug recommendation (DR) systems aim to support healthcare professionals in selecting appropriate medications based on patients' medical conditions. State-of-the-art approaches utilize deep learning techniques for improving DR, but fall short in providing any insights on the derivation process of recommendations -- a critical limitation in such high-stake applications. We propose TraceDR, a novel DR system operating over a medical knowledge graph (MKG), which ensures access to large-scale and high-quality information. TraceDR simultaneously predicts drug recommendations and related evidence within a multi-task learning framework, enabling traceability of medication recommendations. For covering a more diverse set of diseases and drugs than existing works, we devise a framework for automatically constructing patient health records and release DrugRec, a new large-scale testbed for DR.

<title>FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

<title>When AI Trading Agents Compete: Adverse Selection of Meta-Orders by Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making</title>

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are intelligent filtering methods that suggest items to users based on their inferred preferences, derived from their interaction history on the platform. Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on users past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is new to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical data available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To address this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial ratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early understanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally categorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision tree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about their preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is gathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach for rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i) elicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres to better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at each node to more effectively learn user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed enhancements lead to improved performance, particularly with a reduced number of queries.

<title>FPS: Feedforward-based Parameter Selection For Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters [1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2] require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) method in generative modeling maps arbitrary probability distributions by constructing an interpolation between them and then learning the vector field that defines ODE for this interpolation. Recently, it was shown that FM can be modified to map distributions optimally in terms of the quadratic cost function for any initial interpolation. To achieve this, only specific optimal vector fields, which are typical for solutions of Optimal Transport (OT) problems, need to be considered during FM loss minimization. In this note, we show that considering only optimal vector fields can lead to OT in another approach: Action Matching (AM). Unlike FM, which learns a vector field for a manually chosen interpolation between given distributions, AM learns the vector field that defines ODE for an entire given sequence of distributions.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities. Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold. Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Abstract: Despite their enormous predictive power, machine learning models are often unsuitable for applications in regulated industries such as finance, due to their limited capacity to provide explanations. While model-agnostic frameworks such as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely align with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after. Counterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of which circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome, may be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate counterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features are most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of counterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning, exploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model itself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the explanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are crossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this method on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit dataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more useful than Shapley values.

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum, Elev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in estimating total biomass per plot.

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric two-sample testing using the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. While prior theoretical and empirical work indicates that the SW distance offers a promising balance between strong statistical guarantees and computational efficiency, its theoretical foundations for hypothesis testing remain limited. We address this gap by proposing a permutation-based SW test and analyzing its performance. The test inherits finite-sample Type I error control from the permutation principle. Moreover, we establish non-asymptotic power bounds and show that the procedure achieves the minimax separation rate $n^{-1/2}$ over multinomial and bounded-support alternatives, matching the optimal guarantees of kernel-based tests while building on the geometric foundations of Wasserstein distances. Our analysis further quantifies the trade-off between the number of projections and statistical power. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the test combines finite-sample validity with competitive power and scalability, and -- unlike kernel-based tests, which require careful kernel tuning -- it performs consistently well across all scenarios we consider.

<title>pDANSE: Particle-based Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation from Nonlinear Measurements</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose underlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred to as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides parameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free process, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of DANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for the state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system renders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics of the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed at the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a reparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the second-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred to as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential measurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the semi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised learning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system as a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation performance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic nonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is used; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and Cartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The performance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\`a-vis particle filters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.

<title>Asynchronous Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Packet Routing for Ultra-Dense LEO Satellite Networks</title>

Abstract: The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous network environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and significant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing algorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse and often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However, existing methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on impractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To tackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing framework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on its own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case performance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved by enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS objectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO constellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively optimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious baseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms end-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by resolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion avoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust routing.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about 68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability, and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution for real-world text summarization applications.

Abstract: Understanding the structural and cognitive underpinnings of musical compositions remains a key challenge in music theory and computational musicology. While traditional methods focus on harmony and rhythm, cognitive models such as the Implication-Realization (I-R) model and Temporal Gestalt theory offer insight into how listeners perceive and anticipate musical structure. This study presents a graph-based computational approach that operationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and annotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic Time Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and inter-segment relationships.
  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further labeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor I-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level. This labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive information, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and resolution.
  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within compositions. Results reveal statistically significant distinctions between intra- and inter-graph structures. Segment-level analysis via multidimensional scaling confirms that structural similarity at the graph level reflects perceptual similarity at the segment level. Graph2vec embeddings and clustering demonstrate that these representations capture stylistic and structural features that extend beyond composer identity.
  These findings highlight the potential of graph-based methods as a structured, cognitively informed framework for computational music analysis, enabling a more nuanced understanding of musical structure and style through the lens of listener perception.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical success in generating high-quality samples from target data distributions. Among them, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is one of the most widely used samplers, generating samples via estimated score functions. Despite its empirical success, a tight theoretical understanding of DDPM -- especially its convergence properties -- remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a refined convergence analysis of the DDPM sampler and establish near-optimal convergence rates under general distributional assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a relaxed smoothness condition parameterized by a constant $L$, which is small for many practical distributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). We prove that the DDPM sampler with accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of $$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\min\{d,L^2\}}{T^2}\right)~\text{in Kullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the number of iterations, and $\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$. This result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L < \sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence analysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions. Moreover, it reveals that DDPM and DDIM share the same dependence on $d$, raising an interesting question of why DDIM often appears empirically faster.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training. Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data. Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

Abstract: We consider the task of constructing a data structure for associating a static set of keys with values, while allowing arbitrary output values for queries involving keys outside the set. Compared to hash tables, these so-called static function data structures do not need to store the key set and thus use significantly less memory. Several techniques are known, with compressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the value sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use machine learning to capture correlations between keys and values. For each key, a model predicts a probability distribution over the values, from which we derive a key-specific prefix code to compactly encode the true value. The resulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure. This design allows learned static functions to break the zero-order entropy barrier while still supporting point queries. Our experiments show substantial space savings: up to one order of magnitude on real data, and up to three orders of magnitude on synthetic data.

Abstract: Modern software systems increasingly integrate machine learning (ML) due to its advancements and ability to enhance data-driven decision-making. However, this integration introduces significant challenges for software engineering, especially in software product lines (SPLs), where managing variability and reuse becomes more complex with the inclusion of ML components. Although existing approaches have addressed variability management in SPLs and the integration of ML components in isolated systems, few have explored the intersection of both domains. Specifically, there is limited support for modeling and managing variability in SPLs that incorporate ML components. To bridge this gap, this article proposes a structured framework designed to extend Software Product Line engineering, facilitating the integration of ML components. It facilitates the design of SPLs with ML capabilities by enabling systematic modeling of variability and reuse. The proposal has been partially implemented with the VariaMos tool.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms, particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19 dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization on networks modeled as metric graphs. Motivated by applications where the objective function is expensive to evaluate or only available as a black box, we develop Bayesian optimization algorithms that sequentially update a Gaussian process surrogate model of the objective to guide the acquisition of query points. To ensure that the surrogates are tailored to the network's geometry, we adopt Whittle-Mat\'ern Gaussian process prior models defined via stochastic partial differential equations on metric graphs. In addition to establishing regret bounds for optimizing sufficiently smooth objective functions, we analyze the practical case in which the smoothness of the objective is unknown and the Whittle-Mat\'ern prior is represented using finite elements. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for optimizing benchmark objective functions on a synthetic metric graph and for Bayesian inversion via maximum a posteriori estimation on a telecommunication network.

Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection accuracy with a low computational cost.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a practical tool for SBDD.

<title>On Selecting Few-Shot Examples for LLM-based Code Vulnerability Detection</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for many coding tasks, including summarization, translation, completion, and code generation. However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task for LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning (ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct answers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However, choosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model performance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot examples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first criterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a sample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about its usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity of the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples based on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations to determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under various combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of 26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI) radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI, or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels.Results show that the DFI-only model achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51 percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus 92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is unavailable.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway towards ultra-efficient language models. Code: https://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is the standard way of speeding up machine learning training, and most of the research in the area focuses on distributed first-order, gradient-based methods. Yet, there are settings where some computationally-bounded nodes may not be able to implement first-order, gradient-based optimization, while they could still contribute to joint optimization tasks. In this paper, we initiate the study of hybrid decentralized optimization, studying settings where nodes with zeroth-order and first-order optimization capabilities co-exist in a distributed system, and attempt to jointly solve an optimization task over some data distribution. We essentially show that, under reasonable parameter settings, such a system can not only withstand noisier zeroth-order agents but can even benefit from integrating such agents into the optimization process, rather than ignoring their information. At the core of our approach is a new analysis of distributed optimization with noisy and possibly-biased gradient estimators, which may be of independent interest. Our results hold for both convex and non-convex objectives. Experimental results on standard optimization tasks confirm our analysis, showing that hybrid first-zeroth order optimization can be practical, even when training deep neural networks.

Abstract: Stochastic and adversarial data are two widely studied settings in online learning. But many optimization tasks are neither i.i.d. nor fully adversarial, which makes it of fundamental interest to get a better theoretical understanding of the world between these extremes. In this work we establish novel regret bounds for online convex optimization in a setting that interpolates between stochastic i.i.d. and fully adversarial losses. By exploiting smoothness of the expected losses, these bounds replace a dependence on the maximum gradient length by the variance of the gradients, which was previously known only for linear losses. In addition, they weaken the i.i.d. assumption by allowing, for example, adversarially poisoned rounds, which were previously considered in the related expert and bandit settings. In the fully i.i.d. case, our regret bounds match the rates one would expect from results in stochastic acceleration, and we also recover the optimal stochastically accelerated rates via online-to-batch conversion. In the fully adversarial case our bounds gracefully deteriorate to match the minimax regret. We further provide lower bounds showing that our regret upper bounds are tight for all intermediate regimes in terms of the stochastic variance and the adversarial variation of the loss gradients.

Abstract: Online healthcare consultations have transformed how patients seek medical advice, offering convenience while introducing new challenges for ensuring consultation success. Predicting whether an online consultation will be successful is critical for improving patient experiences and sustaining platform competitiveness. Yet, such prediction is inherently difficult due to the fragmented nature of patients' care journeys and the lack of integration between virtual and traditional healthcare systems. Furthermore, the data collected from online platforms, including textual conversations, interaction sequences, and behavioral traces, are often sparse and incomplete. This study develops a predictive modeling approach that fuses multimodal data and dynamically constructed knowledge networks to capture latent relationships among patients, physicians, and consultation contexts. By integrating heterogeneous information sources and uncovering the evolving structure of digital interactions, the model enhances the accuracy and interpretability of consultation success prediction. The findings offer implications for designing hybrid healthcare ecosystems that combine online and offline services through data-driven intelligence.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a general framework for tractable deep generative models, which support exact and efficient probabilistic inference on their learned distributions. Recent modeling and training advancements have enabled their application to complex real-world tasks. However, the time and memory inefficiency of existing PC implementations hinders further scaling up. This paper proposes PyJuice, a general GPU implementation design for PCs that improves prior art in several regards. Specifically, PyJuice is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing systems (including very recent ones) at training large-scale PCs. Moreover, PyJuice consumes 2-5x less GPU memory, which enables us to train larger models. At the core of our system is a compilation process that converts a PC into a compact representation amenable to efficient block-based parallelization, which significantly reduces IO and makes it possible to leverage Tensor Cores available in modern GPUs. Empirically, PyJuice can be used to improve state-of-the-art PCs trained on image (e.g., ImageNet32) and language (e.g., WikiText, CommonGen) datasets. We further establish a new set of baselines on natural image and language datasets by benchmarking existing PC structures but with much larger sizes and more training epochs, with the hope of incentivizing future research. Code is available at https://github.com/Tractables/pyjuice.

Abstract: There is a significant gap between our theoretical understanding of optimization algorithms used in deep learning and their practical performance. Theoretical development usually focuses on proving convergence guarantees under a variety of different assumptions, which are themselves often chosen based on a rough combination of intuitive match to practice and analytical convenience. In this paper, we carefully measure the degree to which the standard optimization analyses are capable of explaining modern algorithms. To do this, we develop new empirical metrics that compare real optimization behavior with analytically predicted behavior. Our investigation is notable for its tight integration with modern optimization analysis: rather than simply checking high-level assumptions made in the analysis (e.g. smoothness), we also verify key low-level identities used by the analysis to explain optimization behavior that might hold even if the high-level motivating assumptions do not. Notably, we find that smoothness-based analyses fail in practice under most scenarios, but the key identities commonly used in convex-optimization analyses often hold in practice despite the objective's global non-convexity.

Abstract: Prior work has shown that text-conditioned diffusion models can learn to identify and manipulate primitive concepts underlying a compositional data-generating process, enabling generalization to entirely novel, out-of-distribution compositions. Beyond performance evaluations, these studies develop a rich empirical phenomenology of learning dynamics, showing that models generalize sequentially, respecting the compositional hierarchy of the data-generating process. Moreover, concept-centric structures within the data significantly influence a model's speed of learning the ability to manipulate a concept. In this paper, we aim to better characterize these empirical results from a theoretical standpoint. Specifically, we propose an abstraction of prior work's compositional generalization problem by introducing a structured identity mapping (SIM) task, where a model is trained to learn the identity mapping on a Gaussian mixture with structurally organized centroids. We mathematically analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks trained on this SIM task and show that, despite its simplicity, SIM's learning dynamics capture and help explain key empirical observations on compositional generalization with diffusion models identified in prior work. Our theory also offers several new insights -- e.g., we find a novel mechanism for non-monotonic learning dynamics of test loss in early phases of training. We validate our new predictions by training a text-conditioned diffusion model, bridging our simplified framework and complex generative models. Overall, this work establishes the SIM task as a meaningful theoretical abstraction of concept learning dynamics in modern generative models.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the remarkable ability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples provided in a user prompt without any model parameter updates. ICL was first observed in the domain of large language models, and it has been widely assumed that it is a product of the attention mechanism in autoregressive transformers. In this paper, using stylized regression learning tasks, we demonstrate that ICL can emerge in a non-autoregressive neural architecture with a hard-coded permutation-invariance inductive bias. This novel architecture, called DeepOSets, combines the set learning properties of the DeepSets architecture with the operator learning capabilities of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). We provide a representation theorem for permutation-invariant regression learning operators and prove that DeepOSets are universal approximators of this class of operators. We performed comprehensive numerical experiments to evaluate the capabilities of DeepOSets in learning linear, polynomial, and shallow neural network regression, under varying noise levels, dimensionalities, and sample sizes. In the high-dimensional regime, accuracy was enhanced by replacing the DeepSets layer with a Set Transformer. Our results show that DeepOSets deliver accurate and fast results with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than a comparable transformer-based alternative.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving computation enables language model inference directly on encrypted data yet suffers from prohibitive latency and communication overheads, primarily due to nonlinear functions. Removing nonlinearities, however, can trigger one of two failure modes restricting the potential for nonlinearity removal: entropy collapse in deeper layers, which destabilizes training, and entropic overload in early layers, causing under-utilization of attention heads. To address these challenges, we introduce AERO, an entropy-guided framework to strategically eliminates costly nonlinear operations from transformer architectures, which employs an adaptive recalibration through a head-wise entropy regularizer with learnable per-head strengths, enabling each head to adjust its entropy level while penalizing extreme entropies and fostering functional diversity through a tolerance margin. Experiments show AERO can save 3.4$\times$ communication and 1.4$\times$ latency, without any performance penalty.

Abstract: Predicting the behavior of a dynamical system from noisy observations of its past outputs is a classical problem encountered across engineering and science. For linear systems with Gaussian inputs, the Kalman filter -- the best linear minimum mean-square error estimator of the state trajectory -- is optimal in the Bayesian sense. For nonlinear systems, Bayesian filtering is typically approached using suboptimal heuristics such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), or numerical methods such as particle filtering (PF). In this work, we show that transformers, employed in an in-context learning (ICL) setting, can implicitly infer hidden states in order to predict the outputs of a wide family of dynamical systems, without test-time gradient updates or explicit knowledge of the system model. Specifically, when provided with a short context of past input-output pairs and, optionally, system parameters, a frozen transformer accurately predicts the current output. In linear-Gaussian regimes, its predictions closely match those of the Kalman filter; in nonlinear regimes, its performance approaches that of EKF and PF. Moreover, prediction accuracy degrades gracefully when key parameters, such as the state-transition matrix, are withheld from the context, demonstrating robustness and implicit parameter inference. These findings suggest that transformer in-context learning provides a flexible, non-parametric alternative for output prediction in dynamical systems, grounded in implicit latent-state estimation.

Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture, at once, dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies.

Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, legislation, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.

Abstract: The success of deep neural networks has driven numerous research studies and applications from Euclidean to non-Euclidean data. However, there are increasing concerns about privacy leakage, as these networks rely on processing private data. Recently, a new type of privacy attack, the model inversion attacks (MIAs), aims to extract sensitive features of private data for training by abusing access to a well-trained model. The effectiveness of MIAs has been demonstrated in various domains, including images, texts, and graphs. These attacks highlight the vulnerability of neural networks and raise awareness about the risk of privacy leakage within the research community. Despite the significance, there is a lack of systematic studies that provide a comprehensive overview and deeper insights into MIAs across different domains. This survey aims to summarize up-to-date MIA methods in both attacks and defenses, highlighting their contributions and limitations, underlying modeling principles, optimization challenges, and future directions. We hope this survey bridges the gap in the literature and facilitates future research in this critical area. Besides, we are maintaining a repository to keep track of relevant research at https://github.com/AndrewZhou924/Awesome-model-inversion-attack.

Abstract: The Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) is proposed to learn policies robust to dynamics shifts by adding regularization to the transition dynamics in the value function. Existing methods mostly use unstructured regularization, potentially leading to conservative policies under unrealistic transitions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear RRMDP ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces latent structures into both transition kernels and regularization. We focus on offline reinforcement learning, where an agent learns policies from a precollected dataset in the nominal environment. We develop the Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI) algorithm that employs linear function approximation for robust policy learning in $d$-RRMDPs with $f$-divergence based regularization terms on transition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the suboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, demonstrating that these bounds are influenced by how well the dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy under robustly admissible transitions. We establish information-theoretic lower bounds to verify that our algorithm is near-optimal. Finally, numerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to baseline methods.

<title>Resource-Adaptive Successive Doubling for Hyperparameter Optimization with Large Datasets on High-Performance Computing Systems</title>

Abstract: On High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, several hyperparameter configurations can be evaluated in parallel to speed up the Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) process. State-of-the-art HPO methods follow a bandit-based approach and build on top of successive halving, where the final performance of a combination is estimated based on a lower than fully trained fidelity performance metric and more promising combinations are assigned more resources over time. Frequently, the number of epochs is treated as a resource, letting more promising combinations train longer. Another option is to use the number of workers as a resource and directly allocate more workers to more promising configurations via data-parallel training. This article proposes a novel Resource-Adaptive Successive Doubling Algorithm (RASDA), which combines a resource-adaptive successive doubling scheme with the plain Asynchronous Successive Halving Algorithm (ASHA). Scalability of this approach is shown on up to 1,024 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on modern HPC systems. It is applied to different types of Neural Networks (NNs) and trained on large datasets from the Computer Vision (CV), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and Additive Manufacturing (AM) domains, where performing more than one full training run is usually infeasible. Empirical results show that RASDA outperforms ASHA by a factor of up to 1.9 with respect to the runtime. At the same time, the solution quality of final ASHA models is maintained or even surpassed by the implicit batch size scheduling of RASDA. With RASDA, systematic HPO is applied to a terabyte-scale scientific dataset for the first time in the literature, enabling efficient optimization of complex models on massive scientific data. The implementation of RASDA is available on https://github.com/olympiquemarcel/rasda

<title>Challenges learning from imbalanced data using tree-based models: Prevalence estimates systematically depend on hyperparameters and can be upwardly biased</title>

Abstract: When using machine learning for imbalanced binary classification problems, it is common to subsample the majority class to create a (more) balanced training dataset. This biases the model's predictions because the model learns from data whose data generating process differs from new data. One way of accounting for this bias is analytically mapping the resulting predictions to new values based on the sampling rate for the majority class. We show that calibrating a random forest this way has negative consequences, including prevalence estimates that depend on both the number of predictors considered at each split in the random forest and the sampling rate used. We explain the former using known properties of random forests and analytical calibration. Through investigating the latter issue, we made a surprising discovery - contrary to the widespread belief that decision trees are biased towards the majority class, they actually can be biased towards the minority class.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is essential for intelligent systems interacting with their environment, but existing language models often fall short in scenarios that require strategic information gathering. In this paper, we present Paprika, a fine-tuning approach that enables language models to develop general decision-making capabilities that are not confined to particular environments. By training on synthetic interaction data from different tasks that require diverse strategies, Paprika teaches models to explore and adapt their behavior on a new task based on environment feedback in-context without more gradient updates. Experimental results show that models fine-tuned with Paprika can effectively transfer their learned decision-making capabilities to entirely unseen tasks without additional training. Unlike traditional training, our approach's primary bottleneck lies in sampling useful interaction data instead of model updates. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes sampling trajectories from tasks with high learning potential. These results suggest a promising path towards AI systems that can autonomously solve novel sequential decision-making problems that require interactions with the external world.

<title>Fast Adversarial Training against Sparse Attacks Requires Loss Smoothing</title>

Abstract: This paper studies fast adversarial training against sparse adversarial perturbations bounded by $l_0$ norm. We demonstrate the challenges of employing $1$-step attacks on $l_0$ bounded perturbations for fast adversarial training, including degraded performance and the occurrence of catastrophic overfitting (CO). We highlight that CO in $l_0$ adversarial training is caused by sub-optimal perturbation locations of $1$-step attack. Theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that the loss landscape of $l_0$ adversarial training is more craggy compared to its $l_\infty$, $l_2$ and $l_1$ counterparts. Moreover, we corroborate that the craggy loss landscape can aggravate CO. To address these issues, we propose Fast-LS-$l_0$ that incorporates soft labels and the trade-off loss function to smooth the adversarial loss landscape. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method can overcome the challenge of catastrophic overfitting, achieve state-of-the-art performance, and narrow down the performance gap between $1$-step and multi-step adversarial training against sparse attacks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose BR-MTRL, a Byzantine-resilient multi-task representation learning framework that handles faulty or malicious agents. Our approach leverages representation learning through a shared neural network model, where all clients share fixed layers, except for a client-specific final layer. This structure captures shared features among clients while enabling individual adaptation, making it a promising approach for leveraging client data and computational power in heterogeneous federated settings to learn personalized models. To learn the model, we employ an alternating gradient descent strategy: each client optimizes its local model, updates its final layer, and sends estimates of the shared representation to a central server for aggregation. To defend against Byzantine agents, we employ two robust aggregation methods for client-server communication, Geometric Median and Krum. Our method enables personalized learning while maintaining resilience in distributed settings. We implemented the proposed algorithm in a federated testbed built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and compared its performance with various benchmark algorithms and their variations. Through experiments using real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST, we demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and its transferability to new unseen clients with limited data, even in the presence of Byzantine adversaries.

Abstract: Numerous applications of large language models (LLMs) rely on their ability to perform step-by-step reasoning. However, the reasoning behavior of LLMs remains poorly understood, posing challenges to research, development, and safety. To address this gap, we introduce landscape of thoughts (LoT), the first landscape visualization tool to inspect the reasoning trajectories with certain reasoning methods on any multi-choice dataset. We represent the textual states in a trajectory as numerical features that quantify the states' distances to the answer choices. These features are then visualized in two-dimensional plots using t-SNE. Qualitative and quantitative analysis with the landscape of thoughts effectively distinguishes between strong and weak models, correct and incorrect answers, as well as different reasoning tasks. It also uncovers undesirable reasoning patterns, such as low consistency and high uncertainty. Additionally, users can adapt LoT to a model that predicts the property they observe. We showcase this advantage by adapting LoT to a lightweight verifier that evaluates the correctness of trajectories. Empirically, this verifier boosts the reasoning accuracy and the test-time scaling effect. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/landscape-of-thoughts.

Abstract: Efficient on-device neural network (NN) inference offers predictable latency, improved privacy and reliability, and lower operating costs for vendors than cloud-based inference. This has sparked recent development of microcontroller-scale NN accelerators, also known as neural processing units ($\mu$NPUs), designed specifically for ultra-low-power applications. We present the first comparative evaluation of a number of commercially-available $\mu$NPUs, including the first independent benchmarks for multiple platforms. To ensure fairness, we develop and open-source a model compilation pipeline supporting consistent benchmarking of quantized models across diverse microcontroller hardware. Our resulting analysis uncovers both expected performance trends as well as surprising disparities between hardware specifications and actual performance, including certain $\mu$NPUs exhibiting unexpected scaling behaviors with model complexity. This work provides a foundation for ongoing evaluation of $\mu$NPU platforms, alongside offering practical insights for both hardware and software developers in this rapidly evolving space.

Abstract: Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has become a widely used technique for improving inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, existing PTQ methods generally suffer from crucial limitations such as heavy calibration data requirements and inflexible choice of target number of bits. In this paper, we propose RaanA, a unified PTQ framework that overcomes these challenges by introducing two novel components: 1) RaBitQ-H, a variant of a randomized vector quantization method RaBitQ, designed for fast, accurate, and highly efficient quantization; and 2) AllocateBits, an algorithm that optimally allocates bit-widths across layers based on their quantization sensitivity. RaanA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art quantization methods while being extremely fast, requiring minimal calibration data, and enabling flexible bit allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RaanA's efficacy in balancing efficiency and accuracy. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FFTYYY/RaanA .

Abstract: Existing machine unlearning (MU) approaches exhibit significant sensitivity to hyperparameters, requiring meticulous tuning that limits practical deployment. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the instability and suboptimal performance of existing popular MU methods when deployed in different scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Dual Optimizer (DualOptim), which incorporates adaptive learning rate and decoupled momentum factors. Empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrates that DualOptim contributes to effective and stable unlearning. Through extensive experiments, we show that DualOptim can significantly boost MU efficacy and stability across diverse tasks, including image classification, image generation, and large language models, making it a versatile approach to empower existing MU algorithms.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are heavily based on the availability of training data, which, depending on the domain, often includes sensitive information about data providers. This raises critical privacy concerns. Anonymization techniques have emerged as a practical solution to address these issues by generalizing features or suppressing data to make it more difficult to accurately identify individuals. Although recent studies have shown that privacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different subgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of anonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and $t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness, evaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals that anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to fourfold. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to improve under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input homogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse privacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights into the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable guidelines for responsible AI development.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures deeply enhanced long-context language modeling. Among them, HyperAttention achieves competitive efficiency by combining a single-level LSH-based clustering with uniform residual sampling. However, HyperAttention fails to find all significant keys, which in turn raises the overall perplexity. We propose a pre-scoring mechanism that prioritizes significant keys before applying HyperAttention. We introduce three scoring methods: $k$-means and kernel $k$-means clustering, $k$-median clustering, and leverage score-based ranking (inspired by LevAttention) to filter keys effectively. We further replace HyperAttention's original uniform residual sampling, relying exclusively on our pre-scoring mechanism. Experiments on ChatGLM2 (131k token context) reduce perplexity from 12 to 8.3, which outperforms standard HyperAttention. Moreover, when running on the Vision-Transformer (ViT), our method shows that it can guarantee similar accuracy compared with LevAttention, and will surpass LevAttention given specific parameters. Although this method introduces some computational overhead, its combination with HyperAttention achieves up to 20 times faster than FlashAttention, providing a balanced trade-off between speed and modeling accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating pre-scoring into hierarchical attention mechanisms, significantly improving transformer efficiency.

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

<title>Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $\mu$P</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including U-ViT, DiT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: We introduce GAIA (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence for Atmospheres), a hybrid self-supervised geospatial foundation model that fuses Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with self-distillation with no labels (DINO) to generate semantically rich representations from global geostationary satellite imagery. Pre-trained on 15 years of globally-merged infrared observations (2001-2015), GAIA learns disentangled representations that capture atmospheric dynamics rather than trivial diurnal patterns, as evidenced by distributed principal component structure and temporal coherence analysis. We demonstrate robust reconstruction capabilities across varying data availability (30-95% masking), achieving superior gap-filling performance on real missing data patterns. When transferred to downstream tasks, GAIA consistently outperforms an MAE-only baseline: improving atmospheric river segmentation (F1: 0.58 vs 0.52), enhancing tropical cyclone detection (storm-level recall: 81% vs 75%, early detection: 29% vs 17%), and maintaining competitive precipitation estimation performance. Analysis reveals that GAIA's hybrid objectives encourage learning of spatially coherent, object-centric features distributed across multiple principal components rather than concentrated representations focused on reconstruction. This work demonstrates that combining complementary self-supervised objectives yields more transferable representations for diverse atmospheric modeling tasks. Model weights and code are available at: https://huggingface.co/bcg-usra-nasa-gaia/GAIA-v1.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

Abstract: Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models (LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified in this work, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LVM-based forecaster poses an inductive bias towards "forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal decomposition and a novel backcast-residual based adaptive decomposition to integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 SOTA models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE) on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.

Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace, degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.

Abstract: We propose a framework for hypothesis testing on conditional probability distributions, which we then use to construct statistical tests of functionals of conditional distributions. These tests identify the inputs where the functionals differ with high probability, and include tests of conditional moments or two-sample tests. Our key idea is to transform confidence bounds of a learning method into a test of conditional expectations. We instantiate this principle for kernel ridge regression (KRR) with subgaussian noise. An intermediate data embedding then enables more general tests -- including conditional two-sample tests -- via kernel mean embeddings of distributions. To have guarantees in this setting, we generalize existing pointwise-in-time or time-uniform confidence bounds for KRR to previously-inaccessible yet essential cases such as infinite-dimensional outputs with non-trace-class kernels. These bounds also circumvent the need for independent data, allowing for instance online sampling. To make our tests readily applicable in practice, we introduce bootstrapping schemes leveraging the parametric form of testing thresholds identified in theory to avoid tuning inaccessible parameters. We illustrate the tests on examples, including one in process monitoring and comparison of dynamical systems. Overall, our results establish a comprehensive foundation for conditional testing on functionals, from theoretical guarantees to an algorithmic implementation, and advance the state of the art on confidence bounds for vector-valued least squares estimation.

Abstract: Healthcare providers often divide patient populations into cohorts based on shared clinical factors, such as medical history, to deliver personalized healthcare services. This idea has also been adopted in clinical prediction models, where it presents a vital challenge: capturing both global and cohort-specific patterns while enabling model generalization to unseen domains. Addressing this challenge falls under the scope of domain generalization (DG). However, conventional DG approaches often struggle in clinical settings due to the absence of explicit domain labels and the inherent gap in medical knowledge. To address this, we propose UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided method that iteratively divides patients into latent domains and decomposes domain-invariant (label) information from patient data. Our method identifies patient domains by pruning medical ontologies (e.g. ICD-9-CM hierarchy). On two public datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, UdonCare shows superiority over eight baselines across four clinical prediction tasks with substantial domain gaps, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge in guiding clinical domain generalization problems.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC), which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising 706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and 16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications, respectively. The code, data and models are available at https://github.com/JocelynSong/PPDiff.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve top performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms) during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design, where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD, dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem. Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal; and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into expressive representations. These representations are then combined with encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration, assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline models.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive success in control tasks. However, its policies, represented as opaque neural networks, are often difficult for humans to understand, verify, and debug, which undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for programmatic control policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as programmatic policy generators, combining them with evolutionary search to automate policy generation. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and guide targeted improvements, thereby enhancing policy discovery efficiency and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results demonstrate that MLES achieves performance comparable to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two standard control tasks while providing transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This approach also overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various tasks, showing promise as a new paradigm for developing transparent and verifiable control policies.

Abstract: Khiops is an open source machine learning tool designed for mining large multi-table databases. Khiops is based on a unique Bayesian approach that has attracted academic interest with more than 20 publications on topics such as variable selection, classification, decision trees and co-clustering. It provides a predictive measure of variable importance using discretisation models for numerical data and value clustering for categorical data. The proposed classification/regression model is a naive Bayesian classifier incorporating variable selection and weight learning. In the case of multi-table databases, it provides propositionalisation by automatically constructing aggregates. Khiops is adapted to the analysis of large databases with millions of individuals, tens of thousands of variables and hundreds of millions of records in secondary tables. It is available on many environments, both from a Python library and via a user interface.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous, uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at https://github.com/YujieZhu7/SPReD.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers. Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to their theoretical and empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of $\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of other stochastic processes.

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female, while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most effective techniques (performing best in all settings) are based on prefill attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when generating a completion from a predefined prefix. Our white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) also consistently increase the success rate of the LLM auditor, but are less effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained, interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning tasks.

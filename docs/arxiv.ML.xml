<div> zero-shot learning, generative, few-shot, attribute scoring, semantic regularization

Summary: 
FSIGenZ proposes a generative zero-shot learning framework inspired by few-shot learning, aiming to reduce reliance on large-scale feature synthesis. The method introduces Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS) to dynamically re-score class attributes based on model-specific optimization. By estimating group-level prototypes as clusters of instances and using Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) to address data imbalance, FSIGenZ generates representative synthetic features for unseen classes. These features are used to train a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC). Experimental results on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks show that FSIGenZ achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer synthetic features. <div>

Abstract: Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS), which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes. Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

<div> quantization, language models, DBellQuant, weight compression, activation quantization

Summary:
DBellQuant is a new post-training quantization framework that addresses challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in terms of computational and memory constraints. It achieves nearly 1-bit weight compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance degradation through the use of the Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB) algorithm. This innovative approach transforms weight distributions into dual-bell forms to reduce quantization errors and smooths activations using inverse transformations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization. For instance, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant outperforms BiLLM in terms of perplexity, achieving 14.39 with 6-bit activation quantization compared to BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization. This demonstrates the potential of DBellQuant for compressing LLMs for real-world applications.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB) algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization. For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of 14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

<div> non-contrastive, self-supervised learning, stop gradient, exponential moving average, representation collapse
Summary:
In non-contrastive self-supervised learning, the objective is to minimize the mean discrepancy between predicted codes from two different data views. The use of stop gradient and exponential moving average procedures helps prevent representation collapse, leading to strong performance in supervised tasks. While these procedures may not optimize the original objective function, they effectively avoid collapse. In linear cases, failure to use these procedures can result in collapse. However, the dynamical systems associated with stop gradient and exponential moving average converge to stable equilibria, ensuring they do not degenerate into trivial solutions.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors, leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical representation. The practical implementation of FGM requires a significant allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar FGM utilizing machine learning algorithms for application in combustion simulations of methane fuel. This study employs four Machine Learning algorithms to regenerate Flamelet libraries, based on an understanding of data sources, techniques, and data-driven concepts. 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron; 2. Random Forest; 3. Linear Regression; 4. Support Vector Machine. Seven libraries were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden layers and neurons significantly influences method performance. The optimal model, comprising four hidden layers with 10, 15, 20, and 25 neurons respectively, achieved an accuracy of 99.81%.

Abstract: Geometric learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling non-Euclidean data, especially graph-structured ones, with applications spanning social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While Nvidia's CUDA-enabled graphics processing units (GPUs) largely dominate the hardware landscape, emerging accelerators such as Intel's Gaudi Habana Processing Units (HPUs) offer competitive performance and energy efficiency. However, the usage of such non-CUDA processing units requires significant engineering effort and novel software adaptations. In this work, we present our experiences porting PyTorch-based geometric learning frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and detailed workarounds. We collect all our experiences into a publicly accessible GitHub repository. Our contributions lower the barrier for researchers to experiment with geometric-learning algorithms and models on non-CUDA hardware, providing a foundation for further optimization and cross-platform portability.

Summary:<br>
- Proposed uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics data classification
- Utilized refined activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution parameters
- Employed fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous omics modalities
- Dynamic decision mechanism incrementally introduces omics data for each patient until a confidence threshold is reached
- Evaluation on four benchmark datasets showed accurate classification with single omics modalities, reducing redundant testing while maintaining diagnostic performance. <div>
arXiv:2507.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN. In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and preserves essential biological insights.

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding, generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

Summary: 
The study focuses on optimizing hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommender systems (ReS) to improve inference latency and training efficiency. By integrating various optimization strategies such as quantization, LoRA, and distillation, along with hardware accelerators like FPGA and DeepSpeed, significant improvements were achieved. The optimal configuration of Hybrid + FPGA + DeepSpeed showed a 13.6% increase in accuracy with a latency of 40-60ms, while LoRA reduced training time by 66% compared to the baseline. The research highlights the importance of hardware-software co-design and parameter tuning for hybrid models to outperform standalone GNN or LLM approaches. Recommendations include using FPGA and LoRA for real-time deployment, with future work suggested to explore federated learning and advanced fusion architectures for scalability and privacy preservation. This study sets the groundwork for next-generation recommender systems that balance low-latency response with personalized recommendations.

Abstract: The incessant advent of online services demands high speed and efficient recommender systems (ReS) that can maintain real-time performance along with processing very complex user-item interactions. The present study, therefore, considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used: hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization, LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2. Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA + DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge personalization.

Summary: <br>
In this work, the authors introduce a new technique called First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) to speed up iterative solvers for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) by preserving stable solution segments and focusing only on unstable portions. They also propose Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), a neural framework that helps identify which segments should be aggregated by FSTA. Three L2Seg variants are presented, showcasing significant acceleration of state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up to 7x on CVRP and VRPTW problems. The study reveals that a combination of non-autoregressive and autoregressive approaches in L2Seg yields the best performance. L2Seg is shown to be flexible and compatible with various types of solvers, supporting a wide range of VRPs. Additionally, empirical analysis highlights the synergy between the different variants of L2Seg in enhancing the overall performance of iterative solvers. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants: non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate), autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy, with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably, L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional, learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1 environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000 updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in reinforcement learning tasks.

Summary: <br>
This paper introduces a fast DAG-based model splitting algorithm for efficient artificial intelligence model training. By representing AI models as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the optimal model splitting problem is reformulated as a minimum s-t cut search problem. The proposed algorithm restructures the DAG to enable optimal model splitting identification using a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis confirms its optimality.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper, we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by 24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained. The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets, demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility. Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the method's robustness and adaptability.

Summary: The study introduces a cardiac sensing foundation model (CSFM) that utilizes transformer architectures and generative pretraining to learn unified representations from heterogeneous health records. The model is pretrained on a multimodal integration of data from various large-scale datasets, including cardiac signals and clinical or machine-generated text reports from around 1.7 million individuals. Results show that CSFM serves as effective feature extractors for diverse cardiac sensing scenarios and enables transfer learning across different input configurations and sensor modalities. CSFM outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches across diagnostic tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical outcome prediction, and ECG question answering. The model demonstrates robust performance in scenarios with varying ECG lead configurations, sensor modalities, and signal availability, highlighting its potential as a versatile and scalable solution for comprehensive cardiac monitoring. <div>

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms (PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models, limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7 million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard 12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive cardiac monitoring.

<div> variational digital twin, Bayesian output layer, real-time implementation, model uncertainty, energy assets <br>
Summary: 
The paper introduces a variational digital twin (VDT) framework that incorporates a Bayesian output layer into neural architectures to provide real-time insights into energy assets with calibrated uncertainty bounds. The VDT updates quickly on commodity GPUs and enhances experiment design, control algorithms, and model reliability. Key features include uncertainty-driven active learning, maintaining high accuracy for renewable generation with monthly updates, robustness to sensor loss in a nuclear reactor twin, and improved Li-ion battery voltage prediction. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the VDT in creating uncertainty-aware, data-efficient, and computationally tractable digital twins for industrial and scientific energy systems. <div>

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design, control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient, and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across industrial and scientific energy systems.

Summary: 
The research paper addresses the issue of toxic content on social media platforms, emphasizing the need for effective detoxification methods that remove toxicity while preserving the original meaning of the text. Existing approaches often struggle to balance detoxification performance, semantic preservation, and robustness to different types of data. The proposed two-stage training framework focuses on optimizing data efficiency, semantic preservation, and model generalization. The first stage involves supervised fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data, followed by training the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization with unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom reward model. Experimental results show that the method outperforms previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved generalization and reduced reliance on annotated data. The code for the proposed method is also available for further experimentation and validation.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

Summary: 
The study introduces a new energy functional for long-sequence memory based on dense Hopfield networks. By incorporating a temporal kernel $K(m, k)$ to capture temporal dependencies, the model enables efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. It showcases successful application in storing and retrieving movie frames due to the high-dimensional vectors representing each frame. The technique offers advancements for modern transformer architectures by enhancing long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improving attention with temporal bias, and handling long-term dependencies in time-series data. This approach shows promise in overcoming transformer limitations in tasks requiring long-context contexts, potentially benefiting applications in natural language processing, forecasting, and beyond.

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language processing, forecasting, and beyond.

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.

Summary: 
Flooding events have a significant impact on pavement infrastructure, leading to increased pavement roughness as measured by the International Roughness Index (IRI). Using 20 years of pavement condition data integrated with flood event information, the study compared IRI values before and after flooding to calculate deterioration rates. The analysis revealed that flood-affected pavements experienced a faster increase in roughness compared to non-flooded sections. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), were employed to assess the impact of flooding on pavement performance. The research highlights the importance of implementing proactive flood mitigation strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index (IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data, including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g., from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices. We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause with less than 6% value errors.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability, while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3) rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance. Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery and material design.

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge. Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing, and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks run also through workflow management systems.

Summary: 
Anomaly detection in Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication systems is challenging due to the lack of tailored models and inconsistent ground truth data. This study introduces a novel approach using a decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in ECU communication logs by identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. By incorporating an entropy regularization technique, the model increases uncertainty in known anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. The decoder-only architecture, handling of inconsistent labeling, and adaptable LLM for various ECU communication use cases are key innovations. The approach leverages the generative abilities of decoder-only models to reduce the cost and errors associated with manual labeling, enabling the system to learn from minimal examples and enhance detection accuracy in complex communication environments. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection accuracy in complex communication environments.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest due to their flexibility and generalization capabilities. However, the lack of transparency in their development process, including determining hyperparameters like the number of epochs, poses challenges in identifying the best model. To address this issue, machine learning frameworks like MLFlow can automate data collection, but they lack robust lineage tracking. This paper introduces yProv4ML, a framework that captures provenance information in PROV-JSON format with minimal code modifications. By utilizing yProv4ML, researchers can track the process of machine learning model development and have a more transparent understanding of the decisions made throughout the process. <div>

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage. This paper proposes yProv4ML, a framework to capture provenance information generated during machine learning processes in PROV-JSON format, with minimal code modifications.

Summary: <br>
This study compares the performance of three AI models (NLP, LLM, JEPA) in predicting triage outcomes against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice in an emergency department setting. The LLM model (URGENTIAPARSE) demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting triage levels, outperforming nurse triage. Secondary analyses showed its effectiveness in predicting hospitalization needs and its robustness with structured data. The findings suggest that LLM architecture offers the most accurate triage predictions among the tested models. Integrating AI into emergency department workflows could improve patient safety and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France). Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2) URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.

Summary:
The article delves into the proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN) by Ziyin et al. The study reveals that through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training, EDLNs with varying widths and depths, when trained on diverse data, converge to Perfectly Platonic solutions. This phenomenon is remarkable given that SGD typically locates non-Platonic global minima. The research identifies six potential ways in which the PRH can be broken. Furthermore, it establishes a link between Platonic representations and progressive sharpening in the EDLN model, suggesting a shared underlying cause for these apparently distinct phenomena in deep learning. The study underscores the significance of comprehending emergent entropic forces arising from the irreversible nature of SGD training and their impact on representation learning.<br><br>Summary: The article elucidates the perfect Platonic representations achieved in EDLNs via SGD training, showcasing the convergence towards common solutions despite varied network characteristics and data inputs. It also outlines potential vulnerabilities in the PRH and reveals a connection between Platonic representations and progressive sharpening, attributing their emergence to entropic forces during training. <div>

Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD, two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid lengthy technical details.

Summary: 
The paper explores the impact of spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private training on the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and Adam. Contrary to common intuition, the study finds that aiming for unbiased estimates of second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers may not be the best approach. Instead, a technique called scale-then-privatize, which does not achieve unbiased second moments, shows more promising theoretical behaviors and outperforms other variants on a small-scale language model training task. The study also argues that scale-then-privatize aligns noise addition with correlated noise mechanisms, which are more practical for real-world applications. The findings challenge existing beliefs and provide new insights into improving the performance of adaptive optimizers in differentially private training settings. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.01129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP) training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which are more desirable to use in practice.

Summary:
Tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) are proposed as a way to accelerate the computation of SO(3)-equivariant networks used in machine learning interatomic potentials. By replacing the costly Clebsch-Gordan tensor product with low-rank tensor decompositions like the CP decomposition, TDNs maintain accuracy while reducing computational complexity from O(L^6) to O(L^4). Additionally, path-weight sharing ties multiplicity-space weights to a single path, further reducing parameters without compromising equivariance. The research proves a uniform error bound on equivariance and the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map with the CP decomposition. Evaluation on molecular relaxation datasets demonstrates the competitive performance and significant speedup achieved by TDNs compared to existing methods. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive performance with dramatic speedup in computations.

In scientific domains, where imbalanced learning settings are common, SMH aims to generate synthetic graph samples that maintain topological properties while focusing on underrepresented target distribution regions.

In this paper, we present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

Summary:
FlashDP is introduced as a new method for training large language models (LLMs) while protecting the privacy of training data through Differential Privacy (DP). It improves on existing methods by consolidating necessary operations into a single task, reducing memory movement by up to 50% and cutting down redundant computations by 20%. FlashDP achieves a 90% throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system during pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining accuracy parity with standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD. This innovative approach is efficient and privacy-preserving, making it a significant development for the training of LLMs. The code for FlashDP has been open-sourced, enabling further research and implementation in this area.

<br><br>Summary: FlashDP is a new method that enhances the privacy-preserving training of large language models by consolidating operations, reducing memory movement and redundant computations.

arXiv:2507.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern. Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data, yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus, necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods. Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a \textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp.

Large Brainwave Foundation Models were found to offer only marginal improvements over traditional architectures in BCI tasks while requiring significantly more parameters. Ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) were utilized to reduce parameters without performance loss, revealing inefficiencies in LBMs. Optimal training strategies for BCI applications, including full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation, were considered. LoRA was applied to LBMs, indicating performance benefits from adapting multiple network components simultaneously.

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.

Summary:
The article explores the idea of aligning vision and language models towards a shared statistical model of reality through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. The Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework is introduced to optimize for alignment between disjoint representations by training modality-specific autoencoders on pre-trained single modality models, aiming to preserve each modality's native structure while encouraging mutual coherence. The study evaluates different alignment objectives, layer depths, and foundation model scales to induce alignment effectively across frozen, independently trained representations. The findings show that the lightweight JAM framework, utilizing spread loss as an alignment objective, successfully induces alignment and offers insights for transforming unimodal foundations into multimodal models.

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.

Summary:
Modern vehicles rely heavily on connected technology, such as automotive Ethernet, for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are vulnerable to attacks, including flow injection attacks, which can pose a serious safety risk. To address this issue, Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are commonly employed, but they often require costly hardware for real-time operation. In this study, the researchers propose utilizing fast neural network inference techniques like Distilling and Pruning to deploy IDS models on low-cost platforms for real-time intrusion detection. The results demonstrate that these techniques can achieve intrusion detection times as fast as 727 μs on a Raspberry Pi 4, with high AUCROC values of 0.9890. This approach offers a cost-effective solution for enhancing the security of automotive Ethernet systems in connected vehicles.

Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection attacks. Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often designed to combat this problem, but they require expensive hardware to run in real time. In this work, we propose to evaluate and apply fast neural network inference techniques like Distilling and Prunning for deploying IDS models on low-cost platforms in real time. The results show that these techniques can achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4, with AUCROC values of 0.9890.

<div> Keywords: LLM fine-tuning, mobile device, privacy-aware, efficient, server-assisted<br>
Summary:<br>
There is a significant challenge in deploying large language model fine-tuning on mobile devices due to resource constraints. To address this issue, the PAE MobiLLM method is introduced, which focuses on both privacy awareness and efficiency. By utilizing server-assisted additive side-tuning, PAE MobiLLM allows for on-device fine-tuning without compromising data security. Activation caching on the server side helps to improve convergence speed and reduce computational load on the mobile device. Communication costs are minimized through the use of a one-token activation shortcut, which transmits only essential information for model tuning. Additionally, the additive adapter side-network design ensures that the server only assists in computing device-defined parameters, maintaining data privacy. PAE MobiLLM represents a novel approach to enabling fine-tuning of large language models on mobile devices while addressing privacy concerns and optimizing resource utilization. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

The study introduces the PULSE protocol to evaluate unlearning in large multimodal models (LMMs). It considers pre-trained knowledge unlearning and long-term sustainability evaluation. Existing unlearning methods struggle to eliminate pre-training knowledge and exhibit degradation when unlearning data sequentially.

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Graph federated recommendation systems provide a privacy-preserving alternative to centralized recommendation architectures by utilizing federated learning to generate personalized recommendations without exposing raw user data.

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed, traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover, evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings, while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing federated learning frameworks.

Summary: 
The paper presents a framework for solving high-dimensional stochastic control problems using deep learning, introducing the concept of a Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO). NHO parameterizes the dynamics of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations using neural networks to represent feedback control and the value function's spatial gradient. The optimal NHO is found through training the networks to satisfy the conditions of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. By viewing the deep FBSDE method from an operator-theoretic standpoint, the paper frames it as a statistical inference problem of learning an unknown operator from data. The universal approximation capabilities of NHOs are proven, and the optimization challenges specific to these models are analyzed within this framework. <div>

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization challenges inherent to this class of models.

Summary:
The paper introduces the concept of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) and explores its vulnerability to backdoor attacks. It proposes the dual-learning hypothesis, suggesting that LLMs concurrently learn task-relevant and backdoor latent concepts, influencing model outputs. An upper bound for ICL backdoor effects is derived, showing vulnerability is influenced by concept preference ratios. The ICLShield defense mechanism is proposed to adjust concept preference ratios dynamically, encouraging selection of clean demonstrations during the ICL phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICLShield's effectiveness in mitigating backdoor attacks, outperforming existing approaches by 26.02% on average. The method shows adaptability and defensive performance even for closed-source models such as GPT-4.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature. However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects, revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness, attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models, contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable hydrological forecasts.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance. Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

arXiv:2507.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much earlier.
  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism, which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a "Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.
  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs second-task-token performance.

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e., Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential research directions.

<title>Zero-Incentive Dynamics: a look at reward sparsity through the lens of unrewarded subgoals</title>

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate incentives.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning can play a key role in addressing sustainable energy challenges. For instance, many grid systems are heavily congested, highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However, reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines. Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over 100x-1000x over existing environments. Additionally, Chargax' modular architecture enables the representation of diverse real-world charging station configurations.

Abstract: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision, audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model, achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or requiring any domain-specific training. We open source our code and datasets at https://github.com/penfever/marvis

<title>Self-Guided Process Reward Optimization with Masked Step Advantage for Process Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward \textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and \textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately $1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking. Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial implementation.

<title>How Weight Resampling and Optimizers Shape the Dynamics of Continual Learning and Forgetting in Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns sequentially at transfer time.

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server reliability issues. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy, bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor localization systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Muon, a new optimizer that leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters. We provide convergence proofs for four practical variants of Muon: with and without Nesterov momentum, and with and without weight decay. We then show that adding weight decay leads to strictly tighter bounds on both the parameter and gradient norms, and we clarify the relationship between the weight decay coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive Muon's critical batch size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is the stochastic computational cost, and validate our theoretical findings with experiments.

Abstract: We propose an efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based sparse representations. In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low computational complexity. Experiments on four datasets across different domains show that our method not only outperforms existing online kernel dictionary learning approaches but also achieves classification accuracy close to that of batch-trained models, while remaining significantly more efficient.

Abstract: \textit{Dance Dance Revolution} is a rhythm game consisting of songs and accompanying choreography, referred to as charts. Players press arrows on a device referred to as a dance pad in time with steps determined by the song's chart. In 2017, the authors of Dance Dance Convolution (DDC) developed an algorithm for the automatic generation of \textit{Dance Dance Revolution} charts, utilizing a CNN-LSTM architecture. We introduce Dance Dance ConvLSTM (DDCL), a new method for the automatic generation of DDR charts using a ConvLSTM based model, which improves upon the DDC methodology and substantially increases the accuracy of chart generation.

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization, editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

<title>AsyncFlow: An Asynchronous Streaming RL Framework for Efficient LLM Post-Training</title>

arXiv:2507.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges, we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces, offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

<title>Blending Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Prefix Sampling</title>

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15539879.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus, carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.
  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.
  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Abstract: Estimation of model uncertainty can help improve the explainability of Graph Convolutional Networks and the accuracy of the models at the same time. Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks. We estimate uncertainty in both outputs and layer-wise attentions of the models, which has the potential for improving model explainability. We showcase the benefits of these models in the social trading analysis and the skeleton-based human action recognition tasks on the Finnish board membership, NTU-60, NTU-120 and Kinetics datasets, where we show improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets. To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Abstract: Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined. Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii) vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the computational domain.
  In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

Abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization, fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings. This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

<title>Tuning without Peeking: Provable Privacy and Generalization Bounds for LLM Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization.

<title>Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage</title>

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

Abstract: We introduce BranchNet, a neuro-symbolic learning framework that transforms decision tree ensembles into sparse, partially connected neural networks. Each branch, defined as a decision path from root to a parent of leaves, is mapped to a hidden neuron, preserving symbolic structure while enabling gradient-based optimization. The resulting models are compact, interpretable, and require no manual architecture tuning. Evaluated on a suite of structured multi-class classification benchmarks, BranchNet consistently outperforms XGBoost in accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture, training procedure, and sparsity dynamics, and discuss the model's strengths in symbolic interpretability as well as its current limitations, particularly on binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning designed specifically for users with limited computational resources, particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to knowledge transfer in model-based reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of deploying large world models in resource-constrained environments. Our method efficiently distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact model (1M parameters) on the MT30 benchmark, significantly improving performance across diverse tasks. Our distilled model achieves a state-of-the-art normalized score of 28.45, surpassing the original 1M parameter model score of 18.93. This improvement demonstrates the ability of our distillation technique to capture and consolidate complex multi-task knowledge. We further optimize the distilled model through FP16 post-training quantization, reducing its size by $\sim$50\%. Our approach addresses practical deployment limitations and offers insights into knowledge representation in large world models, paving the way for more efficient and accessible multi-task reinforcement learning systems in robotics and other resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results, demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae, the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves promising results.

<title>mGRADE: Minimal Recurrent Gating Meets Delay Convolutions for Lightweight Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short- and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU). This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal processing at the edge.

<title>Out-of-Distribution Detection Methods Answer the Wrong Questions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2507.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment, since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective. Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their own fundamental limitations.

<title>Automatic Rank Determination for Low-Rank Adaptation via Submodular Function Maximization</title>

arXiv:2507.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized) approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting, alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection, they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model (SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/CRISP\_SAM2.git.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities to jailbreaking attacks: carefully crafted malicious inputs intended to circumvent safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. As such, we present AutoAdv, a novel framework that automates adversarial prompt generation to systematically evaluate and expose vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms. Our approach leverages a parametric attacker LLM to produce semantically disguised malicious prompts through strategic rewriting techniques, specialized system prompts, and optimized hyperparameter configurations. The primary contribution of our work is a dynamic, multi-turn attack methodology that analyzes failed jailbreak attempts and iteratively generates refined follow-up prompts, leveraging techniques such as roleplaying, misdirection, and contextual manipulation. We quantitatively evaluate attack success rate (ASR) using the StrongREJECT (arXiv:2402.10260 [cs.CL]) framework across sequential interaction turns. Through extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models--including ChatGPT, Llama, and DeepSeek--we reveal significant vulnerabilities, with our automated attacks achieving jailbreak success rates of up to 86% for harmful content generation. Our findings reveal that current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to sophisticated multi-turn attacks, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.

Abstract: This study presents an exploratory evaluation of Music Generation Systems (MGS) within contemporary music production workflows by examining eight open-source systems. The evaluation framework combines technical insights with practical experimentation through criteria specifically designed to investigate the practical and creative affordances of the systems within the iterative, non-linear nature of music production. Employing a single-evaluator methodology as a preliminary phase, this research adopts a mixed approach utilizing qualitative methods to form hypotheses subsequently assessed through quantitative metrics. The selected systems represent architectural diversity across both symbolic and audio-based music generation approaches, spanning composition, arrangement, and sound design tasks. The investigation addresses limitations of current MGS in music production, challenges and opportunities for workflow integration, and development potential as collaborative tools while maintaining artistic authenticity. Findings reveal these systems function primarily as complementary tools enhancing rather than replacing human expertise. They exhibit limitations in maintaining thematic and structural coherence that emphasize the indispensable role of human creativity in tasks demanding emotional depth and complex decision-making. This study contributes a structured evaluation framework that considers the iterative nature of music creation. It identifies methodological refinements necessary for subsequent comprehensive evaluations and determines viable areas for AI integration as collaborative tools in creative workflows. The research provides empirically-grounded insights to guide future development in the field.

Abstract: Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising direction to channel coding for 6G networks.

Abstract: The judiciary, as one of democracy's three pillars, is dealing with a rising amount of legal issues, needing careful use of judicial resources. This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize conversational strategies for product recommendation across diverse industries. As organizations increasingly adopt intelligent agents to support sales and service operations, the effectiveness of a conversation hinges not only on what is recommended but how and when recommendations are delivered. We explore a methodology where agentic systems learn optimal dialogue policies through feedback-driven reinforcement learning. By mining aggregate behavioral patterns and conversion outcomes, our approach enables agents to refine talk tracks that drive higher engagement and product uptake, while adhering to contextual and regulatory constraints. We outline the conceptual framework, highlight key innovations, and discuss the implications for scalable, personalized recommendation in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.

Abstract: Landslides pose severe threats to infrastructure, economies, and human lives, necessitating accurate detection and predictive mapping across diverse geographic regions. With advancements in deep learning and remote sensing, automated landslide detection has become increasingly effective. This study presents a comprehensive approach integrating multi-source satellite imagery and deep learning models to enhance landslide identification and prediction. We leverage Sentinel-2 multispectral data and ALOS PALSAR-derived slope and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layers to capture critical environmental features influencing landslide occurrences. Various geospatial analysis techniques are employed to assess the impact of terra in characteristics, vegetation cover, and rainfall on detection accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of multiple stateof-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and Res-Net, to determine their effectiveness in landslide detection. The proposed framework contributes to the development of reliable early warning systems, improved disaster risk management, and sustainable land-use planning. Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential of deep learning and multi-source remote sensing in creating robust, scalable, and transferable landslide prediction models.

Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) adds a spatial dimension to auditory perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks (NNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored. Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to facilitate researchers in identifying relevant work for their specific contexts. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in SSL works in general, regarding environmental robustness, sound source multiplicity, and specific implementation constraints in robotics, as well as data and learning strategies in DL-based SSL. Also, we sketch promising directions to offer an actionable roadmap toward robust, adaptable, efficient, and explainable DL-based SSL for next-generation robots.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in enabling quadruped robots to perform agile locomotion. However, directly training policies to simultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and extreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due to unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address this, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving priors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple stages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors through iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER progressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration and policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or handcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured three-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation space, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust monopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the resulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional methods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly spaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm. JumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing locomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and extreme terrains.

Abstract: Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However, traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method. To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed, revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in open-source Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Llama have catalyzed extensive research on their integration with diverse systems. The internet-scale general knowledge encapsulated within these models presents significant opportunities for enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities. In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model, which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of the model. The enhanced VLM generates high-level navigational commands that VAD subsequently processes to guide vehicle operation. Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations of driving decisions, thereby increasing transparency and trustworthiness of the traditionally black-box end-to-end architecture. Comprehensive evaluation on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our integrated system reduces average collision rates by 31.82% compared to baseline methodologies, establishing a new benchmark for VLM-augmented autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model, Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple, the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format. Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes, an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.

Abstract: Vascular segmentation in medical images is crucial for disease diagnosis and surgical navigation. However, the segmented vascular structure is often discontinuous due to its slender nature and inadequate prior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Serpentine Window Mamba (SWinMamba) to achieve accurate vascular segmentation. The proposed SWinMamba innovatively models the continuity of slender vascular structures by incorporating serpentine window sequences into bidirectional state space models. The serpentine window sequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global visual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine Window Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping serpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for vascular structure modeling. The Bidirectional Aggregation Module (BAM) integrates coherent local features in the RFs for vascular continuity representation. In addition, dual-domain learning with Spatial-Frequency Fusion Unit (SFFU) is designed to enhance the feature representation of vascular structure. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed SWinMamba achieves superior performance with complete and connected vessels.

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation. The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher data quality.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning. Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format. Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units, which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators, weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps. Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture, which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance. Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as autonomous agents with rapidly expanding applications in various domains. As these agents increasingly engage in socioeconomic interactions, identifying their potential for undesirable behavior becomes essential. In this work, we examine scenarios where they can choose to collude, defined as secretive cooperation that harms another party. To systematically study this, we investigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated continuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments, we analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model, and presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of seller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive tendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental pressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence collusive behavior. Our findings highlight important economic and ethical considerations for the deployment of LLM-based market agents.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Grading handwritten, open-ended responses remains a major bottleneck in large university STEM courses. We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface.
  Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Our findings show that Pensieve reduces grading time by an average of 65%, while maintaining a 95.4% agreement rate with instructor-assigned grades for high-confidence predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their versatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining. Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings, processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recently, data-driven methods have shown great promise for discovering governing equations from simulation or experimental data. However, most existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models. It adapts to both compressible and incompressible flow conditions and successfully identifies the corresponding macroscopic forms, highlighting its potential for data-driven discovery of tensor equation.

<title>Optimizing Methane Detection On Board Satellites: Speed, Accuracy, and Low-Power Solutions for Resource-Constrained Hardware</title>

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile, many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively, onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE, CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet). Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data, and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from https://github.com/zaitra/methane-filters-benchmark.

Abstract: Ishai et al. (FOCS'06) introduced secure shuffling as an efficient building block for private data aggregation. Recently, the field of differential privacy has revived interest in secure shufflers by highlighting the privacy amplification they can provide in various computations. Although several works argue for the utility of secure shufflers, they often treat them as black boxes; overlooking the practical vulnerabilities and performance trade-offs of existing implementations. This leaves a central question open: what makes a good secure shuffler?
  This survey addresses that question by identifying, categorizing, and comparing 26 secure protocols that realize the necessary shuffling functionality. To enable a meaningful comparison, we adapt and unify existing security definitions into a consistent set of properties. We also present an overview of privacy-preserving technologies that rely on secure shufflers, offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate protocols, and outline promising directions for future work.

Abstract: Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters. This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score, Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39 meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies 30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further validation is needed to assess physical validity.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations, a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Abstract: This paper provides a proof of the consistency of sparse grid quadrature for numerical integration of high dimensional distributions. In a first step, a transport map is learned that normalizes the distribution to a noise distribution on the unit cube. This step is built on the statistical learning theory of neural ordinary differential equations, which has been established recently. Secondly, the composition of the generative map with the quantity of interest is integrated numerically using the Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grid quadrature. A decomposition of the total numerical error in quadrature error and statistical error is provided. As main result it is proven in the framework of empirical risk minimization that all error terms can be controlled in the sense of PAC (probably approximately correct) learning and with high probability the numerical integral approximates the theoretical value up to an arbitrary small error in the limit where the data set size is growing and the network capacity is increased adaptively.

Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are ubiquitous in statistical learning, particularly for unsupervised problems. While full GMMs suffer from the overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces, spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.

Abstract: Critical infrastructure, such as transport networks, underpins economic growth by enabling mobility and trade. However, ageing assets, climate change impacts (e.g., extreme weather, rising sea levels), and hybrid threats ranging from natural disasters to cyber attacks and conflicts pose growing risks to their resilience and functionality. This review paper explores how emerging digital technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), can enhance damage assessment and monitoring of transport infrastructure. A systematic literature review examines existing AI models and datasets for assessing damage in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by natural disasters. Special focus is given to the unique challenges and opportunities associated with bridge damage detection due to their structural complexity and critical role in connectivity. The integration of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data with AI models is also discussed, with the review revealing a critical research gap: a scarcity of studies applying AI models to SAR data for comprehensive bridge damage assessment. Therefore, this review aims to identify the research gaps and provide foundations for AI-driven solutions for assessing and monitoring critical transport infrastructures.

Abstract: Automation in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) plays a prominent role in alert classification and incident escalation. However, automated methods must be robust in the presence of imbalanced input data, which can negatively affect performance. Additionally, automated methods should make explainable decisions. In this work, we evaluate the effect of label imbalance on the classification of network intrusion alerts. As our use-case we employ DeepCASE, the state-of-the-art method for automated alert classification. We show that label imbalance impacts both classification performance and correctness of the classification explanations offered by DeepCASE. We conclude tuning the detection rules used in SOCs can significantly reduce imbalance and may benefit the performance and explainability offered by alert post-processing methods such as DeepCASE. Therefore, our findings suggest that traditional methods to improve the quality of input data can benefit automation.

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial in industrial environments. Visible Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering high accuracy, energy efficiency, and minimal electromagnetic interference. However, VLC-based indoor localization faces challenges due to environmental variability, such as lighting fluctuations and obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based indoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL framework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization accuracy by 47\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\%, and decrease computational time by 40\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is highly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar accuracy with only 30\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable option for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.

Abstract: Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning. Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.
  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning, and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools, orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent, data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges associated with designing data agent systems.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.

Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges. Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise in quality.

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning, drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage rather than an imposed limitation.

Abstract: The integration of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) techniques with uncertainty quantification (UQ) represents a rapidly evolving frontier in computational science. This work advances Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by incorporating probabilistic frameworks to effectively model uncertainty in complex systems. Our approach enhances the representation of uncertainty in forward problems by combining generative modeling techniques with PINNs. This integration enables in a systematic fashion uncertainty control while maintaining the predictive accuracy of the model. We demonstrate the utility of this method through applications to random differential equations and random partial differential equations (PDEs).

Abstract: In the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, we are given a set $X$ of data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a kernel function $k: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and a query point $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and the objective is to quickly output an estimate of $\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in X} k(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{x})$. In this paper, we consider $\textsf{KDE}$ in the dynamic setting, and introduce a data structure that efficiently maintains the estimates for a set of query points as data points are added to $X$ over time. Based on this, we design a dynamic data structure that maintains a sparse approximation of the fully connected similarity graph on $X$, and develop a fast dynamic spectral clustering algorithm. We further evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Patents contain rich technical knowledge that can inspire innovative product ideas, yet accessing and interpreting this information remains a challenge. This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work, we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.

Abstract: This letter proposes UniToCom, a unified token communication paradigm that treats tokens as the fundamental units for both processing and wireless transmission. Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this, GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling, maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for next-generation intelligent communications.

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g., an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g., "What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within complex multimodal environments.

Abstract: We propose a neural entropy-stable conservative flux form neural network (NESCFN) for learning hyperbolic conservation laws and their associated entropy functions directly from solution trajectories, without requiring any predefined numerical discretization. While recent neural network architectures have successfully integrated classical numerical principles into learned models, most rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations or assume a fixed discretization. Our approach removes this dependency by embedding entropy-stable design principles into the learning process itself, enabling the discovery of physically consistent dynamics in a fully data-driven setting. By jointly learning both the numerical flux function and a corresponding entropy, the proposed method ensures conservation and entropy dissipation, critical for long-term stability and fidelity in the system of hyperbolic conservation laws. Numerical results demonstrate that the method achieves stability and conservation over extended time horizons and accurately captures shock propagation speeds, even without oracle access to future-time solution profiles in the training data.

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency, accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match, we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents, highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

Abstract: The Alps Research Infrastructure leverages GH200 technology at scale, featuring 10,752 GPUs. Accessing Alps provides a significant computational advantage for researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). While Alps serves a broad range of scientific communities, traditional HPC services alone are not sufficient to meet the dynamic needs of the ML community. This paper presents an initial investigation into extending HPC service capabilities to better support ML workloads. We identify key challenges and gaps we have observed since the early-access phase (2023) of Alps by the Swiss AI community and propose several technological enhancements. These include a user environment designed to facilitate the adoption of HPC for ML workloads, balancing performance with flexibility; a utility for rapid performance screening of ML applications during development; observability capabilities and data products for inspecting ongoing large-scale ML workloads; a utility to simplify the vetting of allocated nodes for compute readiness; a service plane infrastructure to deploy various types of workloads, including support and inference services; and a storage infrastructure tailored to the specific needs of ML workloads. These enhancements aim to facilitate the execution of ML workloads on HPC systems, increase system usability and resilience, and better align with the needs of the ML community. We also discuss our current approach to security aspects. This paper concludes by placing these proposals in the broader context of changes in the communities served by HPC infrastructure like ours.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening (LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning, thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000 thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases, while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management in high-risk populations.

Abstract: Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers, without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27 datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds, the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable, binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes, addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic materials with tailored properties.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness.

Abstract: We study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition that may vary with the outer minimization variable. In contrast to the global KL or Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) conditions commonly assumed in the literature -- which are significantly stronger and often too restrictive in practice -- this local KL condition accommodates a broader range of practical scenarios. However, it also introduces new analytical challenges. In particular, as an optimization algorithm progresses toward a stationary point of the problem, the region over which the KL condition holds may shrink, resulting in a more intricate and potentially ill-conditioned landscape. To address this challenge, we show that the associated maximal function is locally H\"older smooth. Leveraging this key property, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for solving the minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed by applying a proximal gradient method to a KL-structured subproblem. Under mild assumptions, we establish complexity guarantees for computing an approximate stationary point of the minimax problem.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.

Abstract: Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.

<title>How Well Does GPT-4o Understand Vision? Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks</title>

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.

Abstract: Classification of motor imagery (MI) using non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is a critical objective as it is used to predict the intention of limb movements of a subject. In recent research, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been widely utilized for MI-EEG classification. The challenges of training neural networks for MI-EEG signals classification include low signal-to-noise ratio, non-stationarity, non-linearity, and high complexity of EEG signals. The features computed by CNN-based networks on the highly noisy MI-EEG signals contain irrelevant information. Subsequently, the feature maps of the CNN-based network computed from the noisy and irrelevant features contain irrelevant information. Thus, many non-contributing features often mislead the neural network training and degrade the classification performance. Hence, a novel feature reweighting approach is proposed to address this issue. The proposed method gives a noise reduction mechanism named feature reweighting module that suppresses irrelevant temporal and channel feature maps. The feature reweighting module of the proposed method generates scores that reweight the feature maps to reduce the impact of irrelevant information. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improved the classification of MI-EEG signals of Physionet EEG-MMIDB and BCI Competition IV 2a datasets by a margin of 9.34% and 3.82%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: For nonconvex objective functions, including those found in training deep neural networks, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum is said to converge faster and have better generalizability than SGD without momentum. In particular, adding momentum is thought to reduce stochastic noise. To verify this, we estimated the magnitude of gradient noise by using convergence analysis and an optimal batch size estimation formula and found that momentum does not reduce gradient noise. We also analyzed the effect of search direction noise, which is stochastic noise defined as the error between the search direction of the optimizer and the steepest descent direction, and found that it inherently smooths the objective function and that momentum does not reduce search direction noise either. Finally, an analysis of the degree of smoothing introduced by search direction noise revealed that adding momentum offers limited advantage to SGD.

Abstract: A growing trend has emerged in designing high-quality Small Language Models (SLMs) with a few million parameters. This trend is driven by the increasing concerns over cloud costs, privacy, and latency. Considering that full parameter training is feasible for SLMs on mobile devices, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is employed to improve efficiency by reducing computational overhead and memory footprint. However, previous QAT works adopt fine-grained quantization methods to compress models with billions of parameters on GPUs, incompatible with current commodity hardware, such as mobile and edge devices, which relies on Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions. Thus, the generalization of these methods to SLMs on mobile devices is limited. In this paper, we propose Squat method, an effective QAT framework with deployable quantization for SLMs on mobile devices. Specifically, we propose entropy-guided and distribution-aligned distillation to mitigate the distortion of attention information from quantization. Besides, we employ sub-8-bit token adaptive quantization, assigning varying bit widths to different tokens based on their importance. Furthermore, we develop a SIMD-based Multi-Kernel Mixed-Precision (MKMP) multiplier to support sub-8-bit mixed-precision MAC on mobile devices. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements of our method compared to other QAT methods across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its FP16 counterparts, signaling a great advancement. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/squant

Abstract: Previous studies in predicting crash risks primarily associated the number or likelihood of crashes on a road segment with traffic parameters or geometric characteristics, usually neglecting the impact of vehicles' continuous movement and interactions with nearby vehicles. Recent technology advances, such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are able to collect high-resolution trajectory data, which enables trajectory-based risk analysis. This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). A Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are then employed to predict VG risks using aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks. Overall, this research contributes a new perspective for identifying, predicting, and interpreting traffic risks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents distinct challenges as it relies solely on observational data. A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.

Abstract: Consistency models imitate the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. They can be learned in two ways: consistency distillation and consistency training. The former relies on the true velocity field of the corresponding differential equation, approximated by a pre-trained neural network. In contrast, the latter uses a single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of this velocity field. The related estimation error induces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we show, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding outputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the previously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence but also enhances its overall performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/thibautissenhuth/consistency_GC.

Abstract: Recent advances in large text-conditional diffusion models have revolutionized image generation by enabling users to create realistic, high-quality images from textual prompts, significantly enhancing artistic creation and visual communication. However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.

<title>On the Trade-off between Flatness and Optimization in Distributed Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical framework to evaluate and compare the performance of stochastic gradient algorithms for distributed learning in relation to their behavior around local minima in nonconvex environments. Previous works have noticed that convergence toward flat local minima tend to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms. This work discovers three interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning strategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor convergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second, in decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk performance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local minima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate classification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local minimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In other words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and optimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower excess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from random initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The paper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and optimization error closely. One important conclusion is that decentralized strategies deliver in general enhanced classification accuracy because they strike a more favorable balance between flatness and optimization performance compared to the centralized solution.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to efficiently remove data from a model without retraining it from scratch, in order to remove corrupted or outdated data or respect a user's ``right to be forgotten." Certified machine unlearning is a strong theoretical guarantee based on differential privacy that quantifies the extent to which an algorithm erases data from the model weights. In contrast to existing works in certified unlearning for convex or strongly convex loss functions, or nonconvex objectives with limiting assumptions, we propose the first, first-order, black-box (i.e., can be applied to models pretrained with vanilla gradient descent) algorithm for unlearning on general nonconvex loss functions, which unlearns by ``rewinding" to an earlier step during the learning process before performing gradient descent on the loss function of the retained data points. We prove $(\epsilon, \delta)$ certified unlearning and performance guarantees that establish the privacy-utility-complexity tradeoff of our algorithm, and we prove generalization guarantees for functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods, within a new experimental framework that more accurately reflects unlearning user data in practice.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove specific knowledge from a trained model. Existing approaches, such as Task Arithmetic, fine-tune the model on the forget set to create a task vector (i.e., a direction in weight space) for subtraction from the original model's weight. However, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection, requiring extensive validation to identify the optimal vector from many fine-tuned candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes all fine-tuned models trained with varying hyperparameters instead of a single selection. Specifically, we aggregate the computed task vectors by retaining only the elements with consistent shared signs. The merged task vector is then negated to induce unlearning on the original model. Evaluations on zero-shot and standard image recognition tasks across twelve datasets and four backbone architectures show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring similar or fewer computational resources.

Abstract: This paper presents an initialization method that can approximate a given approximate Ising model with a high degree of accuracy using a factorization machine (FM), a machine learning model. The construction of an Ising models using an FM is applied to black-box combinatorial optimization problems using factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA). It is anticipated that the optimization performance of FMQA will be enhanced through an implementation of the warm-start method. Nevertheless, the optimal initialization method for leveraging the warm-start approach in FMQA remains undetermined. Consequently, the present study compares initialization methods based on random initialization and low-rank approximation, and then identifies a suitable one for use with warm-start in FMQA through numerical experiments. Furthermore, the properties of the initialization method by the low-rank approximation for the FM are analyzed using random matrix theory, demonstrating that the approximation accuracy of the proposed method is not significantly influenced by the specific Ising model under consideration. The findings of this study will facilitate advancements of research in the field of black-box combinatorial optimization through the use of Ising machines.

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission in next-generation networks, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. This is particularly important in 6G-enabled Internet of Things (6G-IoT) scenarios, where bandwidth constraints, latency requirements, and data privacy are critical. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck inspired method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the absence of reliable and reproducible methods to quantify the minimality of encoded feature vectors, we introduce the Information Retention Index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input. The IRI reflects how minimal and informative the representation is, making it highly relevant for privacy-preserving and bandwidth-efficient 6G-IoT systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI, making it a promising building block for responsible, efficient and trustworthy 6G-IoT services.

Abstract: The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. The code is released at https://github.com/MyLearnCodeSpace/Adaptive-NAD.

Abstract: A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.

Abstract: Although recent quantized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet, have paved the way for significant reduction in memory usage during deployment with binary or ternary weights, training these models still demands substantial memory footprints. This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weights required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore directly updating the quantized low-precision weights without relying on straight-through estimation during backpropagation, aiming to save memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize the information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models of various sizes indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values; (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits achieves performance on par with BitNet b1.58; (3) our models remain robust to precision scaling and memory reduction, showing minimal performance degradation when moving from FP32 to lower-memory environments (BF16/FP8); and (4) our models also support inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.

<title>Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Need Not Retain Offline Data</title>

Abstract: The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse data, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset, followed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL fine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability and performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse offline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and in principle, also limit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism on offline data. In this paper, we show that retaining offline data is unnecessary as long as we use a properly-designed online RL approach for fine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, we start by analyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. We find that continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a sudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by a distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This divergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of offline pre-training. Our approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple idea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very small number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The data collected during warmup helps ``recalibrate'' the offline Q-function to the online distribution, allowing us to completely discard offline data without destabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. We show that WSRL is able to fine-tune without retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains higher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they retain offline data or not.

Abstract: In MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games), abnormal players (bots) using unauthorized automated programs to carry out pre-defined behaviors systematically and repeatedly are commonly observed. Bots usually engage in these activities to gain in-game money, which they eventually trade for real money outside the game. Such abusive activities negatively impact the in-game experiences of legitimate users since bots monopolize specific hunting areas and obtain valuable items. Thus, detecting abnormal players is a significant task for game companies. Motivated by the fact that bots tend to behave collectively with similar in-game trajectories due to the auto-programs, we developed BotTRep, a framework that comprises trajectory representation learning followed by clustering using a completely unlabeled in-game trajectory dataset. Our model aims to learn representations for in-game trajectory sequences so that players with contextually similar trajectories have closer embeddings. Then, by applying DBSCAN to these representations and visualizing the corresponding moving patterns, our framework ultimately assists game masters in identifying and banning bots.

Abstract: Monitoring real-time air quality is essential for safeguarding public health and fostering social progress. However, the widespread deployment of air quality monitoring stations is constrained by their significant costs. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{AirRadar}, a deep neural network designed to accurately infer real-time air quality in locations lacking monitoring stations by utilizing data from existing ones. By leveraging learnable mask tokens, AirRadar reconstructs air quality features in unmonitored regions. Specifically, it operates in two stages: first capturing spatial correlations and then adjusting for distribution shifts. We validate AirRadar's efficacy using a year-long dataset from 1,085 monitoring stations across China, demonstrating its superiority over multiple baselines, even with varying degrees of unobserved data. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/AirRadar.

Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated PDE-based, inverse problems is a central task in engineering and physics, yet existing neural operator methods struggle with high-dimensional, discontinuous inputs and require large amounts of {\em labeled} training data. We propose the Deep Generative Neural Operator (DGenNO), a physics-aware framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a deep, generative, probabilistic model in combination with a set of lower-dimensional, latent variables that simultaneously encode PDE-inputs and PDE-outputs. This formulation can make use of unlabeled data and significantly improves inverse problem-solving, particularly for discontinuous or discrete-valued input functions. DGenNO enforces physics constraints without labeled data by incorporating as virtual observables, weak-form residuals based on compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs). These relax regularity constraints and eliminate higher-order derivatives from the objective function. We also introduce MultiONet, a novel neural operator architecture, which is a more expressive generalization of the popular DeepONet that significantly enhances the approximating power of the proposed model. These innovations make DGenNO particularly effective for challenging forward and inverse, PDE-based problems, such as those involving multi-phase media. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DGenNO achieves higher accuracy across multiple benchmarks while exhibiting robustness to noise and strong generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Its adaptability, and the ability to handle sparse, noisy data while providing probabilistic estimates, make DGenNO a powerful tool for scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are prevalent across a wide variety of domains. These problems are often nuanced, their optimal solutions might not be efficiently obtainable, and they may require lots of time and compute resources to solve (they are NP-hard). It follows that the best course of action for solving these problems is to use general optimization algorithm paradigms to quickly and easily develop algorithms that are customized to these problems and can produce good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we present optimizn, a Python library for developing customized optimization algorithms under general optimization algorithm paradigms (simulated annealing, branch and bound). Additionally, optimizn offers continuous training, with which users can run their algorithms on a regular cadence, retain the salient aspects of previous runs, and use them in subsequent runs to potentially produce solutions that get closer and closer to optimality. An earlier version of this paper was peer reviewed and published internally at Microsoft.

Abstract: While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.

Abstract: The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in a distributed manner poses significant challenges on resource-constrained edge networks. To address this challenge, we propose SflLLM, a novel framework that integrates split federated learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. By leveraging model splitting and low-rank adaptation (LoRA), SflLLM reduces the computational burden on edge devices. Furthermore, the introduction of a federated server facilitates parallel training and enhances data privacy. To accommodate heterogeneous communication conditions and diverse computational capabilities of edge devices, as well as the impact of LoRA rank selection on model convergence and training cost, we formulate a joint optimization problem of both communication and computation resource. The formulated problem jointly optimizes subchannel allocation, power control, model splitting point selection, and LoRA rank configuration, aimed at minimizing total training delay. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem efficiently. Specifically, a greedy heuristic is employed for subchannel allocation, the power control subproblem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem using auxiliary variables, and an exhaustive search is adopted for optimal split position and rank selection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SflLLM framework achieves comparable model accuracy while significantly reducing client-side computational requirements. Furthermore, the proposed resource allocation scheme and adaptive LoRA rank selection strategy notably reduce the training latency compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.

Abstract: In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{nonlinear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions. Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However, interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs, achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast, reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect inputs.

Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1). Code is available at https://github.com/hanyuki23/SoP.

Abstract: Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible, enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/Beta4-UCS. An extended abstract related to this work is available at https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.174900805.59801248/v1.

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal a new direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/TiViT.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

<title>Rank-1 Matrix Completion with Gradient Descent and Small Random Initialization</title>

Abstract: The nonconvex formulation of the matrix completion problem has received significant attention in recent years due to its affordable complexity compared to the convex formulation. Gradient Descent (GD) is a simple yet efficient baseline algorithm for solving nonconvex optimization problems. The success of GD has been witnessed in many different problems in both theory and practice when it is combined with random initialization. However, previous works on matrix completion require either careful initialization or regularizers to prove the convergence of GD. In this paper, we study the rank-1 symmetric matrix completion and prove that GD converges to the ground truth when small random initialization is used. We show that in a logarithmic number of iterations, the trajectory enters the region where local convergence occurs. We provide an upper bound on the initialization size that is sufficient to guarantee the convergence, and show that a larger initialization can be used as more samples are available. We observe that the implicit regularization effect of GD plays a critical role in the analysis, and for the entire trajectory, it prevents each entry from becoming much larger than the others.

Abstract: A learned database system uses machine learning (ML) internally to improve performance. We can expect such systems to be vulnerable to some adversarial-ML attacks. Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting users or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches, potentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared to attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as they cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the difference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of the same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks that the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of potentially-increased attack surface in learned database systems and develop a framework for identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We apply our framework to a broad set of learned components currently being explored in the database community. To empirically validate the vulnerabilities surfaced by our framework, we choose 3 of them and implement and evaluate exploits against these. We show that the use of ML cause leakage of past queries in a database, enable a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory blowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enable index users to snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own keys. We find that adversarial ML is an universal threat against learned components in database systems, point to open research gaps in our understanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing mitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose learned component is shared between multiple parties.

<title>Combating Confirmation Bias: A Unified Pseudo-Labeling Framework for Entity Alignment</title>

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment.

Abstract: Empirical studies have widely demonstrated that neural networks are highly sensitive to small, adversarial perturbations of the input. The worst-case robustness against these so-called adversarial examples can be quantified by the Lipschitz constant of the neural network. In this paper, we study upper and lower bounds for the Lipschitz constant of random ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we assume that the weights and biases follow a generalization of the He initialization, where general symmetric distributions for the biases are permitted. For deep networks of fixed depth and sufficiently large width, our established upper bound is larger than the lower bound by a factor that is logarithmic in the width. In contrast, for shallow neural networks we characterize the Lipschitz constant up to an absolute numerical constant that is independent of all parameters.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact synthetic dataset that enables models to achieve performance comparable to training on the full large dataset, significantly reducing computational costs. Drawing from optimal transport theory, we introduce WMDD (Wasserstein Metric-based Dataset Distillation), a straightforward yet powerful method that employs the Wasserstein metric to enhance distribution matching.
  We compute the Wasserstein barycenter of features from a pretrained classifier to capture essential characteristics of the original data distribution. By optimizing synthetic data to align with this barycenter in feature space and leveraging per-class BatchNorm statistics to preserve intra-class variations, WMDD maintains the efficiency of distribution matching approaches while achieving state-of-the-art results across various high-resolution datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate WMDD's effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting its potential for advancing machine learning applications at scale.

<title>SpikeNAS: A Fast Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search Framework for Spiking Neural Network-based Embedded AI Systems</title>

arXiv:2402.11322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedded AI systems are expected to incur low power/energy consumption for solving machine learning tasks, as these systems are usually power constrained (e.g., object recognition task in autonomous mobile agents with portable batteries). These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since their bio-inspired spike-based operations offer high accuracy and ultra low-power/energy computation. Currently, most of SNN architectures are derived from Artificial Neural Networks whose neurons' architectures and operations are different from SNNs, and/or developed without considering memory budgets from the underlying processing hardware of embedded platforms. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose SpikeNAS, a novel fast memory-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for SNNs that quickly finds an appropriate SNN architecture with high accuracy under the given memory budgets from targeted embedded systems. To do this, our SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality, developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm, and performing quantization. The experimental results show that our SpikeNAS improves the searching time and maintains high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art while meeting the given memory budgets (e.g., 29x, 117x, and 3.7x faster search for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200 respectively, using an Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU machine), thereby quickly providing the appropriate SNN architecture for the memory-constrained embedded AI systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation often produce overconfident results misaligned with empirical observations. Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset. We share our code here: https://github.com/cai4cai/ACE-DLIRIS

Abstract: Obstetric ultrasound image quality is crucial for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of fetal health. However, acquiring high-quality standard planes is difficult, influenced by the sonographer's expertise and factors like the maternal BMI or fetus dynamics. In this work, we explore diffusion-based counterfactual explainable AI to generate realistic, high-quality standard planes from low-quality non-standard ones. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating plausible counterfactuals of increased quality. This shows future promise for enhancing training of clinicians by providing visual feedback and potentially improving standard plane quality and acquisition for downstream diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: This work views the multi-agent system and its surrounding environment as a co-evolving system, where the behavior of one affects the other. The goal is to take both agent actions and environment configurations as decision variables, and optimize these two components in a coordinated manner to improve some measure of interest. Towards this end, we consider the problem of decentralized multi-agent navigation in a cluttered environment, where we assume that the layout of the environment is reconfigurable. By introducing two sub-objectives -- multi-agent navigation and environment optimization -- we propose an agent-environment co-optimization problem and develop a coordinated algorithm that alternates between these sub-objectives to search for an optimal synthesis of agent actions and environment configurations; ultimately, improving the navigation performance. Due to the challenge of explicitly modeling the relation between the agents, the environment and their performance therein, we leverage policy gradient to formulate a model-free learning mechanism within the coordinated framework. A formal convergence analysis shows that our coordinated algorithm tracks the local minimum solution of an associated time-varying non-convex optimization problem. Experiments corroborate theoretical findings and show the benefits of co-optimization. Interestingly, the results also indicate that optimized environments can offer structural guidance to de-conflict agents in motion.

Abstract: In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.

Abstract: Teeth segmentation and recognition play a vital role in a variety of dental applications and diagnostic procedures. The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. In addition, this paper presents the OralBBNet architecture, which is based on the best segmentation and detection qualities of architectures such as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for tooth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions for various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score compared to other SOTA segmentation architectures. The results of this study establish a foundation for the wider implementation of object detection models in dental diagnostics.

Abstract: In remote control systems, transmitting large data volumes (e.g., images, video frames) from wireless sensors to remote controllers is challenging when uplink capacity is limited (e.g., RedCap devices or massive wireless sensor networks). Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel conditions and age of information (AoI). Simulations on inverted cart-pole systems show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional control baselines in communication efficiency, control cost, and predictive accuracy. It enables robust and scalable control under limited network capacity compared to traditional scheduling schemes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug development. One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to efficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research. Code is available at https://github.com/bing1100/Imagand.

Abstract: Merging datasets across institutions is a lengthy and costly procedure, especially when it involves private information. Data hosts may therefore want to prospectively gauge which datasets are most beneficial to merge with, without revealing sensitive information. For causal estimation this is particularly challenging as the value of a merge depends not only on reduction in epistemic uncertainty but also on improvement in overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the first cryptographically secure information-theoretic approach for quantifying the value of a merge in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We do this by evaluating the Expected Information Gain (EIG) using multi-party computation to ensure that no raw data is revealed. We further demonstrate that our approach can be combined with differential privacy (DP) to meet arbitrary privacy requirements whilst preserving more accurate computation compared to DP alone. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first privacy-preserving method for dataset acquisition tailored to causal estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method on a range of simulated and realistic benchmarks. Code is publicly available: https://github.com/LucileTerminassian/causal_prospective_merge.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of long-context linear system identification, where the state $x_t$ of a dynamical system at time $t$ depends linearly on previous states $x_s$ over a fixed context window of length $p$. We establish a sample complexity bound that matches the i.i.d. parametric rate up to logarithmic factors for a broad class of systems, extending previous works that considered only first-order dependencies. Our findings reveal a learning-without-mixing phenomenon, indicating that learning long-context linear autoregressive models is not hindered by slow mixing properties potentially associated with extended context windows. Additionally, we extend these results to (i) shared low-rank representations, where rank-regularized estimators improve the dependence of the rates on the dimensionality, and (ii) misspecified context lengths in strictly stable systems, where shorter contexts offer statistical advantages.

Abstract: Estimating the variability of seasonal snow cover, in particular snow depth in remote areas, poses significant challenges due to limited spatial and temporal data availability. This study uses snow depth measurements from the ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which are sparse in both space and time, and incorporates them with climate reanalysis data into a downscaling-calibration scheme to produce monthly gridded snow depth maps at microscale (10 m). Snow surface elevation measurements from ICESat-2 along profiles are compared to a digital elevation model to determine snow depth at each point. To efficiently turn sparse measurements into snow depth maps, a regression model is fitted to establish a relationship between the retrieved snow depth and the corresponding ERA5 Land snow depth. This relationship, referred to as subgrid variability, is then applied to downscale the monthly ERA5 Land snow depth data. The method can provide timeseries of monthly snow depth maps for the entire ERA5 time range (since 1950). The validation of downscaled snow depth data was performed at an intermediate scale (100 m x 500 m) using datasets from airborne laser scanning (ALS) in the Hardangervidda region of southern Norway. Results show that snow depth prediction achieved R2 values ranging from 0.74 to 0.88 (post-calibration). The method relies on globally available data and is applicable to other snow regions above the treeline. Though requiring area-specific calibration, our approach has the potential to provide snow depth maps in areas where no such data exist and can be used to extrapolate existing snow surveys in time and over larger areas. With this, it can offer valuable input data for hydrological, ecological or permafrost modeling tasks.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn a latent space whose samples can be mapped to real-world images. Such latent spaces are difficult to interpret. Some earlier supervised methods aim to create an interpretable latent space or discover interpretable directions, which requires exploiting data labels or annotated synthesized samples for training. However, we propose using a modification of vector quantization called space-filling vector quantization (SFVQ), which quantizes the data on a piece-wise linear curve. SFVQ can capture the underlying morphological structure of the latent space, making it interpretable. We apply this technique to model the latent space of pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN networks on various datasets. Our experiments show that the SFVQ curve yields a general interpretable model of the latent space such that it determines which parts of the latent space correspond to specific generative factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each line of the SFVQ curve can potentially refer to an interpretable direction for applying intelligible image transformations. We also demonstrate that the points located on an SFVQ line can be used for controllable data augmentation.

<title>Dynamic Matching with Post-allocation Service and its Application to Refugee Resettlement</title>

Abstract: Motivated by our collaboration with a major refugee resettlement agency in the U.S., we study a dynamic matching problem where each new arrival (a refugee case) must be matched immediately and irrevocably to one of the static resources (a location with a fixed annual quota). In addition to consuming the static resource, each case requires post-allocation services from a server, such as a translator. Given the uncertainty in service time, a server may not be available at a given time, thus we refer to it as a dynamic resource. Upon matching, the case will wait to avail service in a first-come-first-serve manner. Bursty matching to a location may result in undesirable congestion at its corresponding server. Consequently, the central planner (the agency) faces a dynamic matching problem with an objective that combines the matching reward (captured by pair-specific employment outcomes) with the cost for congestion for dynamic resources and over-allocation for the static ones. Motivated by the observed fluctuations in the composition of refugee pools across the years, we aim to design algorithms that do not rely on distributional knowledge. We develop learning-based algorithms that are asymptotically optimal in certain regimes, easy to interpret, and computationally fast. Our design is based on learning the dual variables of the underlying optimization problem; however, the main challenge lies in the time-varying nature of the dual variables associated with dynamic resources. Our theoretical development brings together techniques from Lyapunov analysis, adversarial online learning, and stochastic optimization. On the application side, when tested on real data from our partner agency and incorporating practical considerations, our method outperforms existing ones making it a viable candidate for replacing the current practice upon experimentation.

<title>Unified Triplet-Level Hallucination Evaluation for Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.

<title>SURE-VQA: Systematic Understanding of Robustness Evaluation in Medical VQA Tasks</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts on unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework, called \textit{SURE-VQA}, centered around three key requirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM robustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models (LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the robustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets with four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into robustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and 2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution shifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the image data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the best-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

<title>Embedding-Space Diffusion for Zero-Shot Environmental Sound Classification</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot learning enables models to generalise to unseen classes by leveraging semantic information, bridging the gap between training and testing sets with non-overlapping classes. While much research has focused on zero-shot learning in computer vision, the application of these methods to environmental audio remains underexplored, with poor performance in existing studies. Generative methods, which have demonstrated success in computer vision, are notably absent from zero-shot environmental sound classification studies.
  To address this gap, this work investigates generative methods for zero-shot learning in environmental audio. Two successful generative models from computer vision are adapted: a cross-aligned and distribution-aligned variational autoencoder (CADA-VAE) and a leveraging invariant side generative adversarial network (LisGAN). Additionally, we introduced a novel diffusion model conditioned on class auxiliary data. Synthetic embeddings generated by the diffusion model are combined with seen class embeddings to train a classifier.
  Experiments are conducted on five environmental audio datasets, ESC-50, ARCA23K-FSD, FSC22, UrbanSound8k and TAU Urban Acoustics 2019, and one music classification dataset, GTZAN. Results show that the diffusion model outperforms all baseline methods on average across six audio datasets.
  This work establishes the diffusion model as a promising approach for zero-shot learning and introduces the first benchmark of generative methods for zero-shot environmental sound classification, providing a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for safeguarding digital infrastructure. In dynamic network environments, both threat landscapes and normal operational behaviors are constantly changing, resulting in concept drift. While continuous learning mitigates the adverse effects of concept drift, insufficient attention to drift patterns and excessive preservation of outdated knowledge can still hinder the IDS's adaptability. In this paper, we propose SSF (Strategic Selection and Forgetting), a novel continual learning method for IDS, providing continuous model updates with a constantly refreshed memory buffer. Our approach features a strategic sample selection algorithm to select representative new samples and a strategic forgetting mechanism to drop outdated samples. The proposed strategic sample selection algorithm prioritizes new samples that cause the `drifted' pattern, enabling the model to better understand the evolving landscape. Additionally, we introduce strategic forgetting upon detecting significant drift by discarding outdated samples to free up memory, allowing the incorporation of more recent data. SSF captures evolving patterns effectively and ensures the model is aligned with the change of data patterns, significantly enhancing the IDS's adaptability to concept drift. The state-of-the-art performance of SSF on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets demonstrates its superior adaptability to concept drift for network intrusion detection. The code is released at https://github.com/xinchen930/SSF-Strategic-Selection-and-Forgetting.

Abstract: Temporal embryo images and parental fertility table indicators are both valuable for pregnancy prediction in \textbf{in vitro fertilization embryo transfer} (IVF-ET). However, current machine learning models cannot make full use of the complementary information between the two modalities to improve pregnancy prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a Decoupling Fusion Network called DeFusion to effectively integrate the multi-modal information for IVF-ET pregnancy prediction. Specifically, we propose a decoupling fusion module that decouples the information from the different modalities into related and unrelated information, thereby achieving a more delicate fusion. And we fuse temporal embryo images with a spatial-temporal position encoding, and extract fertility table indicator information with a table transformer. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we use a new dataset including 4046 cases collected from Southern Medical University. The experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the performance on the eye disease prediction dataset reflects the model's good generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ou-Young-1999/DFNet.

Abstract: This paper focuses on linear regression models with non-conjugate sparsity-inducing regularizers such as lasso and group lasso. Although the empirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter, little is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, many aspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of automatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs remain unexplained. In this paper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized linear regression models with limited parameters. It is shown that the estimators diverge under a specific condition, giving rise to the ARD mechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce the ARD mechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the conditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can do so.

<title>Distributional Information Embedding: A Framework for Multi-bit Watermarking</title>

arXiv:2501.16558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding, motivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds information into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls the text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a detectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze this distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality, detectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the entropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable distortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve this rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case with non-i.i.d. tokens, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering to constraints on false alarm and distortion.

Abstract: Do the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset. ConceptAttention works for popular image models and even seamlessly generalizes to video generation. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiTs are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation.

Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning aims to generate descriptive text from remote sensing images, typically employing an encoder-decoder framework. In this setup, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature representations from the input image, which then guide the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence caption generation process. Although much research has focused on refining the decoder, the quality of image representations from the encoder remains crucial for accurate captioning. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates features from two distinct CNN based encoders, capturing complementary information to enhance caption generation. Additionally, we propose a weighted averaging technique to combine the outputs of all GRUs in the stacked decoder. Furthermore, a comparison-based beam search strategy is incorporated to refine caption selection. The results demonstrate that our fusion-based approach, along with the enhanced stacked decoder, significantly outperforms both the transformer-based state-of-the-art model and other LSTM-based baselines.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer learning method called \underline{\textbf{D}}istribution \underline{\textbf{M}}atching (DM), which drives the representation distribution toward a predefined reference distribution while preserving augmentation invariance. DM results in a learned representation space that is intuitively structured and therefore easy to interpret.
  Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrate that DM performs competitively on target classification tasks compared to existing self-supervised transfer learning methods. Additionally, we provide robust theoretical guarantees for DM, including a population theorem and an end-to-end sample theorem. The population theorem bridges the gap between the self-supervised learning task and target classification accuracy, while the sample theorem shows that, even with a limited number of samples from the target domain, DM can deliver exceptional classification performance, provided the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large.

Abstract: When interacting with objects, humans effectively reason about which regions of objects are viable for an intended action, i.e., the affordance regions of the object. They can also account for subtle differences in object regions based on the task to be performed and whether one or two hands need to be used. However, current vision-based affordance prediction methods often reduce the problem to naive object part segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting affordance data from human activity video datasets. Our extracted 2HANDS dataset contains precise object affordance region segmentations and affordance class-labels as narrations of the activity performed. The data also accounts for bimanual actions, i.e., two hands co-ordinating and interacting with one or more objects. We present a VLM-based affordance prediction model, 2HandedAfforder, trained on the dataset and demonstrate superior performance over baselines in affordance region segmentation for various activities. Finally, we show that our predicted affordance regions are actionable, i.e., can be used by an agent performing a task, through demonstration in robotic manipulation scenarios.

arXiv:2503.11054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While diffusion models show promising results in image editing given a target prompt, achieving both prompt fidelity and background preservation remains difficult. Recent works have introduced score distillation techniques that leverage the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models to solve this task without additional fine-tuning. However, these methods often struggle with tasks such as object insertion. Our investigation of these failures reveals significant variations in gradient magnitude and spatial distribution, making hyperparameter tuning highly input-specific or unsuccessful. To address this, we propose two simple yet effective modifications: attention-based spatial regularization and gradient filtering-normalization, both aimed at reducing these variations during gradient updates. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art score distillation techniques in prompt fidelity, improving successful edits while preserving the background. Users also preferred our method over state-of-the-art techniques across three metrics, and by 58-64% overall.

Abstract: With the advent of automatic vectorization tools (e.g., JAX's $\texttt{vmap}$), writing multi-chain MCMC algorithms is often now as simple as invoking those tools on single-chain code. Whilst convenient, for various MCMC algorithms this results in a synchronization problem -- loosely speaking, at each iteration all chains running in parallel must wait until the last chain has finished drawing its sample. In this work, we show how to design single-chain MCMC algorithms in a way that avoids synchronization overheads when vectorizing with tools like $\texttt{vmap}$ by using the framework of finite state machines (FSMs). Using a simplified model, we derive an exact theoretical form of the obtainable speed-ups using our approach, and use it to make principled recommendations for optimal algorithm design. We implement several popular MCMC algorithms as FSMs, including Elliptical Slice Sampling, HMC-NUTS, and Delayed Rejection, demonstrating speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude in experiments.

Abstract: As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

Abstract: The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of context-aware reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop context-aware reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining a tighter characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.

Abstract: We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This evolving intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting open-source large language models (LLMs, original and fine-tuned), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem, supporting AI-enhanced computational chemistry tasks ranging from ground- to excited-state calculations such as geometry optimizations, thermochemistry, and spectra calculations. Aitomia is the first intelligent assistant publicly accessible online on a cloud computing platform for atomistic simulations of broad scope (Aitomistic Hub at https://aitomistic.xyz), while it may also be deployed locally as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, democratizing simulations, and accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.

<title>Pre-training Large Memory Language Models with Internal and External Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.

<title>Self-reflective Uncertainties: Do LLMs Know Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>

Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response, uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs, the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. To support the development of this universal form of LLM uncertainties, we publish our metric at https://github.com/apple/ml-selfreflect

<title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: We prove that perfect hallucination control in large language models is mathematically impossible. No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms existing algorithms for rule extraction.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) face precision loss due to information spreading, seen as a communication problem rather than computational precision issue. The proposed solution, HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), utilizes hypertokens and combines classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search to address the key-value (K:V) and value-key (V:K) memory problems in transformer architectures. By leveraging phase-coherent memory addresses, HDRAM enables efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in the latent space. Through a combination of ECC grammar, compressed sensing, and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM enhances associative retrieval without requiring architectural changes. By integrating Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles, HDRAM strengthens transformer architectures and improves the overall performance of Large Language Models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes, demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can fortify transformer architectures.

<div> NeutroSENSE, intrusion detection, IoT environments, neutrosophic logic, uncertainty quantification, abstention <br />
<br />Summary: 
The paper introduces NeutroSENSE, an ensemble framework for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT settings. By incorporating Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the system breaks down prediction confidence into truth, falsity, and indeterminacy components, enabling uncertainty measurement and abstention. Suspicious predictions with high indeterminacy are identified for review using global and adaptive class-specific thresholds. Evaluations on the IoT-CAD dataset show NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, with misclassified samples displaying significantly higher indeterminacy scores. The utilization of indeterminacy as a measure for uncertainty allows informed abstention and targeted reviews, especially beneficial in edge deployments. Figures and tables confirm the relationship between indeterminacy scores and error probabilities, enhancing trust in human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This study demonstrates that neutrosophic logic improves both accuracy and explainability, laying the groundwork for trustworthy AI systems in edge and fog-based IoT security. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62) than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy, human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the directed stochastic skill search (DS3) framework for efficient inference in large language models. It explores different inference strategies such as chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT) and analyzes task success and compute cost based on task difficulty and model capability. By incorporating inference into a tripartite graph framework of LLM training and connecting DS3 with empirical scaling behavior studies, the framework reveals patterns such as linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute and varied preferred inference strategies. It also highlights emergent behavior from reasoning tasks, best-of-N and majority voting behavior, and interdependencies between training and inference. This theoretical framework enhances understanding and enables principled algorithmic design and resource allocation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden, particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought (ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling; and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Summary: <br />
Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is crucial for minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Traditional heuristic-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and combinatorial nature of dispatching, prompting the use of an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS). The system models a six-elevator, fifteen-floor setup at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process. Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle complexity, the introduction of infra-steps for continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward signal for efficient learning. Various adaptations of the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation are explored. The RL-based EGCS, based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, proves adept at adapting to traffic patterns, learning in a stochastic environment, and outperforming a traditional rule-based algorithm. <br /> <div>

<div> undistillable DNN, knowledge distillation, label smoothing, deep neural network, training method <br />
Summary: <br />
- Undistillable deep neural networks (DNNs) are challenging to distill using knowledge distillation (KD) methods, ensuring protection of intellectual property.
- Observing that highly concentrated output probability distributions can lead to undistillability, the CMI minimized (CMIM) method minimizes conditional mutual information (CMI) values during training.
- The CMIM model, trained with both cross entropy (CE) loss and CMI values, is undistillable by existing KD methods and outperforms models trained with CE loss alone.
- Knockoff students distilled from the CMIM model perform worse than label smoothing (LS) students.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CMIM model in achieving undistillability and improving prediction accuracy. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information (CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed, which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE) loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

<div> Seasonal-trend decomposition, Masked time-series modeling, Entangled patterns, Period masking strategy, Sub-series masking strategy <br />
Summary:<br /> Forecasting complex time series is challenging due to intricate temporal dependencies. Masked time-series modeling (MTM) reconstructs masked segments from unmasked ones but may learn spurious patterns. To address entangled patterns, ST-MTM proposes a seasonal-trend decomposition approach with novel masking methods for seasonal and trend components. It uses period masking for seasonal components and sub-series masking for trend components to capture distinct temporal semantics effectively. ST-MTM introduces contrastive learning to enhance contextual consistency among masked seasonal representations. Experimental results show superior forecasting performance of ST-MTM compared to existing methods in terms of masked modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting. <div>

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally, ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on static code-generation benchmarks, but real-world software development unfolds as a continuous stream of evolving issues, fixes, and feature requests. We introduce SWE-Bench-CL, a novel continual learning benchmark built on the human-verified SWE-Bench Verified dataset introduced by OpenAI and Princeton-NLP in 2024. By organizing GitHub issues into chronologically ordered sequences that reflect natural repository evolution, SWE-Bench-CL enables direct evaluation of an agent's ability to accumulate experience, transfer knowledge across tasks, and resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting, forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python repositories. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thomasjoshi/agents-never-forget, providing the community with a reproducible platform for developing more adaptive and robust AI agents in software engineering.

<div> transformer, modulation classification, adversarial attacks, vision transformer, AdvI token

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to mitigate adversarial attacks in radio signal classification. A new vision transformer architecture incorporating an adversarial indicator (AdvI) token is proposed, providing a unified approach that combines training time defense and running time defense in a single neural network model. The AdvI token influences attention weights within the transformer model, highlighting suspicious regions in input data. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in handling white-box attack scenarios compared to existing methods. The proposed approach surpasses competitive methods, including fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks, and basic iterative method. The integration of adversarial training with detection mechanism using AdvI token enhances system robustness and simplifies the architecture, offering a valuable contribution to the field of automatic modulation classification for IoT devices. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism. We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT, influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and basic iterative method.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

<div> framework, supervised fine-tuning, preference learning, large language models, mathematical derivation
Summary:
The article introduces a theoretical framework that connects Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). It demonstrates that SFT and preference learning methods operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT being a special case of implicit reward learning. A limitation of conventional SFT is identified where the KL divergence term remains constant during optimization, hindering model updates. To address this, a learning rate reduction approach is proposed, resulting in significant performance improvements in instruction following tasks. Alternative SFT objectives based on f-divergence functions are derived to enhance post-DPO model performance. Furthermore, the relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning is extended to the SFT context, with mathematical derivations and experimental validation. <div>

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to \textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and experimental validation.

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy (GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) approach to improving the efficiency and flexibility of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods in Bayesian inverse problems. By using a data-driven approach, the VAE framework can capture a wider range of correlation structures, particularly beneficial in subsurface flow modeling for tasks like groundwater flow inversion. Results from a synthetic groundwater flow inversion problem show that the VAE-based parameterization achieves similar accuracy to traditional methods like the Karhunen-Loève Expansion (KLE) when the correlation length is known and surpasses KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Additionally, the VAE approach reduces stochastic dimensionality, enhancing computational efficiency. This research suggests that integrating deep generative models, like VAE, in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian inference in complex, high-dimensional problems.<br /> <div>

Abstract: This study uses a Variational Autoencoder method to enhance the efficiency and applicability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating broader-spectrum prior proposals. Traditional approaches, such as the Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE), require previous knowledge of the covariance function, often unavailable in practical applications. The VAE framework enables a data-driven approach to flexibly capture a broader range of correlation structures in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly subsurface flow modeling. The methodology is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow inversion problem, where pressure data is used to estimate permeability fields. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the VAE-based parameterization achieves comparable accuracy to KLE when the correlation length is known and outperforms KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Moreover, the VAE approach significantly reduces stochastic dimensionality, improving computational efficiency. The results suggest that leveraging deep generative models in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian inference in high-dimensional problems.

arXiv:2507.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design. To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool, accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\% elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), a method that can generalize to new dynamics by adapting in the Fourier space. FNSDA identifies common dynamics from known environments through automatic partitioning in Fourier modes and adjusts specific modes for new environments using low-dimensional latent systematic parameters. Evaluation on four dynamic system families shows FNSDA achieves superior or comparable generalization performance with reduced parameters. The approach offers promise for modeling complex physical dynamics and improving generalization in unseen systems governed by similar dynamics but varying environmental characteristics. This work contributes to enhancing the reliability and efficiency of deep neural networks in learning underlying dynamics from data. <div>
arXiv:2507.00025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics. However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space. Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, safety evaluation, adversarial prompting, automated prompt generation, Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE)

Summary: 
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed in real-world applications, necessitating the need for adaptive and comprehensive safety evaluations.
- Manual safety benchmarks are limited in their static nature and require intensive labor to update, hindering keeping pace with LLM advancements.
- Automated adversarial prompt generation can provide adaptive evaluation but current methods lack topic diversity and real-world contextualization.
- The proposed framework, Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), utilizes multi-objective reinforcement learning to generate diverse and context-rich adversarial prompts.
- Experiments demonstrate that ROSE outperforms existing methods in exposing safety vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with improvements in evaluation metrics.

<br /><br />Summary: As LLMs are increasingly utilized in real-world applications, the need for adaptive safety evaluations is crucial. Manual benchmarks are limited by their static nature, requiring labor-intensive updates. Automated adversarial prompt generation shows promise but lacks topic diversity and real-world alignment. The ROSE framework, employing multi-objective reinforcement learning, generates diverse and context-rich adversarial prompts, outperforming existing methods in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2507.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts. Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful text.

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress, the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations.

The LoRA-Mixer framework is proposed as a lightweight and modular mixture-of-experts approach for adapting large language models to multiple tasks. It integrates task-specific LoRA experts by replacing the projection matrices of the attention module with dynamically routed experts. This design ensures compatibility with various foundation models and supports joint optimization of experts and routing mechanisms or direct deployment of pre-trained modules. An adaptive Specialization Balance Loss is introduced to optimize expert balance and task-specific alignment. Extensive experiments show significant improvements in performance on benchmark datasets compared to base models and state-of-the-art methods, with increased efficiency using fewer parameters. <div>
arXiv:2507.00029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts. This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models, including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained, frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss (SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA, SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively, using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong performance.

Summary:
The study focuses on accurate modeling of human mobility in the context of epidemic spread, using data from Peru's Digital Contact Tracing application during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research addresses the challenge of sparse hourly mobility data in hexagonal grid cells by introducing a Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique that incorporates signals from neighboring cells.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of human mobility is critical for understanding epidemic spread and deploying timely interventions. In this work, we leverage a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public health crises.

<div> neural network, critical heat flux, CHF dataset, spatially varying power profiles, transfer-learning strategies

Summary: 
This study compiles and digitizes a diverse dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) to support the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark Phase II. Classical CHF correlations are found to have significant errors under uniform heating and perform poorly with non-uniform heating profiles. Modern tabular methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network trained on uniform data performs well in uniform scenarios but struggles with spatially varying power profiles, highlighting the importance of incorporating axial power distributions in models. The curated datasets and baseline modeling results provided in this study pave the way for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification, and design optimization in the upcoming phase of the CHF benchmark. <div>

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh, validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification, and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

<div> Keywords: drifting icebergs, polar oceans, deep learning model, IDRIFTNET, iceberg trajectories

Summary:
Drifting icebergs in polar oceans have significant impacts on Earth's climate system, freshwater fluxes, ecosystems, and navigation. Forecasting their trajectories accurately is challenging due to limited spatiotemporal data and complex nonlinear motion influenced by environmental variables. The IDRIFTNET model proposed in this study combines physics-driven analytical formulation with deep learning to capture iceberg drift dynamics effectively. By learning the discrepancies between analytical solutions and observations, coupled with a spectral neural network, IDRIFTNET outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting the trajectories of Antarctic icebergs A23A and B22A. The model demonstrates lower Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across various time points, showcasing its ability to forecast iceberg drift paths under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Drifting icebergs in the polar oceans play a key role in the Earth's climate system, impacting freshwater fluxes into the ocean and regional ecosystems while also posing a challenge to polar navigation. However, accurately forecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of iceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg motion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a highly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These limitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture the underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep learning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift physics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the pattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth observations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network that captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future iceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with state-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings demonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety of time points. These results highlight IDRIFTNET's effectiveness in capturing the complex, nonlinear drift of icebergs for forecasting iceberg trajectories under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.

Summary:
The article introduces novel neuron-centric algorithms for model fusion in neural networks. These algorithms effectively integrate multiple trained models into a single network, overcoming challenges such as differences in internal representations and training data distribution. The approach groups intermediate neurons of parent models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with its corresponding sub-network, taking into account neuron attribution scores. Unlike previous techniques, these algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing fusion methods, particularly in scenarios with zero-shot and non-IID fusion. The code for implementing the algorithms is available on GitHub for reference. <div>

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents. However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel, neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore, our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID fusion scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Data reduction, Pointwise V-information, Classifier performance, Progressive learning, Cross-lingual

Summary:
Data reduction is crucial for enhancing efficiency in data-centric AI by selecting the most informative instances within large datasets. This paper introduces a data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-information (PVI) to identify optimal instances for improving data quality and training efficiency. By quantifying instance difficulty with PVI, low-difficulty instances are filtered out, leading to a static approach that preserves classifier performance while removing 10%-30% of the data. Using a progressive learning approach on instances sorted by ascending PVI accelerates convergence and results in a 0.8% accuracy gain compared to conventional training. The PVI framework, initially designed for English datasets, is successfully applied to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, providing insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach. Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training.

Summary: 
Graph classification is important in various fields, with explainable methods focusing on patterns. This study compares 38 quality measures for pattern evaluation, considering mathematical properties. A benchmark dataset is used to create a gold standard ranking for patterns, leading to an empirical comparison of measures in terms of ranking and classification performance. A clustering-based preprocessing step is proposed to group patterns from the same graphs, improving classification performance by reducing the number of patterns processed while maintaining performance. Popular measures commonly used in the literature are shown to not always yield the best results. <div>
arXiv:2507.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task, those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the best results.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new framework called LightweightSER (LiSER) for speech emotion recognition (SER) in voice interfaces. LiSER utilizes unlabeled audio-visual data and large teacher models to transfer knowledge for SER tasks. By leveraging advanced speech and face representation models, LiSER reduces the dependency on extensive labeled datasets. Experiments conducted on RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets show the effectiveness of LiSER in recognizing emotions through speech and facial expressions. This approach highlights the importance of incorporating multi-modal cues in SER systems and the potential of knowledge distillation in enhancing model performance. <div>
arXiv:2507.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However, collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER (LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

Summary:
Smooth-Distill is a novel self-distillation framework that combines human activity recognition and sensor placement detection using wearable sensor data. It utilizes a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, to process accelerometer data and achieve both tasks. The framework uses a historical version of the model as the teacher, reducing training computational overhead while maintaining performance benefits. A comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset was developed to support the research, capturing 12 sleep postures across different wearing positions. Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill outperforms alternative approaches in both tasks, demonstrating improved stability in training convergence patterns and reduced overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This method enhances the practical implementation of knowledge distillation in human activity recognition systems, offering a balance between accuracy and training efficiency while reducing computational costs. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training, which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on resource-constrained platforms.

Summary: <br /> 
Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG) proposes a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates fractional calculus to optimize policies while accounting for long-term temporal dependencies. By using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes power-law correlations between state transitions, allowing for more efficient sampling and variance reduction compared to traditional policy gradient methods. The framework also introduces a recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference errors, which achieves variance reduction of O(t^(-alpha)) and maintains convergence. Empirical validation demonstrates that FPG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of sample efficiency and variance reduction, showing gains of 35-68% and 24-52%, respectively. Overall, FPG offers a mathematically grounded approach to improving policy optimization by leveraging long-range dependencies without incurring additional computational overhead. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We propose Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning framework incorporating fractional calculus for long-term temporal modeling in policy optimization. Standard policy gradient approaches face limitations from Markovian assumptions, exhibiting high variance and inefficient sampling. By reformulating gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes power-law temporal correlations between state transitions. We develop an efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference errors with constant time and memory requirements. Theoretical analysis shows FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction of order O(t^(-alpha)) versus standard policy gradients while preserving convergence. Empirical validation demonstrates 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction versus state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides a mathematically grounded approach for leveraging long-range dependencies without computational overhead.

<div> self-improvement, large language models, training dynamics, solver-verifier gap, performance prediction

Summary:
The paper explores the training dynamics of self-improvement in large language models (LLM) by introducing the concept of solver-verifier gap. It theorizes that the performance enhancement of self-improvement is based on the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. The authors propose a method to predict the ultimate power of self-improvement using information from the initial training epochs. Empirical validation on various LLMs and datasets confirms the effectiveness of the theoretical model. The study extends to analyze how external data influences the dynamics, showing that under limited external data regimes, such data can be utilized at any stage without significantly impacting final performances, aligning with empirical observations. This research sheds light on the evolution of LLM performances during self-improvement and provides insights into the role of external data in enhancing model capabilities.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

<div> Keywords: time series foundation models, representation learning, generalization, cross-domain transfer, theoretical analysis

Summary:
Time series foundation models have been developed using the paradigm of training large language models on vast datasets. Despite the distinct nature of time series data, these models have shown remarkable success in generalization and cross-domain transferability. This paper delves into the representation learning mechanisms of patch-based time series models and argues that they extend deterministic vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that time-series patches can be quantized into a discrete vocabulary, similar to natural language, allowing for robust representation and transfer abilities. This insight provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding and enhancing the performance of large-scale time series foundation models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However, this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox, this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation models.

arXiv:2507.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM, a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution, enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries. Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations, particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN), a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies. Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 + COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost), achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5 percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.

Experimental results show that GFEN outperforms current methods by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and achieves faster convergence rates, highlighting its potential to enhance traffic prediction system efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system efficiency.

arXiv:2507.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open, zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets, particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a 300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion coverage. These results establish a unified, scalable deep learning framework for proteomic analysis, offering improved sensitivity, modification coverage, and interpretability.

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework for short-term occupational accident forecasting using safety inspections and binary time series models. Daily predictions are aggregated into weekly safety assessments to support decision-making. A sliding-window cross-validation procedure is applied for time series data evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms are compared, with the long short-term memory (LSTM) network showing the best performance in detecting high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86. This methodology demonstrates the ability to anticipate critical periods based on safety inspections and convert routine data into clear weekly risk scores. Decision-makers can use these scores to prioritize inspections, schedule interventions, and allocate resources effectively to prevent accidents before they occur, maximizing the return on safety investments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and getting the greatest return on safety investments.

<div> Keywords: resource allocation, firefighter interventions, data generation, synthetic data quality, unbalanced distribution 

Summary: <br /><br />Allocation of personnel and material resources for firefighter interventions is crucial for optimizing response. This study evaluates different methods for generating synthetic data to simulate various scenarios. Traditional metrics may not fully capture the nuances of real-world firefighting data, so domain-specific metrics are used to assess data quality. These metrics include evaluating response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and representation of accidents. The highly unbalanced distribution and complex correlations in the data present challenges for data generation. Various methods, such as Random Sampling, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks, are examined for their effectiveness in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. This comprehensive evaluation helps determine the most suitable method for generating synthetic data for realistic firefighting scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Summary: 
DFReg is a new regularization method for deep neural networks inspired by physics principles. It applies a functional penalty based on Density Functional Theory to promote smooth, diverse, and well-distributed weight configurations globally. Unlike traditional techniques like Dropout or L2 decay, DFReg does not require changes to the network architecture or introduce stochastic perturbations. Instead, it enforces global structural regularity, enhancing the overall performance and generalization of deep neural networks. <div>

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial, particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in industrial quality control.

Summary:  
- The research explores using diffusion models for text-to-level generation, a less explored area compared to tile-based game levels.  
- Strategies are presented to automatically assign descriptive captions to existing level datasets and train diffusion models using pretrained text encoders or simple transformer models.  
- Comparisons are made with unconditional diffusion models, generative adversarial networks, and other text-to-level approaches like Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from 162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

Summary:<br />
This thesis focuses on theoretical insights into local update algorithms, particularly Local SGD, within distributed and federated optimization frameworks considering realistic data heterogeneity. It highlights the bounded second-order heterogeneity assumption as essential for the superiority of local updates over centralized or mini-batch methods in both convex and non-convex scenarios. Tight upper and lower bounds are established for various local update algorithms across different regimes, with the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes characterized. The analysis framework, based on consensus error, leads to more precise finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends its findings to online federated learning, presenting fundamental regret bounds under first-order and bandit feedback. These results offer clarity on the advantages of local updates, serving as a comprehensive reference for assessing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L (0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications, the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability. Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings, standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

<div> Keywords: Data heterogeneity, Federated learning, Personalized federated learning, Adaptive collaboration, FEDMOSAIC <br />
Summary: 
Federated learning faces challenges due to data heterogeneity, with personalized federated learning (PFL) aiming to address this by tailoring models to each client's distribution. However, many PFL methods do not perform better than local or centralized baselines. A new approach of adaptive collaboration is proposed, where clients make adaptive decisions on how much to rely on others and whom to trust at the individual example level. FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method, is introduced where clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset to enable fine-grained trust decisions. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on private and public data agreement and contributes to global pseudo-labels based on per-example confidence. Empirical results show FEDMOSAIC outperforming state-of-the-art PFL methods in diverse non-IID settings, with convergence guarantees provided under standard assumptions. This highlights the potential of data-aware collaboration for robust and effective personalization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence. Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration for robust and effective personalization.

<div> reject relations, stimulus equivalence, computational models, neural networks, associative learning  
Summary:  
Reject relations were found to impact the performance of artificial neural networks in simulations of stimulus equivalence. The study compared feedforward neural networks, BERT, and GPT models in various training conditions and found that while some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence tests, their performance was comparable to a benchmark probabilistic agent. This suggests that artificial neural networks may rely on associative learning strategies rather than forming equivalence classes. The study highlights the importance of considering reject relations and implementing stricter criteria in computational models of equivalence. <div>
arXiv:2507.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE), yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS) simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series, one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational models of equivalence.

<br />
Summary: 
Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL) is proposed as an adaptation of Double Q-learning for value-based deep reinforcement learning. DDQL addresses overestimation issues observed in Q-learning by training two Q-functions that bootstrap off each other. In comparison to Double DQN, DDQL demonstrates reduced overestimation and superior performance across 57 Atari 2600 games without the need for additional hyperparameters. The study also explores various aspects of DDQL such as network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy to optimize its performance. DDQL offers a promising approach to mitigating overestimation in deep RL algorithms, providing a more reliable method for action-selection and evaluation in bootstrap targets. <div>

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets. Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks (DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN. However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

Summary:<br />
This work introduces a structure-preserving machine learning method called Lift & Learn for creating reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. The method utilizes lifting variable transformations to learn a quadratic lifted system with quadratic energy via an energy quadratization strategy. The lifted dynamics are linear in the original variables, simplifying model learning. By analytically deriving quadratic reduced terms and formulating a constrained optimization problem, the method learns the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving manner. Three numerical examples demonstrate the method's generalizability, showing competitive accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing data-driven model reduction techniques. <div>

Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift & Learn, a scientific machine learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's adaptability and stability in complex network environments.

<title>Open-ended Scientific Discovery via Bayesian Surprise</title>

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses, our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM. Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward towards building open-ended ASD systems.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints, and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization (DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited data for RRG tasks.

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances. Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

<title>Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>

arXiv:2507.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.

<title>MoNE: Replacing Redundant Experts with Lightweight Novices for Structured Pruning of MoE</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models by activating only a subset of experts per input token. However, deploying MoE-based models incurs significant memory overhead due to the need to retain all experts in memory. While structured pruning is promising to reduce memory costs, existing methods often show suboptimal performance and unstable degradation in three dimensions: model architectures, calibration data sources, and calibration sample sizes. This paper proposes Mixture-of-Novices-and-Experts (MoNE), a novel expert pruning method that replaces redundant experts with lightweight novices to achieve effective and robust model compression. MoNE evaluates expert redundancy based on two metrics: access frequency and output variance. Experts exhibiting low usage and stable outputs are pruned and replaced with lightweight novices-unbiased estimations of their original outputs-minimizing performance degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE consistently outperforms baseline methods with minimal accuracy degradation across the three dimensions, confirming its effectiveness and robustness. Notably, it improves the average zero shot accuracy across nine downstream tasks by up to 2.71 under 25\% pruning ratio and 3.61 under 50\% pruning.

Abstract: As transformer sequence lengths grow, existing pipeline parallelisms incur suboptimal performance due to the quadratic attention computation and the substantial memory overhead. To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe, a novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First, HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention computations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in parallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold first-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap communication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation without attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer sequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages with longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput and scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster configurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\% speedup over baseline methods when training a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs. Code is available at https://github.com/code-tunnel/Megatron-LM/tree/dev.

<title>Diffusion Disambiguation Models for Partial Label Learning</title>

Abstract: Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning} (PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process. Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling. Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations. This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked, alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings, while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR); to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

<title>Overcoming Long-Context Limitations of State-Space Models via Context-Dependent Sparse Attention</title>

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a model to recall a value associated with a single key without context, insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling. To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention (CISA).

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

Abstract: We present a Transformer architecture for long-context language modeling that combines global attention with two biologically inspired components: chunked local attention and a gated FIFO memory mechanism. This unified attention block allows the model to efficiently handle both short-range and long-range dependencies without increasing attention cost quadratically. The memory module persistently stores past token representations using a gated update mechanism inspired by recurrent networks. Rotary positional encoding is applied per attention head to enable directionally disentangled, scale-invariant positional signals. The architecture is implemented entirely from scratch in PyTorch, with no reliance on high-level libraries, enabling transparent and modular experimentation. Our model offers a lightweight and extensible design for tasks such as dialogue modeling, code completion, and document understanding.

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees. The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets, including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints is a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. These problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to hard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have been developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of dimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a promising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from poor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the target distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new framework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages. First, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and surrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection problem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising candidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints. During posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly multi-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when constraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate this issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the latent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data space. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/umkiyoung/CiBO}{here}.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions. First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of such attacks.

<title>Exploring Large Action Sets with Hyperspherical Embeddings using von Mises-Fisher Sampling</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces von Mises-Fisher exploration (vMF-exp), a scalable method for exploring large action sets in reinforcement learning problems where hyperspherical embedding vectors represent these actions. vMF-exp involves initially sampling a state embedding representation using a von Mises-Fisher distribution, then exploring this representation's nearest neighbors, which scales to virtually unlimited numbers of candidate actions. We show that, under theoretical assumptions, vMF-exp asymptotically maintains the same probability of exploring each action as Boltzmann Exploration (B-exp), a popular alternative that, nonetheless, suffers from scalability issues as it requires computing softmax values for each action. Consequently, vMF-exp serves as a scalable alternative to B-exp for exploring large action sets with hyperspherical embeddings. Experiments on simulated data, real-world public data, and the successful large-scale deployment of vMF-exp on the recommender system of a global music streaming service empirically validate the key properties of the proposed method.

Abstract: Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search (QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its effectiveness and practical utility.

<title>Residual Reward Models for Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network, using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at https://sunlighted.github.io/RRM-web/.

Abstract: Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum description length, which are associated with flat minima and good generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

<title>Cognitive Load-Aware Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Optimizing the Token Economy of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment. While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$, and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem ($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29% decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine the user position on Earth.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general, non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while maintaining sample diversity and visual quality. This work contributes to advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models, enabling a broader range of classifiers to be used as guidance classifiers.

<title>A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability</title>

arXiv:2507.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides. Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based approach to certifying stability in control theory.

<title>SCAWaveNet: A Spatial-Channel Attention-based Network for Global Significant Wave Height Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2507.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spaceborne GNSS missions have produced extensive global datasets, providing a robust basis for deep learning-based significant wave height (SWH) retrieval. While existing deep learning models predominantly utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC buoy observations. The code is available at https://github.com/Clifx9908/SCAWaveNet.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have recently achieved impressive results on reasoning benchmarks. Yet, growing evidence shows that these models often generate longer but ineffective chains of thought (CoTs), calling into question whether benchmark gains reflect real reasoning improvements. We present new evidence of overthinking, where models disregard correct solutions even when explicitly provided, instead continuing to generate unnecessary reasoning steps that often lead to incorrect conclusions. Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024 math benchmark reveal critical limitations in these models ability to integrate corrective information, posing new challenges for achieving robust and interpretable reasoning.

<title>Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty Measures for Ordinal Classification through Binary Reduction</title>

Abstract: Ordinal classification problems, where labels exhibit a natural order, are prevalent in high-stakes fields such as medicine and finance. Accurate uncertainty quantification, including the decomposition into aleatoric (inherent variability) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) components, is crucial for reliable decision-making. However, existing research has primarily focused on nominal classification and regression. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal classification, which is based on a suitable reduction to (entropy- and variance-based) measures for the binary case. These measures effectively capture the trade-off in ordinal classification between exact hit-rate and minimial error distances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various tabular ordinal benchmark datasets using ensembles of gradient-boosted trees and multi-layer perceptrons for approximate Bayesian inference. Our method significantly outperforms standard and label-wise entropy and variance-based measures in error detection, as indicated by misclassification rates and mean absolute error. Additionally, the ordinal measures show competitive performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the ordinal nature of classification problems when assessing uncertainty.

<title>Ordinality in Discrete-level Question Difficulty Estimation: Introducing Balanced DRPS and OrderedLogitNN</title>

arXiv:2507.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation (QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs -- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

Abstract: Computer manufacturers offer platforms for users to describe device faults using textual reports such as "My screen is flickering". Identifying the faulty component from the report is essential for automating tests and improving user experience. However, such reports are often ambiguous and lack detail, making this task challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in addressing such issues. This study evaluates 27 open-source models (1B-72B parameters) and 2 proprietary LLMs using four prompting strategies: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and CoT+Few-Shot (CoT+FS). We conducted 98,948 inferences, processing over 51 million input tokens and generating 13 million output tokens. We achieve f1-score up to 0.76. Results show that three models offer the best balance between size and performance: mistral-small-24b-instruct and two smaller models, llama-3.2-1b-instruct and gemma-2-2b-it, that offer competitive performance with lower VRAM usage, enabling efficient inference on end-user devices as modern laptops or smartphones with NPUs.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, computers can now simulate realistic and complex natural processes. We apply this capability to predict how wildfires spread, a task made difficult by the unpredictable nature of fire and the variety of environmental conditions it depends on. In this study, We present the first denoising diffusion model for predicting wildfire spread, a new kind of AI framework that learns to simulate fires not just as one fixed outcome, but as a range of possible scenarios. By doing so, it accounts for the inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics, a feature that traditional models typically fail to represent. Unlike deterministic approaches that generate a single prediction, our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. This technology could help us develop smarter, faster, and more reliable tools for anticipating wildfire behavior, aiding decision-makers in fire risk assessment and response planning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in certain real-world industrial applications, yet its broader deployment remains limited by inherent challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable learning dynamics. This study investigates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) as a mechanism for improving RL performance in an industrially inspired sorting environment. We propose a novel approach in which GA-generated expert demonstrations are used to enhance policy learning. These demonstrations are incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based learning and utilized as warm-start trajectories for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and enables further research into adaptive RL strategies for real-world applications.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules. Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function. On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.

Abstract: HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced computation for accurate cluster detection and forecasting. We employed quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved 92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart. Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways. This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for PrEP, and address structural inequities fueling HIV transmission.

Abstract: Many of the observations we make are biased by our decisions. For instance, the demand of items is impacted by the prices set, and online checkout choices are influenced by the assortments presented. The challenge in decision-making under this setting is the lack of counterfactual information, and the need to learn it instead. We introduce an end-to-end method under endogenous uncertainty to train ML models to be aware of their downstream, enabling their effective use in the decision-making stage. We further introduce a robust optimization variant that accounts for uncertainty in ML models -- specifically by constructing uncertainty sets over the space of ML models and optimizing actions to protect against worst-case predictions. We prove guarantees that this robust approach can capture near-optimal decisions with high probability as a function of data. Besides this, we also introduce a new class of two-stage stochastic optimization problems to the end-to-end learning framework that can now be addressed through our framework. Here, the first stage is an information-gathering problem to decide which random variable to poll and gain information about before making a second-stage decision based off of it. We present several computational experiments for pricing and inventory assortment/recommendation problems. We compare against existing methods in online learning/bandits/offline reinforcement learning and show our approach has consistent improved performance over these. Just as in the endogenous setting, the model's prediction also depends on the first-stage decision made. While this decision does not affect the random variable in this setting, it does affect the correct point forecast that should be made.

<title>Machine Learning-based Early Detection of Potato Sprouting Using Electrophysiological Signals</title>

Abstract: Accurately predicting potato sprouting before the emergence of any visual signs is critical for effective storage management, as sprouting degrades both the commercial and nutritional value of tubers. Effective forecasting allows for the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing waste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the ban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to health and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of significantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily rely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological changes have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A reliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely intervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies, where early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In this work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To this end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables early prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals recorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the recorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and trains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection of potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a subset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all potatoes. Despite promising results, further refinements are necessary to minimize prediction errors, particularly in reducing the maximum observed deviations.

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However, each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for 3D molecular generation are based on significant inductive biases, SE(3), permutation equivariance to respect symmetry and graph message-passing networks to capture local chemistry, yet the generated molecules still struggle with physical plausibility. We introduce TABASCO which relaxes these assumptions: The model has a standard non-equivariant transformer architecture, treats atoms in a molecule as sequences and reconstructs bonds deterministically after generation. The absence of equivariant layers and message passing allows us to significantly simplify the model architecture and scale data throughput. On the GEOM-Drugs benchmark TABASCO achieves state-of-the-art PoseBusters validity and delivers inference roughly 10x faster than the strongest baseline, while exhibiting emergent rotational equivariance despite symmetry not being hard-coded. Our work offers a blueprint for training minimalist, high-throughput generative models suited to specialised tasks such as structure- and pharmacophore-based drug design. We provide a link to our implementation at github.com/carlosinator/tabasco.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Quantized Federated Learning with Diverse Precision</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC) and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task. In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

Abstract: Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of time series foundation models (TSFMs) for crowd flow prediction, focusing on Moirai and TimesFM. Evaluated on three real-world mobility datasets-Bike NYC, Taxi Beijing, and Spanish national OD flows-these models are deployed in a strict zero-shot setting, using only the temporal evolution of each OD flow and no explicit spatial information. Moirai and TimesFM outperform both statistical and deep learning baselines, achieving up to 33% lower RMSE, 39% lower MAE and up to 49% higher CPC compared to state-of-the-art competitors. Our results highlight the practical value of TSFMs for accurate, scalable flow prediction, even in scenarios with limited annotated data or missing spatial context.

Abstract: The Discovery Engine is a general purpose automated system for scientific discovery, which combines machine learning with state-of-the-art ML interpretability to enable rapid and robust scientific insight across diverse datasets. In this paper, we benchmark the Discovery Engine against five recent peer-reviewed scientific publications applying machine learning across medicine, materials science, social science, and environmental science. In each case, the Discovery Engine matches or exceeds prior predictive performance while also generating deeper, more actionable insights through rich interpretability artefacts. These results demonstrate its potential as a new standard for automated, interpretable scientific modelling that enables complex knowledge discovery from data.

<title>Scalable Feature Learning on Huge Knowledge Graphs for Downstream Machine Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large knowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to distill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream applications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations: they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive learning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.01003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

<title>ZeCO: Zero Communication Overhead Sequence Parallelism for Linear Attention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01004</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead) sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an 16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead. Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on 256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\% speedup compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a clear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously intractable sequence lengths.

Abstract: We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture, image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly. Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects: best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods. The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab work, adaptable to scientific disciplines.

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training. Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured (tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for personalized learning at scale.

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset, involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks.

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however, other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis, it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach (KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds, out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]), outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978]) and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine learning models that automatically update as additional data become available. New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential optimization.

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over 54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR (ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable performance on the other three datasets.

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses, limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations (responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation processes.

<title>Estimating Correctness Without Oracles in LLM-Based Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate: LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence, that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation. In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75 unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction. Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance. Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity, including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic. Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge. Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9% to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time sign language recognition using lightweight DNNs trained on limited data. Our system addresses key challenges in sign language recognition, including data scarcity, high computational costs, and discrepancies in frame rates between training and inference environments. By encoding sign language specific parameters, such as handshape, palm orientation, movement, and location into vectorized inputs, and leveraging MediaPipe for landmark extraction, we achieve highly separable input data representations. Our DNN architecture, optimized for sub 10MB deployment, enables accurate classification of 343 signs with less than 10ms latency on edge devices. The data annotation platform 'slait data' facilitates structured labeling and vector extraction. Our model achieved 92% accuracy in isolated sign recognition and has been integrated into the 'slait ai' web application, where it demonstrates stable inference.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature importance quantification faces a fundamental challenge: when predictors are correlated, standard methods systematically underestimate their contributions. We prove that major existing approaches target identical population functionals under squared-error loss, revealing why they share this correlation-induced bias.
  To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Disentangled Feature Importance (DFI)}, a nonparametric generalization of the classical $R^2$ decomposition via optimal transport. DFI transforms correlated features into independent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation distortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed back through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled decomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability for latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA variances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.
  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general transport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of importance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original feature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve second-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and transport map estimation errors are $o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$. By design, DFI avoids the computational burden of repeated submodel refitting and the challenges of conditional covariate distribution estimation, thereby achieving computational efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization. This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem, as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally, the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with pretrained embeddings.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of statistically extracting generative factors from complex, high-dimensional datasets in unsupervised or semi-supervised settings. We investigate encoder-decoder-based generative models for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, focusing on disentangling low-dimensional latent variables corresponding to independent physical factors. Introducing Aux-VAE, a novel architecture within the classical Variational Autoencoder framework, we achieve disentanglement with minimal modifications to the standard VAE loss function by leveraging prior statistical knowledge through auxiliary variables. These variables guide the shaping of the latent space by aligning latent factors with learned auxiliary variables. We validate the efficacy of Aux-VAE through comparative assessments on multiple datasets, including astronomical simulations.

Abstract: Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and stability selection, respectively.

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible -- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head", akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

Abstract: Differential privacy is a well-established framework for safeguarding sensitive information in data. While extensively applied across various domains, its application to network data -- particularly at the node level -- remains underexplored. Existing methods for node-level privacy either focus exclusively on query-based approaches, which restrict output to pre-specified network statistics, or fail to preserve key structural properties of the network. In this work, we propose GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node Differential privacy), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first network release mechanism that releases entire networks while ensuring node-level differential privacy and preserving structural properties. Under a broad class of latent space models, we show that the released network asymptotically follows the same distribution as the original network. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global machine learning model with coordination from a central server, without needing to share their raw data. This approach is particularly appealing in the era of privacy regulations like the GDPR, leading many prominent companies to adopt it. However, FL's distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients, controlled by an attacker, send harmful data to compromise the model. Most existing poisoning attacks in FL aim to degrade the model's integrity, such as reducing its accuracy, with limited attention to privacy concerns from these attacks. In this study, we introduce FedPoisonMIA, a novel poisoning membership inference attack targeting FL. FedPoisonMIA involves malicious clients crafting local model updates to infer membership information. Additionally, we propose a robust defense mechanism to mitigate the impact of FedPoisonMIA attacks. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, while our defense approach reduces its impact to a degree.

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle, demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns. Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells, highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the VMSE U-Net and VM-Unet CBAM+ model, two cutting-edge deep learning architectures designed to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) techniques into the traditional VM U-Net framework, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, feature localization, and computational efficiency. Both models show superior performance compared to the baseline VM-Unet across multiple datasets.

<title>Not All Attention Heads Are What You Need: Refining CLIP's Image Representation with Attention Ablation</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method, called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models with virtually no increase in inference cost.

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: Understanding the functional roles of financial institutions within interconnected markets is critical for effective supervision, systemic risk assessment, and resolution planning. We propose an interpretable role-based clustering approach for multi-layer financial networks, designed to identify the functional positions of institutions across different market segments. Our method follows a general clustering framework defined by proximity measures, cluster evaluation criteria, and algorithm selection. We construct explainable node embeddings based on egonet features that capture both direct and indirect trading relationships within and across market layers. Using transaction-level data from the ECB's Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR), we demonstrate how the approach uncovers heterogeneous institutional roles such as market intermediaries, cross-segment connectors, and peripheral lenders or borrowers. The results highlight the flexibility and practical value of role-based clustering in analyzing financial networks and understanding institutional behavior in complex market structures.

Abstract: Approximating complex probability distributions, such as Bayesian posterior distributions, is of central interest in many applications. We study the expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations. These consist of approximations by Gaussian pushforwards through diffeomorphisms or Riemannian exponential maps. We first review these two different kinds of geometric Gaussian approximations. Then we explore their relationship to one another. We further provide a constructive proof that such geometric Gaussian approximations are universal, in that they can capture any probability distribution. Finally, we discuss whether, given a family of probability distributions, a common diffeomorphism can be found to obtain uniformly high-quality geometric Gaussian approximations for that family.

<title>Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting</title>

Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (SBP), which is central to entropic optimal transport. For general reference processes and begin--endpoint distributions, we propose a forward-reverse iterative Monte Carlo procedure to approximate the Schr\"odinger potentials in a nonparametric way. In particular, we use kernel based Monte Carlo regression in the context of Picard iteration of a corresponding fixed point problem. By preserving in the iteration positivity and contractivity in a Hilbert metric sense, we develop a provably convergent algorithm. Furthermore, we provide convergence rates for the potential estimates and prove their optimality. Finally, as an application, we propose a non-nested Monte Carlo procedure for the final dimensional distributions of the Schr\"odinger Bridge process, based on the constructed potentials and the forward-reverse simulation method for conditional diffusions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches in physics rely on global optimization, limiting interpretability and enforcing physical constraints externally. We introduce the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a self-organizing computational framework in which learning emerges from local Hebbian updates driven by violations of conservation laws. Grounded in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and inspired by Prigogine/'s theory of dissipative structures, HPNs eliminate the need for global loss functions by encoding physical laws directly into the system/'s local dynamics. Residuals - quantified imbalances in continuity, momentum, or energy - serve as thermodynamic signals that drive weight adaptation through generalized Hebbian plasticity. We demonstrate this approach on incompressible fluid flow and continuum diffusion, where physically consistent structures emerge from random initial conditions without supervision. HPNs reframe computation as a residual-driven thermodynamic process, offering an interpretable, scalable, and physically grounded alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Sampling algorithms drive probabilistic machine learning, and recent years have seen an explosion in the diversity of tools for this task. However, the increasing sophistication of sampling algorithms is correlated with an increase in the tuning burden. There is now a greater need than ever to treat the tuning of samplers as a learning task in its own right. In a conceptual breakthrough, Wang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process, opening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical benefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for subsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the surprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate, or the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training RLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence, whose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we explore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that balance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the associated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb benchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH.

Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic \textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable, physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter physics and AI.

<title>Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>

Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra. Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in geophysical inverse problems.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective method to learn interpretable models of dynamical systems from data. However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression problem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned. Although, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying slow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables have to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate terms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy library. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow manifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of the slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables restricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is leveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains only essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than containing all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom library is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific problem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a snap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that our method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the SINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow manifolds.

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts. By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia, with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs (GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods (Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models (decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine- from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to nowcasting performance.

Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift estimation is critical for observational cosmology, especially in large-scale surveys where spectroscopic measurements are impractical. Traditional approaches include template fitting and machine learning, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We present a hybrid method that integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided neural networks. By embedding spectral energy distribution templates into the network architecture, our model encodes physical priors into the training process. The system employs a multimodal design, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse photometric and image data, along with Bayesian layers for uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our model on the publicly available PREML dataset, which includes approximately 400,000 galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam PDR3 release, with 5-band photometry, multi-band imaging, and spectroscopic redshifts. Our approach achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, a 3-sigma catastrophic outlier rate of 0.13%, and a bias of 0.0028. The model satisfies two of the three LSST photometric redshift requirements for redshifts below 3. These results highlight the potential of combining physically motivated templates with data-driven models for robust redshift estimation in upcoming cosmological surveys.

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend. Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling behavior deviates from linear trends.

Abstract: Due to its invariance to rigid transformations such as rotations and reflections, Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) was introduced in the literature as an optimal transport (OT) distance, alternative to Wasserstein and more suited to tasks such as the alignment and comparison of point clouds. Having that application in mind, we carefully build a space of discrete probability measures and show that over that space PW actually is a distance. Algorithms to solve the PW problems already exist, however we extend the PW framework by discussing and testing several initialization strategies. We then introduce the notion of PW barycenter and detail an algorithm to estimate it from the data. The result is a new method to compute representative shapes from a collection of point clouds. We benchmark our method against existing OT approaches, demonstrating superior performance in scenarios requiring precise alignment and shape preservation. We finally show the usefulness of the PW barycenters in an archaeological context. Our results highlight the potential of PW in boosting 2D and 3D point cloud analysis for machine learning and computational geometry applications.

Abstract: Social media popularity prediction plays a crucial role in content optimization, marketing strategies, and user engagement enhancement across digital platforms. However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture inter-modal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperFusion achieves competitive performance on the SMP challenge dataset. Our team achieved third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track).

However, existing lidar and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources. We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for low-cost indoor mobile robots.

Abstract: Social media platforms serve as central hubs for content dissemination, opinion expression, and public engagement across diverse modalities. Accurately predicting the popularity of social media videos enables valuable applications in content recommendation, trend detection, and audience engagement. In this paper, we present Multimodal Video Predictor (MVP), our winning solution to the Video Track of the SMP Challenge 2025. MVP constructs expressive post representations by integrating deep video features extracted from pretrained models with user metadata and contextual information. The framework applies systematic preprocessing techniques, including log-transformations and outlier removal, to improve model robustness. A gradient-boosted regression model is trained to capture complex patterns across modalities. Our approach ranked first in the official evaluation of the Video Track, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability for multimodal video popularity prediction on social platforms.

Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics. Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO 2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of magnitude larger than any empirical set of >T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of known UCDs with object classification metrics >99% and an average spectral type precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5 degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from photometric catalogs.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Abstract: Modern warehouse automation systems rely on fleets of intelligent robots that generate vast amounts of data -- most of which remains unannotated. This paper develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages real-world, unlabeled data to improve perception models without requiring manual annotations. Our work focuses specifically on estimating the pose and shape of boxes and presents a correct-and-certify pipeline for self-supervised box pose and shape estimation. We extensively evaluate our approach across a range of simulated and real industrial settings, including adaptation to a large-scale real-world dataset of 50,000 images. The self-supervised model significantly outperforms models trained solely in simulation and shows substantial improvements over a zero-shot 3D bounding box estimation baseline.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities.

<title>Junk DNA Hypothesis: Pruning Small Pre-Trained Weights Irreversibly and Monotonically Impairs "Difficult" Downstream Tasks in LLMs</title>

Abstract: We present Junk DNA Hypothesis by adopting a novel task-centric angle for the pre-trained weights of large language models (LLMs). It has been believed that weights in LLMs contain significant redundancy, leading to the conception that a considerable chunk of the parameters can be removed by pruning without compromising performance. Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a counter-argument: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode vital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested as the monotonic relationship between the performance drop of downstream tasks across the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by magnitude. Moreover, we reveal that these seemingly inconsequential weights can result in irreparable loss of knowledge and performance degradation in difficult tasks, even when downstream continual training is allowed. Interestingly, our evaluations show that the other popular compression, namely quantization, fails to exhibit similar monotonic effect and does not as convincingly disentangle this task-difficulty information. To study formally, we introduce several quantifiable metrics to gauge the downstream task difficulty: (1) within the same task category, and (2) across different task categories. Our extensive experiments substantiate the Junk DNA Hypothesis across a diverse range of model sizes, tasks, datasets, and even pruning methods.

<title>Outlier Weighed Layerwise Sparsity (OWL): A Missing Secret Sauce for Pruning LLMs to High Sparsity</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), renowned for their remarkable performance across diverse domains, present a challenge when it comes to practical deployment due to their colossal model size. In response to this challenge, efforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network pruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can be pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning strategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all layers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this observation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field of vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields stronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we conduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the emergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we introduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of non-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise sparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio observed within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between layerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation, conducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks, demonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For instance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the state-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by 61.22 and 6.80 perplexity at a high sparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering 2.6x end-to-end inference speed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine.

<title>Identifying the Truth of Global Model: A Generic Solution to Defend Against Byzantine and Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning (full version)</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, the federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such \textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate contributions from these underrepresented datasets.
  In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.

<title>Soft Dice Confidence: A Near-Optimal Confidence Estimator for Selective Prediction in Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Selective prediction augments a model with the option to abstain from providing unreliable predictions. The key ingredient is a confidence score function, which should be directly related to the conditional risk. In the case of binary semantic segmentation, existing score functions either ignore the particularities of the evaluation metric or demand additional held-out data for tuning. We propose the Soft Dice Confidence (SDC), a simple, tuning-free confidence score function that directly aligns with the Dice coefficient metric. We prove that, under conditional independence, the SDC is near optimal: we establish upper and lower bounds on the ratio between the SDC and the ideal (intractable) confidence score function and show that these bounds are very close to 1. Experiments on six public medical-imaging benchmarks and on synthetic data corroborate our theoretical findings. In fact, SDC outperformed all prior confidence estimators from the literature in all of our experiments, including those that rely on additional data. These results position SDC as a reliable and efficient confidence estimator for selective prediction in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents a convolutional neural network model for precipitation nowcasting that combines data-driven learning with physics-informed domain knowledge. We propose LUPIN, a Lagrangian Double U-Net for Physics-Informed Nowcasting, that draws from existing extrapolation-based nowcasting methods. It consists of a U-Net that dynamically produces mesoscale advection motion fields, a differentiable semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an advection-free U-Net capturing the growth and decay of precipitation over time. Using our approach, we successfully implement the Lagrangian convolutional neural network for precipitation nowcasting in a fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated manner. This allows for end-to-end training and inference, including the data-driven Lagrangian coordinate system transformation of the data at runtime. We evaluate the model and compare it with other related AI-based models both quantitatively and qualitatively in an extreme event case study. Based on our evaluation, LUPIN matches and even exceeds the performance of the chosen benchmarks, opening the door for other Lagrangian machine learning models.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large foundation models, leveraging low-rank matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to represent weight changes (i.e., $\Delta \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}$). This method reduces trainable parameters and mitigates heavy memory consumption associated with full delta matrices by sequentially multiplying $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with the activation. Despite its success, the intrinsic low-rank characteristic may limit its performance. Although several variants have been proposed to address this issue, they often overlook the crucial computational and memory efficiency brought by LoRA. In this paper, we propose Circular Convolution Adaptation (C$^3$A), which not only achieves high-rank adaptation with enhanced performance but also excels in both computational power and memory utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^3$A consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across various fine-tuning tasks.

Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with error probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.

Abstract: The general-utility Markov decision processes (GUMDPs) framework generalizes the MDPs framework by considering objective functions that depend on the frequency of visitation of state-action pairs induced by a given policy. In this work, we contribute with the first analysis on the impact of the number of trials, i.e., the number of randomly sampled trajectories, in infinite-horizon GUMDPs. We show that, as opposed to standard MDPs, the number of trials plays a key-role in infinite-horizon GUMDPs and the expected performance of a given policy depends, in general, on the number of trials. We consider both discounted and average GUMDPs, where the objective function depends, respectively, on discounted and average frequencies of visitation of state-action pairs. First, we study policy evaluation under discounted GUMDPs, proving lower and upper bounds on the mismatch between the finite and infinite trials formulations for GUMDPs. Second, we address average GUMDPs, studying how different classes of GUMDPs impact the mismatch between the finite and infinite trials formulations. Third, we provide a set of empirical results to support our claims, highlighting how the number of trajectories and the structure of the underlying GUMDP influence policy evaluation.

Abstract: Effective visual representation learning is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to extract task-relevant information from raw sensory inputs and generalize across diverse environments. However, existing RL benchmarks lack the ability to systematically evaluate representation learning capabilities in isolation from other learning challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), a novel benchmark that transforms the classic 8-tile puzzle into a visual RL task with images drawn from arbitrarily large datasets. SPGym's key innovation lies in its ability to precisely control representation learning complexity through adjustable grid sizes and image pools, while maintaining fixed environment dynamics, observation, and action spaces. This design enables researchers to isolate and scale the visual representation challenge independently of other learning components. Through extensive experiments with model-free and model-based RL algorithms, we uncover fundamental limitations in current methods' ability to handle visual diversity. As we increase the pool of possible images, all algorithms exhibit in- and out-of-distribution performance degradation, with sophisticated representation learning techniques often underperforming simpler approaches like data augmentation. These findings highlight critical gaps in visual representation learning for RL and establish SPGym as a valuable tool for driving progress in robust, generalizable decision-making systems.

Abstract: The high computational costs of large language models (LLMs) have led to a flurry of research on LLM compression, via methods such as quantization, sparsification, or structured pruning. A new frontier in this area is given by dynamic, non-uniform compression methods, which adjust the compression levels (e.g., sparsity) per-block or even per-layer in order to minimize accuracy loss, while guaranteeing a global compression threshold. Yet, current methods rely on estimating the importance of a given layer, implicitly assuming that layers contribute independently to the overall compression error. We begin from the motivating observation that this independence assumption does not generally hold for LLM compression: pruning a model further may even significantly recover performance. To address this, we propose EvoPress, a novel evolutionary framework for dynamic LLM compression. By formulating dynamic compression as a general optimization problem, EvoPress identifies optimal compression profiles in a highly efficient manner, and generalizes across diverse models and compression techniques. Via EvoPress, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for dynamic compression of Llama, Mistral, and Phi models, setting new benchmarks for structural pruning (block/layer dropping), unstructured sparsity, and quantization with dynamic bitwidths. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/EvoPress}.

Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting perturbation effects via causal models. In many applications, it is a priori unknown which mechanisms of a system are modified by an external perturbation, even though the features of the perturbation are available. For example, in genomics, some properties of a drug may be known, but not their causal effects on the regulatory pathways of cells. We propose a generative intervention model (GIM) that learns to map these perturbation features to distributions over atomic interventions in a jointly-estimated causal model. Contrary to prior approaches, this enables us to predict the distribution shifts of unseen perturbation features while gaining insights about their mechanistic effects in the underlying data-generating process. On synthetic data and scRNA-seq drug perturbation data, GIMs achieve robust out-of-distribution predictions on par with unstructured approaches, while effectively inferring the underlying perturbation mechanisms, often better than other causal inference methods.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to acquire new classes while conserving historical knowledge incrementally. Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to \textit{catastrophic forgetting} that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, an adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of DPTA. Code is available in https://github.com/Yorkxzm/DPTA

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel neural operator, the Solute Transport Operator Network (STONet), to efficiently model contaminant transport in micro-cracked porous media. STONet's model architecture is specifically designed for this problem and uniquely integrates an enriched DeepONet structure with a transformer-based multi-head attention mechanism, enhancing performance without incurring additional computational overhead compared to existing neural operators. The model combines different networks to encode heterogeneous properties effectively and predict the rate of change of the concentration field to accurately model the transport process. The training data is obtained using finite element (FEM) simulations by random sampling of micro-fracture distributions and applied pressure boundary conditions, which capture diverse scenarios of fracture densities, orientations, apertures, lengths, and balance of pressure-driven to density-driven flow. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that, once trained, STONet achieves accurate predictions, with relative errors typically below 1% compared with FEM simulations while reducing runtime by approximately two orders of magnitude. This type of computational efficiency facilitates building digital twins for rapid assessment of subsurface contamination risks and optimization of environmental remediation strategies. The data and code for the paper will be published at https://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/STONet.

Abstract: We address the detection of emission reduction goals in corporate reports, an important task for monitoring companies' progress in addressing climate change. Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a key paradigm in privacy-preserving computing due to its "data usable but not visible" property, enabling users to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Motivated by this, federated recommendation systems offer a promising architecture that balances user privacy with recommendation accuracy through distributed collaborative learning. However, existing federated recommendation methods often neglect the underlying semantic or behavioral relationships between users during parameter aggregation, which limits their recommendation effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, graph-based federated recommendation systems have been proposed to leverage neighborhood information. Yet, conventional graph construction methods usually require access to raw user data or explicit social links, which contradicts the strict privacy requirements of federated learning. In this work, we propose UFGraphFR (User Text-feature-based Graph Federated Recommendation), a novel personalized federated recommendation framework that constructs a user graph based on clients' locally embedded text features. Our core assumption is that users with similar textual feature descriptions exhibit similar preferences. Accordingly, UFGraphFR introduces two key components: (1) a privacy-preserving user relationship graph constructed from the joint embedding layer's weight matrix without leaking raw user attributes; (2) a Transformer-based architecture to model temporal dependencies in user-item interaction sequences. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as MovieLens and HetRec2011 demonstrate that UFGraphFR achieves recommendation accuracy comparable to both centralized and state-of-the-art federated baselines while preserving user privacy.

Abstract: A novel Trunk-Branch (TB)-net physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture is developed, which is a PINN-based method incorporating trunk and branch nets to capture both global and local features. The aim is to solve four main classes of problems: forward flow problem, forward heat transfer problem, inverse heat transfer problem, and transfer learning problem within the porous medium, which are notoriously complex that could not be handled by origin PINN. In the proposed TB-net PINN architecture, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FNN) is used as the trunk net, followed by separated FNNs as the branch nets with respect to outputs, and automatic differentiation is performed for partial derivatives of outputs with respect to inputs by considering various physical loss. The effectiveness and flexibility of the novel TB-net PINN architecture is demonstrated through a collection of forward problems, and transfer learning validates the feasibility of resource reuse. Combining with the superiority over traditional numerical methods in solving inverse problems, the proposed TB-net PINN shows its great potential for practical engineering applications.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have shown promise in reducing bias in wind gust predictions, while still underpredicting high gusts. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) supports this issue by identifying when predictions are reliable or need cautious interpretation. Using data from 61 extratropical storms in the Northeastern USA, we introduce evidential neural network (ENN) as a novel approach for UQ in gust predictions, leveraging atmospheric variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Explainable AI techniques suggested that key predictive features contributed to higher uncertainty, which correlated strongly with storm intensity and spatial gust gradients. Compared to WRF, ENN demonstrated a 47% reduction in RMSE and allowed the construction of gust prediction intervals without an ensemble, successfully capturing at least 95% of observed gusts at 179 out of 266 stations. From an operational perspective, providing gust forecasts with quantified uncertainty enhances stakeholders' confidence in risk assessment and response planning for extreme gust events.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) enables agents to learn automatically and on-the-fly from their interactive experiences. However, a major challenge in scaling up ICRL is the lack of scalable task collections. To address this, we propose the procedurally generated tabular Markov Decision Processes, named AnyMDP. Through a carefully designed randomization process, AnyMDP is capable of generating high-quality tasks on a large scale while maintaining relatively low structural biases. To facilitate efficient meta-training at scale, we further introduce step-wise supervision and induce prior information in the ICRL framework.Our results demonstrate that, with a sufficiently large scale of AnyMDP tasks, the proposed model can generalize to tasks that were not considered in the training set. The scalable task set provided by AnyMDP also enables a more thorough empirical investigation of the relationship between data distribution and ICRL performance. We further show that the generalization of ICRL potentially comes at the cost of increased task diversity and longer adaptation periods. This finding carries critical implications for scaling robust ICRL capabilities, highlighting the necessity of diverse and extensive task design, and prioritizing asymptotic performance over few-shot adaptation.

<title>The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/lmsdss/LayerNorm-Scaling}{LayerNorm-Scaling}.

<title>A Good Start Matters: Enhancing Continual Learning with Data-Driven Weight Initialization</title>

Abstract: To adapt to real-world data streams, continual learning (CL) systems must rapidly learn new concepts while preserving and utilizing prior knowledge. When it comes to adding new information to continually-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), classifier weights for newly encountered categories are typically initialized randomly, leading to high initial training loss (spikes) and instability. Consequently, achieving optimal convergence and accuracy requires prolonged training, increasing computational costs. Inspired by Neural Collapse (NC), we propose a weight initialization strategy to improve learning efficiency in CL. In DNNs trained with mean-squared-error, NC gives rise to a Least-Square (LS) classifier in the last layer, whose weights can be analytically derived from learned features. We leverage this LS formulation to initialize classifier weights in a data-driven manner, aligning them with the feature distribution rather than using random initialization. Our method mitigates initial loss spikes and accelerates adaptation to new tasks. We evaluate our approach in large-scale CL settings, demonstrating faster adaptation and improved CL performance.

Abstract: Recent research has shown an increasing interest in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for a variety of time series applications. However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.

Abstract: The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.

Abstract: Tabular data poses unique challenges for deep learning due to its heterogeneous feature types, lack of spatial structure, and often limited sample sizes. We propose TabNSA, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Native Sparse Attention (NSA) with a TabMixer backbone to efficiently model tabular data. TabNSA tackles computational and representational challenges by dynamically focusing on relevant feature subsets per instance. The NSA module employs a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism, including token compression, selective preservation, and localized sliding windows, to significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of standard attention operations while addressing feature heterogeneity. Complementing this, the TabMixer backbone captures complex, non-linear dependencies through parallel multilayer perceptron (MLP) branches with independent parameters. These modules are synergistically combined via element-wise summation and mean pooling, enabling TabNSA to model both global context and fine-grained interactions. Extensive experiments across supervised and transfer learning settings show that TabNSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, by augmenting TabNSA with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), we enable it to effectively address Few-Shot Learning challenges through language-guided generalization on diverse tabular benchmarks.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, operates under potentially intermittent feedback, and features minimal memory complexity. IM-OCP guarantees long-term coverage and sub-linear regret, both of which hold deterministically for any given data sequence and in expectation with respect to the intermittent feedback.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception enhances each agent perceptual capabilities by sharing sensing information to cooperatively perform robot perception tasks. This approach has proven effective in addressing challenges such as sensor deficiencies, occlusions, and long-range perception. However, existing representative collaborative perception systems transmit intermediate feature maps, such as bird-eye view (BEV) representations, which contain a significant amount of non-critical information, leading to high communication bandwidth requirements. To enhance communication efficiency while preserving perception capability, we introduce CoCMT, an object-query-based collaboration framework that optimizes communication bandwidth by selectively extracting and transmitting essential features. Within CoCMT, we introduce the Efficient Query Transformer (EQFormer) to effectively fuse multi-agent object queries and implement a synergistic deep supervision to enhance the positive reinforcement between stages, leading to improved overall performance. Experiments on OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets show CoCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods while drastically reducing communication needs. On V2V4Real, our model (Top-50 object queries) requires only 0.416 Mb bandwidth, 83 times less than SOTA methods, while improving AP70 by 1.1 percent. This efficiency breakthrough enables practical collaborative perception deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments without sacrificing detection accuracy.

Abstract: A CAD command sequence is a typical parametric design paradigm in 3D CAD systems where a model is constructed by overlaying 2D sketches with operations such as extrusion, revolution, and Boolean operations. Although there is growing academic interest in the automatic generation of command sequences, existing methods and datasets only support operations such as 2D sketching, extrusion,and Boolean operations. This limitation makes it challenging to represent more complex geometries. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) training environment (gym) built on a CAD geometric engine. Given an input boundary representation (B-Rep) geometry, the policy network in the RL algorithm generates an action. This action, along with previously generated actions, is processed within the gym to produce the corresponding CAD geometry, which is then fed back into the policy network. The rewards, determined by the difference between the generated and target geometries within the gym, are used to update the RL network. Our method supports operations beyond sketches, Boolean, and extrusion, including revolution operations. With this training gym, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in generating command sequences from B-Rep geometries.

Abstract: As deep learning continues to be driven by ever-larger datasets, understanding which examples are most important for generalization has become a critical question. While progress in data selection continues, emerging applications require studying this problem in dynamic contexts. To bridge this gap, we pose the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, where examples arrive as a continuous stream, and need to be selected without access to the full data source. In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a training dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the underlying task. We find that in IDS, the impact of a new sample on the model state depends fundamentally on both its geometric relationship in the feature space and its prediction error. Leveraging this insight, we propose PEAKS (Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), an efficient data selection method tailored for IDS. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PEAKS consistently outperforms existing selection strategies. Furthermore, PEAKS yields increasingly better performance returns than random selection as training data size grows on real-world datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/BurakGurbuz97/PEAKS.

Abstract: A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed as an alternative paradigm for generative modeling. The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.

Abstract: Existing learning models often exhibit poor generalization when deployed across diverse scenarios. It is primarily due to that the underlying reference frame of the data varies with the deployment environment and settings. However, despite that data of each scenario has a distinct reference frame, its generation generally follows common underlying physical rules. Based on this understanding, this article proposes a deep learning framework named analogical learning (AL), which implicitly retrieves the reference frame information associated with a scenario and then to make accurate prediction by relative analogy with other scenarios. Specifically, we design a bipartite neural network called Mateformer. Its first part captures the relativity within multiple latent feature spaces between the input data and a small amount of embedded data from the studied scenario, while its second part uses this relativity to guide the nonlinear analogy. We apply AL to the typical multi-scenario learning problem of intelligent wireless localization in cellular networks. Extensive experiments validate AL's superiority across three key dimensions. First, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in single-scenario benchmarks. Second, it demonstrates stable transferability between different scenarios, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Finally, and most importantly, it robustly adapts to new, unseen scenarios--including dynamic weather and traffic conditions--without any tuning. All data and code are available at https://github.com/ziruichen-research/ALLoc.

Abstract: The rapid increase in computing power and the ability to store Big Data in the infrastructure has enabled predictions in a large variety of domains by Machine Learning. However, in many cases, existing Machine Learning tools are considered insufficient or incorrect since they exploit only probabilistic dependencies rather than inference logic. Causal Machine Learning methods seem to close this gap. In this paper, two prevalent tools based on Causal Machine Learning methods are compared, as well as their mathematical underpinning background. The operation of the tools is demonstrated by examining their response to 18 queries, based on the IDEAL Household Energy Dataset, published by the University of Edinburgh. First, it was important to evaluate the causal relations assumption that allowed the use of this approach; this was based on the preexisting scientific knowledge of the domain and was implemented by use of the in-built validation tools. Results were encouraging and may easily be extended to other domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many applications, including challenging reasoning problems via chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) techniques that generate ``thinking tokens'' before answering the questions. While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$ steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state, which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs, without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths simultaneously.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is largely hindered by their large number of parameters. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution. Prior structured pruning methods directly remove unimportant parameters based on certain metrics, which often causes knowledge loss and necessitates extensive retraining. To overcome this, we introduce a novel pruning method TRSP: Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs. Specifically, we multiply the output of each transformer layer by an initial learnable weight and iteratively learn these weights by adding their $\ell_1$-norm as a regularization term to the loss function, serving as the first-stage regularization. Subsequently, we apply additional regularization to the difference between the output and input of layers with smaller weights, encouraging the shift of knowledge to the preserved layers. This serves as the second-stage regularization. TRSP retains more knowledge and better preserves model performance than direct parameter elimination. Through extensive experimentation we show that TRSP outperforms strong layer-wise structured pruning methods without requiring retraining. As a layer-wise pruning method, it delivers notable end-to-end acceleration, making it a promising solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example. Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights, and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion, we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Abstract: Detecting structural change in dynamic network data has wide-ranging applications. Existing approaches typically divide the data into time bins, extract network features within each bin, and then compare these features over time. This introduces an inherent tradeoff between temporal resolution and the statistical stability of the extracted features. Despite this tradeoff, reminiscent of time-frequency tradeoffs in signal processing, most methods rely on a fixed temporal resolution. Choosing an appropriate resolution parameter is typically difficult and can be especially problematic in domains like cybersecurity, where anomalous behavior may emerge at multiple time scales. We address this challenge by proposing ANIE (Adaptive Network Intensity Estimation), a multi-resolution framework designed to automatically identify the time scales at which network structure evolves, enabling the joint detection of both rapid and gradual changes. Modeling interactions as Poisson processes, our method proceeds in two steps: (1) estimating a low-dimensional subspace of node behavior, and (2) deriving a set of novel empirical affinity coefficients that quantify change in interaction intensity between latent factors and support statistical testing for structural change across time scales. We provide theoretical guarantees for subspace estimation and the asymptotic behavior of the affinity coefficients, enabling model-based change detection. Experiments on synthetic networks show that ANIE adapts to the appropriate time resolution and is able to capture sharp structural changes while remaining robust to noise. Furthermore, applications to real-world data showcase the practical benefits of ANIE's multiresolution approach to detecting structural change over fixed resolution methods.

Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

<title>Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey</title>

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies, effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

Abstract: The investigation reported in this document focuses on identifying systems with symmetries using equivariant autoregressive reservoir computers. General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.

Abstract: Reliable diagnosis of brain tumors remains challenging due to low clinical incidence rates of such cases. However, this low rate is neglected in most of proposed methods. We propose a clinically inspired framework for anomaly-resilient tumor detection and classification. Detection leverages YOLOv8n fine-tuned on a realistically imbalanced dataset (1:9 tumor-to-normal ratio; 30,000 MRI slices from 81 patients). In addition, we propose a novel Patient-to-Patient (PTP) metric that evaluates diagnostic reliability at the patient level. Classification employs knowledge distillation: a Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) student model is distilled from a ResNet152 teacher. The distilled ViT achieves an F1-score of 0.92 within 20 epochs, matching near teacher performance (F1=0.97) with significantly reduced computational resources. This end-to-end framework demonstrates high robustness in clinically representative anomaly-distributed data, offering a viable tool that adheres to realistic situations in clinics.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in studying sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques for their advantages in dealing with simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods. They are devoted to learning the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. As a SNPE technique, the automatic posterior transformation (APT) method proposed by Greenberg et al. (2019) performs notably and scales to high dimensional data. However, the APT method bears the computation of an expectation of the logarithm of an intractable normalizing constant, i.e., a nested expectation. Although atomic APT was proposed to solve this by discretizing the normalizing constant, it remains challenging to analyze the convergence of learning. In this paper, we propose a nested APT method to estimate the involved nested expectation instead. This facilitates establishing the convergence analysis. Since the nested estimators for the loss function and its gradient are biased, we make use of unbiased multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators for debiasing. To further reduce the excessive variance of the unbiased estimators, this paper also develops some truncated MLMC estimators by taking account of the trade-off between the bias and the average cost. Numerical experiments for approximating complex posteriors with multimodal in moderate dimensions are provided.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score-function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a task-dependent score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived exactly from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.

Abstract: Conformal prediction methodology has recently been extended to the covariate shift setting, where the distribution of covariates differs between training and test data. While existing results ensure that the prediction sets from these methods achieve marginal coverage above a nominal level, their coverage rate conditional on the training dataset (referred to as training-conditional coverage) remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving upper bounds on the tail of the training-conditional coverage distribution, offering probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees for these methods. Our results quantify the relationship between the quality of the prediction sets and the severity of distributional changes, and can potentially be used to compute more efficient prediction sets.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b, Mistral-7b and GPT-4 on four benchmark Q\&amp;A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that training autoregressive video diffusion models from a single video stream$\unicode{x2013}$resembling the experience of embodied agents$\unicode{x2013}$is not only possible, but can also be as effective as standard offline training given the same number of gradient steps. Our work further reveals that this main result can be achieved using experience replay methods that only retain a subset of the preceding video stream. To support training and evaluation in this setting, we introduce four new datasets for streaming lifelong generative video modeling: Lifelong Bouncing Balls, Lifelong 3D Maze, Lifelong Drive, and Lifelong PLAICraft, each consisting of one million consecutive frames from environments of increasing complexity.

Abstract: The vast majority of the literature on learning dynamical systems or stochastic processes from time series has focused on stable or ergodic systems, for both Bayesian and frequentist inference procedures. However, most real-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be stable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales. Consistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one can ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when observations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on longer time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify metaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be exploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system, where inference on the global behavior may require much more data, or there is no theoretical guarantee as to the asymptotic success of inference procedures. We also discuss the relation between metaconsistency and the spectral properties of the model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic and non-ergodic diffusions.

Abstract: Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). To train the proposed model, we propose a novel coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter, despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.

Abstract: The Koopman operator plays a crucial role in analyzing the global behavior of dynamical systems. Existing data-driven methods for approximating the Koopman operator or discovering the governing equations of the underlying system typically require a fixed set of basis functions, also called dictionary. The optimal choice of basis functions is highly problem-dependent and often requires domain knowledge. We present a novel gradient descent-based optimization framework for learning suitable and interpretable basis functions from data and show how it can be used in combination with EDMD, SINDy, and PDE-FIND. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with the aid of various benchmark problems such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Chua's circuit, a nonlinear heat equation, as well as protein-folding data.

Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.

Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

Abstract: Associative memory architectures such as the Hopfield network have long been important conceptual and theoretical models for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, translating these abstract models into spiking neural networks has been surprisingly difficult. Indeed, much previous work has been restricted to storing a small number of primarily non-overlapping memories in large networks, thereby limiting their scalability. Here, we revisit the associative memory problem in light of recent advances in understanding spike-based computation. Using a recently-established geometric framework, we show that the spiking activity for a large class of all-inhibitory networks is situated on a low-dimensional, convex, and piecewise-linear manifold, with dynamics that move along the manifold. We then map the associative memory problem onto these dynamics, and demonstrate how the vertices of a hypercubic manifold can be used to store stable, overlapping activity patterns with a direct correspondence to the original Hopfield model. We propose several learning rules, and demonstrate a linear scaling of the storage capacity with the number of neurons, as well as robust pattern completion abilities. Overall, this work serves as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a geometrical perspective to design dynamics on neural manifolds, with implications for neuroscience and machine learning.

Abstract: L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a massively time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-systems) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.

<title>Scaling Inference-Time Search with Vision Value Model for Improved Visual Comprehension</title>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), there lacks effective approaches to enhance response quality by scaling inference-time computation. This capability is known to be a core step towards the self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this paper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time search to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically, VisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search step, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result from the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM steers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or insufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs' ability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer hallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other visual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with the VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of multimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving VLMs. Our value model and code are available at https://github.com/si0wang/VisVM.

<title>Geological and Well prior assisted full waveform inversion using conditional diffusion models</title>

Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) often faces challenges due to inadequate seismic observations, resulting in band-limited and geologically inaccurate inversion results. Incorporating prior information from potential velocity distributions, well-log information, and our geological knowledge and expectations can significantly improve FWI convergence to a realistic model. While diffusion-regularized FWI has shown improved performance compared to conventional FWI by incorporating the velocity distribution prior, it can benefit even more by incorporating well-log information and other geological knowledge priors. To leverage this fact, we propose a geological class and well-information prior-assisted FWI using conditional diffusion models. This method seamlessly integrates multi-modal information into FWI, simultaneously achieving data fitting and universal geologic and geophysics prior matching, which is often not achieved with traditional regularization methods. Specifically, we propose to combine conditional diffusion models with FWI, where we integrate well-log data and geological class conditions into these conditional diffusion models using classifier-free guidance for multi-modal prior matching beyond the original velocity distribution prior. Numerical experiments on the OpenFWI datasets and field marine data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional FWI and the unconditional diffusion-regularized FWI.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove sharp upper and lower bounds for the approximation of Sobolev functions by sums of multivariate ridge functions, i.e., for approximation by functions of the form $\mathbb{R}^d \ni x \mapsto \sum_{k=1}^n \varrho_k(A_k x) \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\varrho_k : \mathbb{R}^\ell \to \mathbb{R}$ and $A_k \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell \times d}$. We show that the order of approximation asymptotically behaves as $n^{-r/(d-\ell)}$, where $r$ is the regularity (order of differentiability) of the Sobolev functions to be approximated. Our lower bound even holds when approximating $L^\infty$-Sobolev functions of regularity $r$ with error measured in $L^1$, while our upper bound applies to the approximation of $L^p$-Sobolev functions in $L^p$ for any $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. These bounds generalize well-known results regarding the approximation properties of univariate ridge functions to the multivariate case. We use our results to obtain sharp asymptotic bounds for the approximation of Sobolev functions using generalized translation networks and complex-valued neural networks.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in Text-To-Audio (TTA) synthesis, enabling users to enrich their creative workflows with synthetic audio generated from natural language prompts. Despite this progress, the effects of data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models. Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally, we show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex and imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current benchmarks.

<title>BlockDialect: Block-wise Fine-grained Mixed Format Quantization for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: The rapidly increasing size of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average. Codes are available at: https://github.com/jiachenlei/rRCM.

<title>The Hidden Life of Tokens: Reducing Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Visual Information Steering</title>

arXiv:2502.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively over both textual and visual inputs, but they tend to hallucinate syntactically coherent yet visually ungrounded contents. In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits ranking throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss - visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation - semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information - visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decoded still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by about 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies. Code is available at https://github.com/LzVv123456/VISTA.

arXiv:2502.11900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the unknown interactions that govern a quantum system is crucial for quantum information processing, device benchmarking, and quantum sensing. The problem, known as Hamiltonian learning, is well understood under the assumption that interactions are local, but this assumption may not hold for arbitrary Hamiltonians. Previous methods all require high-order inverse polynomial dependency with precision, unable to surpass the standard quantum limit and reach the gold standard Heisenberg-limited scaling. Whether Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning is possible without prior assumptions about the interaction structures, a challenge we term \emph{ansatz-free Hamiltonian learning}, remains an open question. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm to learn arbitrary sparse Hamiltonians without any structure constraints using only black-box queries of the system's real-time evolution and minimal digital controls to attain Heisenberg-limited scaling in estimation error. Our method is also resilient to state-preparation-and-measurement errors, enhancing its practical feasibility. We numerically demonstrate our ansatz-free protocol for learning physical Hamiltonians and validating analog quantum simulations, benchmarking our performance against the state-of-the-art Heisenberg-limited learning approach. Moreover, we establish a fundamental trade-off between total evolution time and quantum control on learning arbitrary interactions, revealing the intrinsic interplay between controllability and total evolution time complexity for any learning algorithm. These results pave the way for further exploration into Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning in complex quantum systems under minimal assumptions, potentially enabling new benchmarking and verification protocols.

<title>Conformal Inference under High-Dimensional Covariate Shifts via Likelihood-Ratio Regularization</title>

arXiv:2502.13030v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on the KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.

Abstract: Stability for dynamic network embeddings ensures that nodes behaving the same at different times receive the same embedding, allowing comparison of nodes in the network across time. We present attributed unfolded adjacency spectral embedding (AUASE), a stable unsupervised representation learning framework for dynamic networks in which nodes are attributed with time-varying covariate information. To establish stability, we prove uniform convergence to an associated latent position model. We quantify the benefits of our dynamic embedding by comparing with state-of-the-art network representation learning methods on four real attributed networks. To the best of our knowledge, AUASE is the only attributed dynamic embedding that satisfies stability guarantees without the need for ground truth labels, which we demonstrate provides significant improvements for link prediction and node classification.

arXiv:2503.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Diffuse-CLoC, a guided diffusion framework for physics-based look-ahead control that enables intuitive, steerable, and physically realistic motion generation. While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning, they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level planner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream tasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the traditional hierarchical framework of high-level motion diffusion and low-level tracking.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel framework for VL alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is VL-CABS (Vision-Language Cross-Attention Based on Similarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.

Abstract: AI-powered stethoscopes offer a promising alternative for screening rheumatic heart disease (RHD), particularly in regions with limited diagnostic infrastructure. Early detection is vital, yet echocardiography, the gold standard tool, remains largely inaccessible in low-resource settings due to cost and workforce constraints. This review systematically examines machine learning (ML) applications from 2015 to 2025 that analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) data to support accessible, scalable screening of all RHD variants in relation to the World Heart Federation's "25 by 25" goal to reduce RHD mortality. Using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, 37 peer-reviewed studies were selected from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Embase. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominate recent efforts, achieving a median accuracy of 97.75%, F1-score of 0.95, and AUROC of 0.89. However, challenges remain: 73% of studies used single-center datasets, 81.1% relied on private data, only 10.8% were externally validated, and none assessed cost-effectiveness. Although 45.9% originated from endemic regions, few addressed demographic diversity or implementation feasibility. These gaps underscore the disconnect between model performance and clinical readiness. Bridging this divide requires standardized benchmark datasets, prospective trials in endemic areas, and broader validation. If these issues are addressed, AI-augmented auscultation could transform cardiovascular diagnostics in underserved populations, thereby aiding early detection. This review also offers practical recommendations for building accessible ML-based RHD screening tools, aiming to close the diagnostic gap in low-resource settings where conventional auscultation may miss up to 90% of cases and echocardiography remains out of reach.

<title>Chameleon: A MatMul-Free Temporal Convolutional Network Accelerator for End-to-End Few-Shot and Continual Learning from Sequential Data</title>

Abstract: On-device learning at the edge enables low-latency, private personalization with improved long-term robustness and reduced maintenance costs. Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way 5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots), while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.

Abstract: Deploying a Machine Learning (ML) training pipeline into production requires good software engineering practices. Unfortunately, the typical data science workflow often leads to code that lacks critical software quality attributes. This experience report investigates this problem in SPIRA, a project whose goal is to create an ML-Enabled System (MLES) to pre-diagnose insufficiency respiratory via speech analysis. This paper presents an overview of the architecture of the MLES, then compares three versions of its Continuous Training subsystem: from a proof of concept Big Ball of Mud (v1), to a design pattern-based Modular Monolith (v2), to a test-driven set of Microservices (v3) Each version improved its overall extensibility, maintainability, robustness, and resiliency. The paper shares challenges and lessons learned in this process, offering insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to productionize their pipelines.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from dynamical systems is the central interest of many scientific inquiries. Conditional Local Independence (CLI), which describes whether the evolution of one process is influenced by another process given additional processes, is important for causal learning in such systems. However, existing CLI tests were limited to counting processes. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric CLT test for It\^o processes. Specifically, we first introduce a testing statistic based on the Local Covariance Measure (LCM) by constructing a martingale from the conditional expectation of the process of interest. For estimation, we propose an efficient estimator based on the optimal filtering equation, which can achieve root-N consistency. To establish the asymptotic level and power of the test, we relax the restrictive boundedness condition to a moment bound condition, which is practical for It\^o processes. We verify the proposed test in synthetic and real-world experiments.

Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations. Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.

<title>Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064</link>

Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.

<div> Keywords: multi-task adaptation, model MoE-ization, conflict-resistant, oblivion-resistant, orthogonal transform <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new multi-task adaptation method called model MoE-ization to address task conflict and oblivion issues in large-scale foundation models. By applying SVD to the weight matrix of a pre-trained model and introducing a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples, the method transforms the weight matrix into a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE). Each expert corresponds to the outer product of left and right singular vectors, with the right singular vectors improved through a learnable orthogonal transform. Unlike existing methods like LoRA, MoORE ensures expert orthogonality and preserves the column space of the original weight matrix, making it resistant to conflicts and oblivion. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate MoORE's superiority in conflict- and oblivion-resistance compared to current multi-task adaptation methods. <div>

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance. The code of the experiments is available at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization (EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose \textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning (\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains. Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization performance.

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+ offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+ delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios. Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized predictive modeling.

<div> Keywords: online experiments, A/B tests, system tuning, recommender system, Bayesian optimization

Summary:
This article discusses the challenges of running online experiments, particularly in internet systems, known as A/B tests, for optimizing system performance. Decision-makers aim to optimize for long-term treatment effects, which can be challenging due to non-stationarity in treatment effects over time. Traditional sequential experimentation strategies are often time-consuming in such cases. The authors propose a novel approach that combines fast experiments or offline proxies with long-running experiments to enable sequential Bayesian optimization over large action spaces in a short period. By leveraging biased experiments and off-policy evaluation, this approach aims to achieve efficient and effective optimization of system changes without the need for extended experiment durations. This method shows promise for addressing the complexities of optimizing internet systems effectively and efficiently.

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

<div> Keywords: genetic variants, phenotypes, DeepWAS, neural network, predictive models <br />
Summary: <br />
Geneticists aim to understand how genetic variants affect phenotypes by analyzing large datasets. Existing methods face challenges in training models due to expensive linear algebra computations for correlated genomic variants. DeepWAS introduces a novel approach using advanced linear algebra techniques to train neural network models optimizing likelihood. Larger models show improved performance when trained on the full likelihood, compared to fitting summary statistics. This approach allows for better predictions of disease outcomes and identification of therapeutic targets. By leveraging more features in training, DeepWAS demonstrates the potential for enhanced precision in genetic variant impact predictions. <div>
arXiv:2506.19598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes -- traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions, potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target identification.

Neural Quantum States (NQS) utilize SineKAN, based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, as an ansatz to represent quantum wave functions using nested univariate functions. SineKAN's learnable sinusoidal activation functions effectively capture ground state energies, fidelities, and correlation functions for various quantum models.

Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society. Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012. However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Summary: 
CAM-NET is an AI model designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from Earth's surface to the ionosphere efficiently and accurately. It leverages SFNO and is trained on a decade of WACCM-X datasets, achieving a remarkable speedup in inference time. The model forecasts crucial atmospheric parameters, such as winds, temperature, and pressure variations with high precision. CAM-NET's modular architecture efficiently separates tracer prediction from core dynamics, enabling easy adaptation to different tracer scenarios without the need for retraining the entire model. Its performance on the $O^2$ tracer showcases strong performance and generalization capabilities, making it a valuable tool for understanding global-scale atmospheric dynamics and processes. <div>

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds, temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities.

<div> Keywords: Intelligent transportation systems, spatiotemporal traffic data, latent factorization of tensors, TDWLFT model, outlier detection

Summary:
The paper introduces the threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of Tensors (TDWLFT) model as a solution for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). ITS heavily relies on complete and high-quality traffic data, but issues like communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete datasets. Conventional LFT models are vulnerable to outliers due to the standard L2-norm used in their learning objective. The proposed TDWLFT model mitigates this vulnerability by assigning differentiated weights to individual samples in the loss function. Experimental results on two traffic speed datasets from urban environments demonstrate that the TDWLFT model outperforms existing approaches in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The model's improved performance makes it a promising solution for handling missing traffic data in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and high-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as communication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or corrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data, the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

<div> Keywords: everyday reasoning, deep learning models, feature-grounded embedding, interpretability, knowledge-based structured thinking

Summary:<br /><br />In everyday reasoning, our expectations about objects are shaped by our prior knowledge and formed conceptual categories. This paper explores reproducing this structured thinking in deep learning models by using feature-based embeddings. It introduces a specific approach to constructing feature-grounded embeddings that aims to align operable dictionary representations with interpretable conceptual features. By incorporating these domain-specific features into the model, the goal is to create shareable and interpretable representations that capture the unique properties of objects. This approach provides a framework for embedding knowledge-based thinking into deep learning systems, enhancing their ability to reason and make predictions based on learned features. By bridging the gap between our intuitive understanding of objects and machine learning models, this research contributes to the development of more interpretable and effective AI systems.

Abstract: In everyday reasoning, when we think about a particular object, we associate it with a unique set of expected properties such as weight, size, or more abstract attributes like density or horsepower. These expectations are shaped by our prior knowledge and the conceptual categories we have formed through experience. This paper investigates how such knowledge-based structured thinking can be reproduced in deep learning models using features based embeddings. Specially, it introduces an specific approach to build feature-grounded embedding, aiming to align shareable representations of operable dictionary with interpretable domain-specific conceptual features.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces a novel neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network, RL-Net, for radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). The network achieves a balance between performance and transparency, with an F1 score of 93.03% while simplifying the rule complexity significantly.

Abstract: Rule-based models offer interpretability but struggle with complex data, while deep neural networks excel in performance yet lack transparency. This work investigates a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network named RL-Net that learns interpretable rule lists through neural optimization, applied for the first time to radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). We benchmark RL-Net against a fully transparent rule-based system (MIRA) and an explainable black-box model (XentricAI), evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and user adaptability via transfer learning. Our results show that RL-Net achieves a favorable trade-off, maintaining strong performance (93.03% F1) while significantly reducing rule complexity. We identify optimization challenges specific to rule pruning and hierarchy bias and propose stability-enhancing modifications. Compared to MIRA and XentricAI, RL-Net emerges as a practical middle ground between transparency and performance. This study highlights the real-world feasibility of neuro-symbolic models for interpretable HGR and offers insights for extending explainable AI to edge-deployable sensing systems.

Abstract: The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC, pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate identification of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection, is essential for effective patient management and resource allocation. However, traditional models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced progression of PASC. In this study, we introduce the first publicly available cohort of 18 PASC patients, with text time series features based on Large Language Model Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and clinical risk annotated by clinical expert. We propose an Active Attention Network to predict the clinical risk and identify progression events related to the risk. By integrating human expertise with active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and enable progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The ultimate goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2 patient.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework. HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and security of next-generation CPS.

Summary:<br />
- EAGLE (Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings) is a novel deep learning framework for accurate cancer survival prediction by integrating diverse data modalities. 
- It uses dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms and massive dimensionality reduction to improve efficiency and maintain predictive performance. 
- EAGLE provides patient-level interpretability through three complementary attribution methods.
- Patient-level analysis demonstrated the importance of imaging features in high-risk individuals and balanced contributions in low-risk patients.
- Risk stratification based on EAGLE predictions identified clinically meaningful groups with significant differences in median survival, guiding treatment intensity decisions. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.22446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE (Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and (4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies: glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN, n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features, while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to 5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust in automated predictions.

<div> Keywords: Global Climate Models, Regional Climate Models, deep learning, multi-variable modeling, climate downscaling

Summary:
This study introduces a multi-task, multi-variable Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for downscaling climate variables over Europe. The proposed model, 1EMD, simultaneously predicts surface temperature, wind speed, and geopotential height from GCM-resolution inputs. By incorporating cross-variable interaction, the model outperforms single-variable baselines in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The approach shows positive cross-variable knowledge transfer, improving contextual awareness and reducing redundant computation. The study highlights the potential of multi-variable deep learning models for high-resolution climate downscaling, offering a promising alternative to traditional RCMs. <div>
arXiv:2506.22447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind), and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs, emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate downscaling.

arXiv:2506.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and reuse.
  In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level, link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations for relational data.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior in early training.

Summary:
The paper discusses the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values, focusing on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The authors demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be explained through mutual information (MI) maximization, revealing a link to contrastive learning. They propose a new approach, Mutual Information Optimization (MIO), which replaces the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations show that MIO outperforms DPO, particularly in maintaining chosen-likelihood during reasoning tasks and mathematical benchmarks. This work sheds light on the limitations of existing methods and offers a promising new direction for aligning LLMs with human values. The authors plan to release the model and code upon acceptance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks. We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

<div> transfer learning, adversarial robustness, fast gradient sign method (FGSM), fine-tuning, computational cost 

Summary: 
This study explores the use of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to enhance computational efficiency. The research reveals that FGSM is more stable in adversarial fine-tuning compared to training from scratch, showing no issues of catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets. The stability is further improved with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, allowing FGSM to remain stable even at higher perturbation levels. Comparative analysis with projected gradient descent (PGD) indicates that FGSM is a more efficient and well-performing alternative in adversarially robust transfer learning. It achieves similar test robustness with significantly less training time, making it a promising approach for improving computational cost in model training and adaptation for new tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.22602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive. However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or $\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39% and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using $4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust transfer learning but also a well-performing one.

Summary:
This paper presents a unified framework for handling simulation-based problems with mixed-variable inputs that exhibit hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured domains. The framework allows for the representation of input variables as continuous, integer, or categorical, with meta variables governing the presence of other decreed variables. Partially-decreed variables are introduced, whose activation depends on contextual conditions. Design space graphs are proposed to capture inter-variable hierarchical relationships, enabling the definition of complex system architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over hierarchical domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient modeling and optimization. These methods are implemented in the Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0) and demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system design, such as a case study in green aircraft architecture. <div>

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured. These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches. In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical. A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.

Summary:
The study focuses on online regression using unconstrained quadratic loss against time-varying functions in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Building on previous work, a new algorithm, H-VAW-D, combining discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) with random feature approximation is proposed. The algorithm dynamically learns the discount factor and number of random features, achieving an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} + \sqrt{T}\ln T)$. The computational complexity per iteration is $O(T\ln T). This hierarchical approach extends existing methods to the non-parametric domain, demonstrating improved performance in handling non-parametric data with time-varying functions. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm, which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of $O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} + \sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator sequence.

Summary: 
- Large language models show improved mathematical reasoning abilities through post-training techniques such as instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or knowledge distillation.
- A study was conducted using systematic layer-wise ablation experiments on various model variants to investigate the impact of different training paradigms on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
- Specific layer importance structures essential for mathematical reasoning were identified, which remained consistent across different post-training methods.
- Removal of these critical layers resulted in significant accuracy drops of up to 80%, indicating the specialized nature of these layers for mathematical tasks.
- In contrast, non-reasoning tasks like factual recall did not show the presence of critical layers, suggesting the unique requirements of mathematical reasoning in language models.
- The critical layers identified for mathematical reasoning were also found to be the same layers where major representational transformations occur, highlighting their importance in the information processing of language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned, knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that these critical layers are the same layers where major representational transformation occurs.

Summary:<br />
Machine learning surrogates are used to speed up solving systems dynamics in various applications, but they require large training datasets. The proposed BayPOD-AL framework uses uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal decomposition to learn reduced-order models from high-fidelity full-order models of complex systems. It effectively suggests informative data, reducing computational costs for training dataset construction compared to other active learning strategies. The framework shows effectiveness in predicting temperature evolution and generalizability when evaluated on datasets of higher temporal resolution.

Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering applications. To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems. Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training dataset.

Summary: 
This research paper introduces a novel approach to learning stochastic multiscale models directly from observational data in the physical sciences. The method utilizes stochastic differential equations to capture the dynamics of systems with a wide range of length and time scales. By resolving the state on a coarse mesh and introducing an auxiliary state for unresolved scales, the approach overcomes computational challenges associated with high-dimensional state spaces. The parameters of the multiscale model are learned using forward-solver-free amortized variational inference, inspired by physics-based multiscale modeling techniques like large-eddy simulation. Numerical studies demonstrate that the learned multiscale models outperform direct numerical simulation and closure-type models in terms of predictive accuracy at equivalent resolution.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly from observational data. Our method resolves the state on a coarse mesh while introducing an auxiliary state to capture the effects of unresolved scales. We learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a modern forward-solver-free amortized variational inference method. Our approach draws inspiration from physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, such as large-eddy simulation in fluid dynamics, while learning directly from data. We present numerical studies to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at equivalent resolution.

DistShap is a new algorithm designed to explain predictions made by graph neural networks (GNNs). It addresses the challenge of attributing predictions to specific edges or features, which can be computationally expensive in complex networks. By distributing Shapley value-based explanations across multiple GPUs, DistShap samples subgraphs, performs GNN inference in parallel, and computes edge importance scores using a distributed least squares problem. This approach outperforms existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and can scale to models with millions of features by utilizing up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer. DistShap's parallel processing capabilities make it an efficient and effective tool for explaining GNN predictions, offering an important advancement in the field of graph neural network interpretability.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example, classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting, executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer.

<title>Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Generative Personalization with a Surprisingly Simple Test-Time Embedding Adjustment</title>

<div> Keywords: semantic collapsing, generative personalization, visual concept, embedding adjustment, text-image alignment

Summary: 
The paper investigates semantic collapsing in generative personalization, where the learned visual concept can shift from its original meaning, leading to less contextually rich output images. The issue arises due to unconstrained optimization that allows the learned embedding to drift in direction and magnitude. To tackle this problem, a training-free method is proposed that adjusts the pre-trained embedding at inference time, mitigating semantic collapsing. This method is applicable across different personalization techniques and significantly improves text-image alignment in various scenarios. The code for the method is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Embedding-Adjustment. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept ($V^*$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V^*$ wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms such as "a photo of $V^*$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail to capture the intended concept.
  We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the learned embedding $V^*$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in diverse use cases. Our code is anonymously published at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Embedding-Adjustment.

<div> Memory bus, transformer, Residual Matrix Transformer, FLOPS, parameters

Summary: 
The Residual Matrix Transformer (RMT) introduces a novel approach to memory storage and retrieval in transformer models by replacing the residual stream with an outer product memory matrix. This innovation allows for independent scaling of the residual stream size, resulting in improved performance and efficiency. The RMT achieves the same loss as a traditional transformer with significantly fewer FLOPS, parameters, and training tokens. Furthermore, the RMT outperforms the transformer on downstream evaluations. Theoretical analysis shows that the RMT offers more efficient scaling of the residual stream and improved variance propagation properties. These findings mark a significant advancement in transformer model architecture and demonstrate the potential for enhanced performance in various natural language processing tasks. Code for the Residual Matrix Transformer project is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix (Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41% fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT, and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream, as well as improved variance propagation properties.

<div> Keywords: Peer-to-peer trading, Fairness, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Decentralized energy systems

Summary:
FairMarket-RL introduces a hybrid framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create fairness-aware trading agents in peer-to-peer microgrid markets. The framework utilizes an LLM as a real-time fairness critic, evaluating trading episodes based on Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS) metrics. Agents are trained using Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and incorporate fairness scores into their rewards via an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop. Results show that agents fulfill over 90% of buyer demand while maintaining fair seller margins and achieving high FTB and FBS scores. Fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. The scalability and practical applicability of the framework are demonstrated in a large power distribution system with household prosumers. FairMarket-RL presents a scalable, equity-driven solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

arXiv:2506.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics: Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled {\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes, fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

Summary: <br />
This study investigates the geometry of neural network loss landscapes in deep learning, focusing on linear mode connectivity (LMC) where independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths despite lying in distinct loss basins. The research introduces a unified framework encompassing four symmetry classes: permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general invertible maps. By incorporating these symmetries, the study successfully identifies linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision Transformers and GPT-2 models, revealing deeper structure in the loss landscape and emphasizing the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for understanding model space geometry. This broader framework expands the scope of valid reparameterizations beyond previous approaches, offering new insights into the connections between different models in neural network training. <div>
arXiv:2506.22712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths, despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations -- which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes: permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for understanding model space geometry.

Summary:
BEST-Route is a new query routing framework designed to optimize the usage of large language models (LLMs) by dynamically assigning queries to models of varying cost and quality. Traditional approaches often end up overusing expensive models, leading to missed cost-saving opportunities. BEST-Route differs by intelligently selecting a model and the number of responses to sample based on query difficulty and quality thresholds. By leveraging the benefits of generating multiple responses from small models and selecting the best one, the framework achieves cost reductions of up to 60% with minimal performance impact. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of BEST-Route in achieving a balance between cost efficiency and quality in LLM deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: BEST-Route is a novel query routing framework that optimizes the use of large language models by dynamically selecting models and response sampling based on query difficulty and quality thresholds.

arXiv:2506.22716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off. Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings. However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Summary:
The article introduces a new Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model to address issues of missing values and noise in spatiotemporal traffic data. Traditional tensor completion methods are ineffective in complex scenarios with both missing data and noise. The RTC-GTNLN model utilizes a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate and a gradient tensor nuclear L1-L2 norm to enhance low-rank representation and local consistency in the data. The model successfully integrates global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameters, improving accuracy in data recovery. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model outperforms existing methods in recovering data affected by missing values and noise. <div>
arXiv:2506.22732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications. while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2 norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy, we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new training approach for neural networks using low-precision quantization and the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm. This approach aims to improve the efficiency of training on resource-constrained edge devices. By leveraging the layer-by-layer strategy of FF, the INT8 quantized training method stabilizes gradient quantization and reduces memory usage. The proposed "look-ahead" scheme addresses limitations of the FF algorithm and enhances model accuracy. Experimental results on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board show that the approach achieves 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and a 27.0% reduction in memory usage while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing methods. The combination of low-precision quantization, FF algorithm, and look-ahead scheme demonstrates promising results for efficient neural network training on edge devices.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass. By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

Summary: 
Score-based diffusion modeling is a powerful generative machine learning approach that leverages a learned score function to sample from complex distributions. This method enables both sample generation and zero-shot conditioning on observed data, offering a new framework for data and model fusion. In this study, the concept is applied to super-resolution of high-dimensional dynamical systems using real-time low-resolution and sparse sensor measurements. The generative model successfully reconstructs the high-dimensional state from multiple sources of low-fidelity measurements, such as the ERA5 atmospheric dataset and the IGRA radiosonde dataset. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to balance the influence of different dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions. The experiments highlight the potential of score-based diffusion models for handling multimodal data and generating accurate high-dimensional reconstructions with uncertainty estimates. <div>
arXiv:2506.22780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained, score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Summary:<br />
The article addresses the problem of model attribution and fingerprints in generative models (GMs) by introducing a novel definition based on Riemannian geometry. This approach aims to differentiate synthetic from human data and combat model collapse due to regurgitative training. By leveraging differential geometry, the proposed definition of artifacts and fingerprints in GMs improves the effectiveness of distinguishing between a wide range of models across different datasets, resolutions, architectures, and modalities. The new gradient-based algorithm for computing fingerprints demonstrates significant performance gains in model attribution and generalization to unseen data, models, and modalities. This research fills a gap in understanding GM fingerprints and provides a principled framework for analyzing and representing these fingerprints effectively. The results suggest the practical efficacy of the proposed approach in enhancing the authenticity and trustworthiness of generative models. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints. For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way. To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2 different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2 modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its practical efficacy.

Summary:
The article introduces a comprehensive dataset on migration flows between 230 countries from 1990 to the present, disaggregated by country of birth. Utilizing a deep recurrent neural network trained on various covariates, including geographic and economic factors, the model captures long-range temporal correlations in migration patterns. By employing an ensemble approach and quantifying uncertainty in covariates, the model provides confidence bounds for all estimates, aiding in identifying regions requiring additional data collection. Validation tests show superior performance compared to traditional methods, offering increased temporal resolution in estimating annual migration flows. The open-source nature of the model, with publicly available data and code, serves as a valuable resource for future research on human migration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the last 43 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource for future studies of human migration.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method utilizing the xLSTM architecture designed for multivariate time series data. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure, with the encoder capturing historical context and the decoder having forecasting and reconstruction approaches. Two loss functions, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW), are used to analyze local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment. The method is evaluated on the TSB-AD-M benchmark with 17 real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy surpassing 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. This work highlights the potential of xLSTM for anomaly detection and opens up new possibilities in this area. The code for xLSTMAD is publicly available for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), are emerging as a powerful alternative to classical machine learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification, across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum machine learning into their work.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of structure learning ensemble (SLE) to enhance the accuracy of learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from large datasets. By combining multiple BN structure learning algorithms, the proposed SLE approach consistently achieves high learning accuracy. An automatic approach called Auto-SLE is presented to learn near-optimal SLEs, eliminating the need for manual design. The integration of SLE into a divide-and-conquer method results in superior performance compared to using a single BN structure learning algorithm, with accuracy improvements ranging from 30% to 225% on datasets with 10,000 variables. The method's scalability is demonstrated on datasets with up to 30,000 variables, surpassing traditional approaches. These findings highlight the potential of utilizing SLEs, especially when learned automatically, for efficient and accurate BN structure learning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging, especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently proposed divide-and-conquer (D\&amp;D) strategies present a promising approach for learning large BNs. However, they still face a main issue of unstable learning accuracy across subproblems. In this work, we introduce the idea of employing structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs, addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned SLE is then integrated into a D\&amp;D method. Extensive experiments firmly show the superiority of our method over D\&amp;D methods with single BN structure learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore, our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables and different network characteristics than those present in the training data for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) as a simple yet effective method for model distribution in bandwidth-constrained environments. P$^2$U transmits a lower-bit precision model along with a model update to achieve better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage, and latency. Experiments across various model architectures and datasets demonstrate consistent improvement in performance. P$^2$U allows for aggressive quantization without compromising performance, making it suitable for low-resource settings like federated learning and edge computing.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Efficient model distribution is becoming increasingly critical in bandwidth-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this problem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U transmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing the difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted low precision version. With extensive experiments on various model architectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a large model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data sets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U consistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and latency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority, aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising performance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical solution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource settings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments. Given that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be implemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification, quantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.

<div> Sparse Autoregression, Interpretable Machine Learning, Periodicity Quantification, Mixed-Integer Optimization, Spatially- and Time-Varying Model

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel sparse autoregression framework for time series data, enhancing model interpretability through $\ell_0$-norm induced sparsity constraints. By reformulating the model as a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) problem, a decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy based on subspace pursuit accelerates the process. For multidimensional time series, a spatially- and time-varying sparse autoregression model is proposed, with a two-stage optimization scheme making it scalable for large datasets. Empirical evaluations on real-world data showcase the effectiveness of the models. Daily and weekly periodicities in ridesharing trips and long-term changes in human mobility regularity are uncovered. Climate variable time series analysis reveals spatial patterns of yearly seasonality over four decades, aiding in the identification of dynamic climate patterns like El Nino in sea surface temperature. <div>

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea surface temperature.

Summary: 
MAGNET (Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) is proposed to address the challenge of missing modalities in multimodal biological data analysis. Unlike current fusion methods that struggle with diverse missing-modality patterns, MAGNET introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their importance and missingness. Its complexity increases linearly with the number of modalities, adapting to missing-pattern variability. By constructing a patient graph with fused multimodal embeddings and using a graph neural network for predictions, MAGNET outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in cancer classification tasks using real-world datasets. The availability of the data and code on GitHub facilitates reproducibility and further research in this area. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients. Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET (Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods.

The article introduces a framework called Infinite Sampling to enhance the efficiency and scalability of Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) for training large language models with human feedback. Infinite Sampling consists of micro sampling groups to reduce memory usage, continuous sampling to optimize generation across groups, and a length-aware scheduler for efficient grouping and runtime refill. Experiments demonstrate that the Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by 50% compared to full-group decoding, while Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over 25% compared to naive micro sampling methods. The hybrid scheduling approach ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups within realistic GPU memory constraints. <div>

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) have proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with human feedback. However, generating and storing multiple responses per prompt incurs substantial memory overhead, especially as the sample group size increases, limiting scalability under constrained hardware.
  We propose Infinite Sampling, a framework that enables efficient and stable GRPO training by decoupling group size from GPU memory usage. It consists of: (1) micro sampling groups that decompose large groups into memory-feasible rounds; (2) continuous sampling that interleaves generation across groups to improve utilization; and (3) a length-aware scheduler combining token-conditioned sequence length prediction with a two-stage plan: global grouping via FPTAS and runtime refill via SJF.
  Experiments show that our Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by over 50% compared to full-group decoding (e.g., from 21.55 GB to 10.64 GB on Qwen3-1.7B). Building on this, Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over 25% compared to the naive micro sampling group method, reducing decoding steps while maintaining full-length completions and memory usage. Our hybrid scheduling ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups under realistic GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position, speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns. First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors. Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation, storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management. Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production, consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust solution for intelligent microgrid management.

Summary:
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are powerful for solving PDEs, but struggle to achieve high precision. This study introduces the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer) to improve accuracy. The BWLer models the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation, addressing precision limitations in multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs alone stall at low precision levels, but adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling, revealing a tradeoff between accuracy and PDE conditioning. With spectral derivatives and preconditioning, the tradeoff can be navigated effectively during training. By incorporating a BWLer, RMSE is improved significantly for various benchmark PDEs, reaching near-machine precision levels on certain problems. This approach combines the flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers, offering a promising path for high-precision PDE solutions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand. In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely (explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning, adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

Summary:
The article introduces ternary language models (TriLMs) as a solution to the inference efficiency challenge faced by large language models (LLMs), particularly due to GPU memory limitations. It discusses the scalability of TriLMs, highlighting their benefits from increasing training data rather than scaling model parameters. The Spectra-1.1 suite of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens is presented, showcasing improved performance at scale. Additionally, novel packing schemes for ternary weights are proposed to enhance inference efficiency across CPU architectures. The development of the TriRun GPU kernel further accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to floating-point baselines. The release of the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels is aimed at encouraging further exploration and development of efficient LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally, creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also, building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels. Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints. However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions, including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally, benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.

Summary: 
This paper investigates the robustness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies through the analysis of network parameters under internal and external stresses. It introduces synaptic filtering inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience to internally perturb parameters and adversarial attacks to externally modify agent observations. By categorizing parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile based on their impact on policy performance in clean and adversarial conditions, the study defines parameter scores to quantify these characteristics. The framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments, revealing the presence of antifragile parameters that improve policy performance under stress.

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

This paper addresses the challenge of knowledge transfer from pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) to small production models. It explores methods to fine-tune ViTs for more effective knowledge transfer by employing mutual information-aware optimization during finetuning. Additionally, for small or highly-imbalanced datasets, a heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks is introduced to enhance distillation effectiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However, the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer. Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those pretrained models among the strongest.

Abstract: Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty. Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5 (55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%). We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

<div> Keywords: world model, causal graph, meta states, agent, exploration

Summary: 
The article presents a novel approach to building world models called Meta-Causal Graph, which captures shifting causal mechanisms in the environment. It addresses the challenge of modeling complex systems where causal relationships can change with different states or policies. The Meta-Causal Graph consists of multiple causal subgraphs triggered by meta states in the latent space. A Causality-Seeking Agent is introduced to identify meta states, discover causal relationships through intervention policies, and refine the graph through exploration and experience. Experimental results on synthetic tasks and a robot arm manipulation task show the method's ability to capture causal dynamics shifts and generalize to new contexts effectively. The Meta-Causal Graph framework provides a unified representation for understanding and adapting to changing causal structures in dynamic environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.23068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.

<div> Keywords: machine unlearning, privacy preservation, multimodal medical data, Forget-MI, Membership Inference Attack 

Summary: 
Forget-MI is a novel machine unlearning method designed to address privacy preservation in AI, particularly in healthcare settings where sensitive patient data is utilized. By establishing loss functions and perturbation techniques, Forget-MI focuses on removing patient data from trained multimodal architectures while retaining knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining performance levels similar to the original model. Evaluation of Forget-MI includes performance on the forget dataset, test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack (MIA). Results show that Forget-MI outperforms existing approaches in terms of reducing MIA and decreasing AUC and F1 scores on the forget dataset while maintaining performance on the test set. The approach reduces MIA by 0.202 and improves overall privacy while maintaining model performance. The code for Forget-MI is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning, existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack (MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305, respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/Forget-MI.git

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer, preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons recorded via smartphone sensors.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data - affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies without the need for negative training data.

Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a $2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization. Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature, and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said learning problems are NP-hard.

Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility. However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors, such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information. We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/haorandd/M2oE2\_load\_forecast.git.

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy. However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning, which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model performance and low computing cost.

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values. Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated and benchmark images, as well.

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation. The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating (MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments, the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

<title>Sub-MoE: Efficient Mixture-of-Expert LLMs Compression via Subspace Expert Merging</title>

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges. Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared $U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$ components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1) Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2) Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains 96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released at https://github.com/lliai/MoERazor.

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability, openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce increasingly long tasks asynchronously \citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

<title>BAPE: Learning an Explicit Bayes Classifier for Long-tailed Visual Recognition</title>

Abstract: Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by \emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets. However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently, our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks, despite its simplicity.

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated, case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases, there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of deep learning.

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity, and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code_HDTree_review-A8DB.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering, automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is essential.

<title>A case for data valuation transparency via DValCards</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML), various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy). Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices, resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1) common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

arXiv:2506.23358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

<title>When Additive Noise Meets Unobserved Mediators: Bivariate Denoising Diffusion for Causal Discovery</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23374</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.23374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD) for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor, enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy, interpretable AI agents across complex domains.

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains, makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes, distributions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.23424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2) a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BorealisAI/PETSA

<title>Enhancing Insider Threat Detection Using User-Based Sequencing and Transformer Encoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.23446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores. These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets, including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61% accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses. Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.

arXiv:2506.23492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident, posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature (SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled, robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification in neural network predictions. The source code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SMART-8B11.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit communication scenarios.

<title>Both Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Convergence of Quasi-Hyperbolic Momentum using Increasing Batch Size</title>

arXiv:2506.23544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization -- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for training neural networks.

arXiv:2506.23551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching (TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii) Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and hyperparameters.

<title>When Will It Fail?: Anomaly to Prompt for Forecasting Future Anomalies in Time Series</title>

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP) that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/AP.

<title>A Nonlinear Low-rank Representation Model with Convolutional Neural Network for Imputing Water Quality Data</title>

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However, water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots, and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches to modular exponentiation.

Abstract: We introduce DABstep, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on realistic multi-step data analysis tasks. DABstep comprises over 450 real-world challenges derived from a financial analytics platform, requiring models to combine code-based data processing with contextual reasoning over heterogeneous documentation. Each task demands an iterative, multi-step problem-solving approach, testing capabilities in data manipulation, cross-referencing multiple sources, and precise result reporting. The benchmark provides a factoid-style answer format with automatic correctness checks for objective scoring at scale. We evaluate leading LLM-based agents, revealing a substantial performance gap: even the best agent achieves only 14.55% accuracy on the hardest tasks. We detail our benchmark's design, dataset composition, task formulation, evaluation protocol, report baseline results and analyze failure modes. DABstep is released with a public leaderboard and toolkit to accelerate research in autonomous data analysis.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data. While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates robust generalization under system misspecification between training and deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

<title>Radioactive Watermarks in Diffusion and Autoregressive Image Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete and continuous weights, for deterministic and stochastic spiking networks, using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient training methods for deep Bayesian networks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.23776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process discovery algorithms automatically extract process models from event logs, but high variability often results in complex and hard-to-understand models. To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process executions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable process model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning traces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process models. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process model discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or probability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to capture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace clustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster. Our approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on directly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows clustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's process model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given stochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales linearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing clusters with clearer control-flow patterns. Extensive experiments on public real-life datasets show that our method outperforms existing alternatives in representing process behavior and reveals how clustering performance rankings can shift when stochasticity is considered.

<title>Calibrating Graph Neural Networks with Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling</title>

arXiv:2506.23782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings, thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to 42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient, scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be released based on publication.

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable, model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error, requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-, and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

Abstract: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process. Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities for their application in complex tasks.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a novel adaptive anomaly detection framework specifically designed for monitoring sequential random finite set (RFS) observations. Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data (normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the expected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative simulation experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type preconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified convergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or matrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover state-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient methods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In addition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed algorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for the latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and DASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov momentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that AdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal preconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the practical efficiency of Adam.

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods to further boost their performance.

Abstract: Understanding team formations and player positioning is crucial for tactical analysis in football (soccer). This paper presents a flexible method for formation recognition and player position assignment in football using predefined static formation templates and cost minimization from spatiotemporal tracking data, called EFPI. Our approach employs linear sum assignment to optimally match players to positions within a set of template formations by minimizing the total distance between actual player locations and template positions, subsequently selecting the formation with the lowest assignment cost. To improve accuracy, we scale actual player positions to match the dimensions of these formation templates in both width and length. While the method functions effectively on individual frames, it extends naturally to larger game segments such as complete periods, possession sequences or specific intervals (e.g. 10 second intervals, 5 minute intervals etc.). Additionally, we incorporate an optional stability parameter that prevents unnecessary formation changes when assignment costs differ only marginally between time segments. EFPI is available as open-source code through the unravelsports Python package.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness. Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability, fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

Abstract: Living plants, while contributing to ecological balance and climate regulation, also function as natural sensors capable of transmitting information about their internal physiological states and surrounding conditions. This rich source of data provides potential for applications in environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. With integration into biohybrid systems, we establish novel channels of physiological signal flow between living plants and artificial devices. We equipped *Hedera helix* with a plant-wearable device called PhytoNode to continuously record the plant's electrophysiological activity. We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor environment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions. Over five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and automated machine learning (AutoML). Our classification models achieve high performance, reaching macro F1 scores of up to 95 percent in binary tasks. AutoML approaches outperformed manual tuning, and selecting subsets of statistical features further improved accuracy. Our biohybrid living system monitors the electrophysiology of plants in harsh, real-world conditions. This work advances scalable, self-sustaining, and plant-integrated living biohybrid systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies.

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites, particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades. Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential towards improving process control and product quality in composites manufacturing.

Abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing healthcare due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this challenge by transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context). The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users -- such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities. Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety. Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed, accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique 3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only ~50M active parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to build increasingly capable AI models.

<title>A Scalable Approach for Safe and Robust Learning via Lipschitz-Constrained Networks</title>

Abstract: Certified robustness is a critical property for deploying neural networks (NN) in safety-critical applications. A principle approach to achieving such guarantees is to constrain the global Lipschitz constant of the network. However, accurate methods for Lipschitz-constrained training often suffer from non-convex formulations and poor scalability due to reliance on global semidefinite programs (SDPs). In this letter, we propose a convex training framework that enforces global Lipschitz constraints via semidefinite relaxation. By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a convex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training. While the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is limited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized subspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the global constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto low-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training objective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly improved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

<title>The Illusion of Progress? A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$ framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets. While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and efficacy.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs, which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

The data pipeline we use is multi-stage, employing a language model to autonomously crawl and score audio recordings from the internet based on their metadata, followed by a stage of pruning and segmentation using an audio classifier. The resulting dataset contains over one million distinct MIDI files, comprising roughly 100,000 hours of transcribed audio. We provide an in-depth analysis of our techniques, offering statistical insights, and investigate the content by extracting metadata tags, which we also provide.

<title>From Model Design to Organizational Design: Complexity Redistribution and Trade-Offs in Generative AI</title>

arXiv:2506.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off, therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration.

Abstract: Since weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, reliable decision making requires information on the likelihoods of future weather scenarios. We explore the sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h Pangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a specific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV) method does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to numerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth within a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast model to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly based on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each iteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are expected to turn into directions of growing errors. We show that A-SV indeed finds dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather model, which grow right from the beginning of the forecast rollout. These perturbations describe local unstable modes and could be a basis to initialize MLWP ensembles. Since we start A-SV from random noise perturbations, the algorithm transforms noise into perturbations conditioned on a given reference state - a process that is akin to the denoising process of the generic diffusion based ML model of GenCast, therefor we briefly discuss similarities and differences.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time, data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL) introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity (recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836 subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms. Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography (sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion (MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation. MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation (ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into dynamic cognitive states.

Abstract: We introduce Hindsight-Guided Momentum (HGM), a first-order optimization algorithm that adaptively scales learning rates based on the directional consistency of recent updates. Traditional adaptive methods, such as Adam or RMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often overlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional information, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates, which reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path. HGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the cosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This allows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions, increasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of oscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that accelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining stability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability, the method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing optimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the optimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over existing approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep neural network training.

<title>Service Placement in Small Cell Networks Using Distributed Best Arm Identification in Linear Bandits</title>

Abstract: As users in small cell networks increasingly rely on computation-intensive services, cloud-based access often results in high latency. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) mitigates this by bringing computational resources closer to end users, with small base stations (SBSs) serving as edge servers to enable low-latency service delivery. However, limited edge capacity makes it challenging to decide which services to deploy locally versus in the cloud, especially under unknown service demand and dynamic network conditions. To tackle this problem, we model service demand as a linear function of service attributes and formulate the service placement task as a linear bandit problem, where SBSs act as agents and services as arms. The goal is to identify the service that, when placed at the edge, offers the greatest reduction in total user delay compared to cloud deployment. We propose a distributed and adaptive multi-agent best-arm identification (BAI) algorithm under a fixed-confidence setting, where SBSs collaborate to accelerate learning. Simulations show that our algorithm identifies the optimal service with the desired confidence and achieves near-optimal speedup, as the number of learning rounds decreases proportionally with the number of SBSs. We also provide theoretical analysis of the algorithm's sample complexity and communication overhead.

Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal, phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization, during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of BCIs.

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores. However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex, multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial. To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames. By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations. Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance, orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021 and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The codebase for this work can be found on our \href{https://github.com/bakerhassan/Patch2Loc}{GitHub page}.

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain, obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics.

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction; b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA, RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging. Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters, although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical practice.

Abstract: Detecting a minor average treatment effect is a major challenge in large-scale applications, where even minimal improvements can have a significant economic impact. Traditional methods, reliant on normal distribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor effects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with sufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework and proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by weighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The implementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and efficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates that our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null hypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis, greatly improving statistical power. The experimental results indicate a significant improvement in the A/B testing, highlighting the potential to reduce experimental costs while maintaining high statistical power.

Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence. We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs). Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes. Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement schemes tend to slow convergence.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have exposed them to increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Among these, obfuscation-based attacks -- which encrypt malicious content to evade detection -- remain highly effective. By leveraging the reasoning ability of advanced LLMs to interpret encrypted prompts, such attacks circumvent conventional defenses that rely on keyword detection or context filtering. These methods are very difficult to defend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or decode ciphered content. In this work, we propose \textbf{MetaCipher}, a novel obfuscation-based jailbreak framework, along with a reinforcement learning-based dynamic cipher selection mechanism that adaptively chooses optimal encryption strategies from a cipher pool. This approach enhances jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability across diverse task types, victim LLMs, and safety guardrails. Our framework is modular and extensible by design, supporting arbitrary cipher families and accommodating evolving adversarial strategies. We complement our method with a large-scale empirical analysis of cipher performance across multiple victim LLMs. Within as few as 10 queries, MetaCipher achieves over 92\% attack success rate (ASR) on most recent standard malicious prompt benchmarks against state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs, and over 74\% ASR against reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming all existing obfuscation-based jailbreak methods. These results highlight the long-term robustness and adaptability of our approach, making it more resilient than prior methods in the face of advancing safety measures.

Abstract: Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution -- where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy function -- have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion samplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical model -- the Schr\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution. Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

Abstract: In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information. Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal data across diverse sectors, including education, healthcare, and finance.
  This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models, our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture's foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.

Abstract: While age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) provide the most extensive record of reproductive change, their aggregate nature masks the underlying behavioral mechanisms that ultimately drive fertility trends. To recover these mechanisms, we develop a likelihood-free Bayesian framework that couples an individual-level model of the reproductive process with Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE). This allows us to infer eight behavioral and biological parameters from just two aggregate series: ASFRs and the age-profile of planned versus unplanned births. Applied to U.S. National Survey of Family Growth cohorts and to Demographic and Health Survey cohorts from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Peru, the method reproduces observed fertility schedules and, critically, predicts out-of-sample micro-level distributions of age at first sex, inter-birth intervals, and family-size ideals, none of which inform the estimation step. Because the fitted model yields complete synthetic life histories, it enables behaviorally explicit population forecasts and supports the construction of demographic digital twins.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves model performance.

Abstract: Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in popularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues, such as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items as low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading solution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms. The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30\% of the datasets, being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient with an average training time reduction of 274\% compared to other embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and efficiently.

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

Abstract: Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant prediction.

Abstract: This paper studies theoretical lower bounds for estimating the trace of a matrix function, $\text{tr}(f(A))$, focusing on methods that use Hutchinson's method along with Block Krylov techniques. These methods work by approximating matrix-vector products like $f(A)V$ using a Block Krylov subspace. This is closely related to approximating functions with polynomials. We derive theoretical upper bounds on how many Krylov steps are needed for functions such as $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$ by analyzing the upper bounds from the polynomial approximation of their scalar equivalent. In addition, we also develop lower limits on the number of queries needed for trace estimation, specifically for $\text{tr}(W^{-p})$ where $W$ is a Wishart matrix. Our study clarifies the connection between the number of steps in Block Krylov methods and the degree of the polynomial used for approximation. This links the total cost of trace estimation to basic limits in polynomial approximation and how much information is needed for the computation.

<title>Libra: Synergizing CUDA and Tensor Cores for High-Performance Sparse Matrix Multiplication</title>

Abstract: Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly equipped with Tensor cores and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The former brings superior computing power but only for structured matrix multiplication, while the latter has relatively lower performance but with higher programming flexibility. In this work, we discover that utilizing one resource alone leads to inferior performance for sparse matrix multiplication, due to their respective limitations. To this end, we propose Libra, a systematic approach that enables synergistic computation between CUDA and Tensor cores to achieve the best performance for sparse matrix multiplication. Specifically, we propose a 2D-aware workload distribution strategy to find out the sweet point of task mapping for different sparse operators, leveraging both the high performance of Tensor cores and the low computational redundancy on CUDA cores. In addition, Libra incorporates systematic optimizations for heterogeneous computing, including hybrid load-balancing, finely optimized kernel implementations, and GPU-accelerated preprocessing. Extensive experimental results on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs show that Libra outperforms the state-of-the-art by on average 3.1x (up to 9.23x) over DTC-SpMM and 2.9x (up to 3.9x) for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for sparse operator acceleration by fully exploiting the heterogeneous computing resources on GPUs.

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands, resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection, model training, and edge deployment.

Abstract: Persistence is often regarded as a virtue in science. In this paper, however, we challenge this conventional view by highlighting its contextual nature, particularly how persistence can become a liability during periods of paradigm shift. We focus on the deep learning revolution catalyzed by AlexNet in 2012. Analyzing the 20-year career trajectories of over 5,000 scientists who were active in top machine learning venues during the preceding decade, we examine how their research focus and output evolved. We first uncover a dynamic period in which leading venues increasingly prioritized cutting-edge deep learning developments that displaced relatively traditional statistical learning methods. Scientists responded to these changes in markedly different ways. Those who were previously successful or affiliated with old teams adapted more slowly, experiencing what we term a rigidity penalty - a reluctance to embrace new directions leading to a decline in scientific impact, as measured by citation percentile rank. In contrast, scientists who pursued strategic adaptation - selectively pivoting toward emerging trends while preserving weak connections to prior expertise - reaped the greatest benefits. Taken together, our macro- and micro-level findings show that scientific breakthroughs act as mechanisms that reconfigure power structures within a field.

<title>Can We Reliably Predict the Fed's Next Move? A Multi-Modal Approach to U.S. Monetary Policy Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Forecasting central bank policy decisions remains a persistent challenge for investors, financial institutions, and policymakers due to the wide-reaching impact of monetary actions. In particular, anticipating shifts in the U.S. federal funds rate is vital for risk management and trading strategies. Traditional methods relying only on structured macroeconomic indicators often fall short in capturing the forward-looking cues embedded in central bank communications.
  This study examines whether predictive accuracy can be enhanced by integrating structured data with unstructured textual signals from Federal Reserve communications. We adopt a multi-modal framework, comparing traditional machine learning models, transformer-based language models, and deep learning architectures in both unimodal and hybrid settings.
  Our results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal baselines. The best performance is achieved by combining TF-IDF features of FOMC texts with economic indicators in an XGBoost classifier, reaching a test AUC of 0.83. FinBERT-based sentiment features marginally improve ranking but perform worse in classification, especially under class imbalance. SHAP analysis reveals that sparse, interpretable features align more closely with policy-relevant signals.
  These findings underscore the importance of integrating textual and structured signals transparently. For monetary policy forecasting, simpler hybrid models can offer both accuracy and interpretability, delivering actionable insights for researchers and decision-makers.

Abstract: Water consumption is an increasingly critical dimension of computing sustainability, especially as AI workloads rapidly scale. However, current water impact assessment often overlooks where and when water stress is more severe. To fill in this gap, we present SCARF, the first general framework that evaluates water impact of computing by factoring in both spatial and temporal variations in water stress. SCARF calculates an Adjusted Water Impact (AWI) metric that considers both consumption volume and local water stress over time. Through three case studies on LLM serving, datacenters, and semiconductor fabrication plants, we show the hidden opportunities for reducing water impact by optimizing location and time choices, paving the way for water-sustainable computing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning, most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU). CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined (removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft, and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum increase in average accuracy across 1.03%.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work, we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding \emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets. Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM); (2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15 datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24), 6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23).

Abstract: Discrete time stochastic optimal control problems and Markov decision processes (MDPs) are fundamental models for sequential decision-making under uncertainty and as such provide the mathematical framework underlying reinforcement learning theory. A central tool for solving MDPs is the Bellman equation and its solution, the so-called $Q$-function. In this article, we construct deep neural network (DNN) approximations for $Q$-functions associated to MDPs with infinite time horizon and finite control set $A$. More specifically, we show that if the the payoff function and the random transition dynamics of the MDP can be suitably approximated by DNNs with leaky rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, then the solutions $Q_d\colon \mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R^{|A|}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the associated Bellman equations can also be approximated in the $L^2$-sense by DNNs with leaky ReLU activation whose numbers of parameters grow at most polynomially in both the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ of the state space and the reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the prescribed error $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof relies on the recently introduced full-history recursive multilevel fixed-point (MLFP) approximation scheme.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures, enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently, inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids, and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper introduces TEDI (Truthful, Expressive, and Dimension-Insensitive approach), a discretization-free algorithm to learn truthful and utility-maximizing mechanisms. Existing learning-based approaches often rely on discretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to inefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we formalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes to prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can be equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The core idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial GroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally approximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we develop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous sampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental evaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves strong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.
  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without outcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency. The proposed concepts, network architecture, and learning techniques might offer potential value and provide new insights for automated mechanism design and differentiable economics.

Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design, characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation: proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical radar signal processing with automatic differentiation frameworks.

Abstract: With current advancement in hybermedia knowledges, the privacy of digital information has developed a critical problem. To overawed the susceptibilities of present security protocols, scholars tend to focus mainly on efforts on alternation of current protocols. Over past decade, various proposed encoding models have been shown insecurity, leading to main threats against significant data. Utilizing the suitable encryption model is very vital means of guard against various such, but algorithm is selected based on the dependency of data which need to be secured. Moreover, testing potentiality of the security assessment one by one to identify the best choice can take a vital time for processing. For faster and precisive identification of assessment algorithm, we suggest a security phase exposure model for cipher encryption technique by invoking Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this work, we form a dataset using usual security components like contrast, homogeneity. To overcome the uncertainty in analysing the security and lack of ability of processing data to a risk assessment mechanism. To overcome with such complications, this paper proposes an assessment model for security issues using fuzzy evidential reasoning (ER) approaches. Significantly, the model can be utilised to process and assemble risk assessment data on various aspects in systematic ways. To estimate the performance of our framework, we have various analyses like, recall, F1 score and accuracy.

Abstract: Scene categorization (SC) in remotely acquired images is an important subject with broad consequences in different fields, including catastrophe control, ecological observation, architecture for cities, and more. Nevertheless, its several apps, reaching a high degree of accuracy in SC from distant observation data has demonstrated to be difficult. This is because traditional conventional deep learning models require large databases with high variety and high levels of noise to capture important visual features. To address these problems, this investigation file introduces an innovative technique referred to as the Cuttlefish Optimized Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (CO- BRNN) for type of scenes in remote sensing data. The investigation compares the execution of CO-BRNN with current techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron- Convolutional Neural Network (MLP-CNN), Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), and Long Short Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (LSTM-CRF), Graph-Based (GB), Multilabel Image Retrieval Model (MIRM-CF), Convolutional Neural Networks Data Augmentation (CNN-DA). The results demonstrate that CO-BRNN attained the maximum accuracy of 97%, followed by LSTM-CRF with 90%, MLP-CNN with 85%, and CNN-LSTM with 80%. The study highlights the significance of physical confirmation to ensure the efficiency of satellite data.

Abstract: One of the most difficult challenges in cybersecurity is eliminating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Automating this task using artificial intelligence is a complex process due to the inherent class imbalance and lack of sufficient labeled samples of real-world datasets. This research investigates the use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to improve DDoS attack detection when data is imbalanced and partially labeled. In this process, 13 state-of-the-art SSL algorithms are evaluated for detecting DDoS attacks in several scenarios. We evaluate their practical efficacy and shortcomings, including the extent to which they work in extreme environments. The results will offer insight into designing intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are robust against class imbalance and handle partially labeled data.

Abstract: Cancer is a genetic disorder whose clonal evolution can be monitored by tracking noisy genome-wide copy number variants. We introduce the Copy Number Stochastic Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly clusters samples and genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using a bipartite categorical block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects the discrete nature of CNV calls and captures subpopulation-specific patterns through block-wise structure. Using a two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival analysis. These results establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable framework for CNV analysis with direct relevance for tumor heterogeneity and prognosis.

<title>ActAlign: Zero-Shot Fine-Grained Video Classification via Language-Guided Sequence Alignment</title>

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes. While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

<title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

<title>On Universality of Non-Separable Approximate Message Passing Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent, and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution. However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP algorithms employing these non-linearities.

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential for achieving these results.

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples, presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author, being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces' metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images are included for further analysis.

<title>Learning Counterfactually Decoupled Attention for Open-World Model Attribution</title>

arXiv:2506.23074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning (CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect. Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel attacks.

<title>CSBrain: A Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i) Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future brain-AI research.

Abstract: Online advertising in recommendation platforms has gained significant attention, with a predominant focus on channel recommendation and budget allocation strategies. However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards, simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation. Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the online digital realm, recommendation systems are ubiquitous and play a crucial role in enhancing user experience. These systems leverage user preferences to provide personalized recommendations, thereby helping users navigate through the paradox of choice. This work focuses on personalized sequential recommendation, where the system considers not only a user's immediate, evolving session context, but also their cumulative historical behavior to provide highly relevant and timely recommendations. Through an empirical study conducted on diverse real-world datasets, we have observed and quantified the existence and impact of both short-term (immediate and transient) and long-term (enduring and stable) preferences on users' historical interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that combines short- and long-term preferences to enhance recommendation performance, namely Compositions of Variant Experts (CoVE). This novel framework dynamically integrates short- and long-term preferences through the use of different specialized recommendation models (i.e., experts). Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods and ablation studies further investigate the impact of variant expert types.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes, highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements. First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use, traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature, which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media. The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.

<title>Aggregating Local Saliency Maps for Semi-Global Explainable Image Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.23247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However, reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights. SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and debugging image classifiers.

<title>Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively, where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods, showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color, shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The code is available atgithub.com/xmed-lab/TAM.

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language. Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative language models.

Abstract: We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state quantitative MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and (2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records (EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions. These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%, respectively.

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) methods generally assume that each document in a top-K ranking is presented in an equal format. However, previous work has shown that users' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e., allocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual or image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect attention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when scrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a fixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been addressed by existing LTR methods.
  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking task, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation length is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show that this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability ranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem cannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.
  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient estimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths. Our semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the expected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best performance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that even simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance improvements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and empirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining document presentation with LTR.

Abstract: The appearance of singularities in the function of interest constitutes a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. It can significantly undermine the effectiveness of numerical schemes for function approximation, numerical integration, and the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), etc. The problem becomes more sophisticated if the location of the singularity is unknown, which is often encountered in solving PDEs. Detecting the singularity is therefore critical for developing efficient adaptive methods to reduce computational costs in various applications. In this paper, we consider singularity detection in a purely data-driven setting. Namely, the input only contains given data, such as the vertex set from a mesh. To overcome the limitation of the raw unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for estimating the location of the singularity. A key component is a filtering procedure as the pretext task in SSL, where two filtering methods are presented, based on $k$ nearest neighbors and kernel density estimation, respectively. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the potential pathological or inaccurate results due to the use of raw data without filtering. Various experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to deal with input perturbation, label corruption, and different kinds of singularities such interior circle, boundary layer, concentric semicircles, etc.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is an emerging frontier in robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies. The Challenge Webpage is available at https://robotwin-benchmark.github.io/cvpr-2025-challenge/.

Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our insights on the underlying problem.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD (Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios. Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world deployment. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/VikramRangarajan/SIEDD .

Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge, hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful, randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings. Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational advantages, and applications to real-world data illustrate its practical utility.

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets in current language model research, characterizing them along several key dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward. All code, data, and detailed results are publicly available at https://github.com/vanbanTruong/Fairness-in-Large-Language-Models/tree/main/datasets to promote transparency and reproducibility across the research community.

<title>Detecting What Matters: A Novel Approach for Out-of-Distribution 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles</title>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless' based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel machine learning approach to compute the optimal transport map between two continuous distributions from their unpaired samples, based on the DeepParticle methods. The proposed method leads to a min-min optimization during training and does not impose any restriction on the network structure. Theoretically we establish a weak convergence guarantee and a quantitative error bound between the learned map and the optimal transport map. Our numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the new approach, particularly on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of input features differs between the training and testing phases. In covariate shift, estimating an unknown function's moment is a classical problem that remains under-explored, despite its common occurrence in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the minimax lower bound of the problem when the source and target distributions are known. To achieve the minimax optimal bound (up to a logarithmic factor), we propose a two-stage algorithm. Specifically, it first trains an optimal estimator for the function under the source distribution, and then uses a likelihood ratio reweighting procedure to calibrate the moment estimator. In practice, the source and target distributions are typically unknown, and estimating the likelihood ratio may be unstable. To solve this problem, we propose a truncated version of the estimator that ensures double robustness and provide the corresponding upper bound. Extensive numerical studies on synthetic examples confirm our theoretical findings and further illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<title>Sampling and Identity-Testing Without Approximate Tensorization of Entropy</title>

Abstract: Certain tasks in high-dimensional statistics become easier when the underlying distribution satisfies a local-to-global property called approximate tensorization of entropy (ATE). For example, the Glauber dynamics Markov chain of an ATE distribution mixes fast and can produce approximate samples in a small amount of time, since such a distribution satisfies a modified log-Sobolev inequality. Moreover, identity-testing for an ATE distribution requires few samples if the tester is given coordinate conditional access to the unknown distribution, as shown by Blanca, Chen, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and Vigoda (COLT 2023).
  A natural class of distributions that do not satisfy ATE consists of mixtures of (few) distributions that do satisfy ATE. We study the complexity of identity-testing and sampling for these distributions. Our main results are the following:
  1. We show fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization, with optimal sample complexity, for mixtures of distributions satisfying modified log-Sobolev inequalities. This extends work of Huang, Koehler, Lee, Mohanty, Rajaraman, Vuong, and Wu (STOC 2025, COLT 2025) for mixtures of distributions satisfying Poincar\'e inequalities.
  2. Answering an open question posed by Blanca et al., we give efficient identity-testers for mixtures of ATE distributions in the coordinate-conditional sampling access model. We also give some simplifications and improvements to the original algorithm of Blanca et al.

Abstract: Portable and wearable consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices, like Muse headbands, offer unprecedented mobility for daily brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, including cognitive load detection. However, the exacerbated non-stationarity in portable EEG signals constrains data fidelity and decoding accuracy, creating a fundamental trade-off between portability and performance. To mitigate such limitation, we propose MuseCogNet (Muse-based Cognitive Network), a unified joint learning framework integrating self-supervised and supervised training paradigms. In particular, we introduce an EEG-grounded self-supervised reconstruction loss based on average pooling to capture robust neurophysiological patterns, while cross-entropy loss refines task-specific cognitive discriminants. This joint learning framework resembles the bottom-up and top-down attention in humans, enabling MuseCogNet to significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available Muse dataset and establish an implementable pathway for neurocognitive monitoring in ecological settings.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel test for assessing partial effects in Frechet regression on Bures Wasserstein manifolds. Our approach employs a sample splitting strategy: the first subsample is used to fit the Frechet regression model, yielding estimates of the covariance matrices and their associated optimal transport maps, while the second subsample is used to construct the test statistic. We prove that this statistic converges in distribution to a weighted mixture of chi squared components, where the weights correspond to the eigenvalues of an integral operator defined by an appropriate RKHS kernel. We establish that our procedure achieves the nominal asymptotic size and demonstrate that its worst-case power converges uniformly to one. Through extensive simulations and a real data application, we illustrate the test's finite-sample accuracy and practical utility.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive performance even without source pretraining.

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture, closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a 76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage, preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

Abstract: Fixed points of recurrent neural networks can be leveraged to store and generate information. These fixed points can be captured by the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure, which leads to neural Langevin dynamics that can be used for sampling and learning a real dataset. We call this type of generative model neural Langevin machine, which is interpretable due to its analytic form of distribution and is simple to train. Moreover, the learning process is derived as a local asymmetric plasticity rule, bearing biological relevance. Therefore, one can realize a continuous sampling of creative dynamics in a neural network, mimicking an imagination process in brain circuits. This neural Langevin machine may be another promising generative model, at least in its strength in circuit-based sampling and biologically plausible learning rule.

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning. Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness, flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states (MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data. In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information, and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns, boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID and LPIPS.

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However, most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies, assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in complex, real-world scenarios.

<title>PBCAT: Patch-based composite adversarial training against physically realizable attacks on object detection</title>

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the $l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Abstract: Federated learning with secure aggregation enables private and collaborative learning from decentralised data without leaking sensitive client information. However, secure aggregation also complicates the detection of malicious client behaviour and the evaluation of individual client contributions to the learning. To address these challenges, QI (Pejo et al.) and FedGT (Xhemrishi et al.) were proposed for contribution evaluation (CE) and misbehaviour detection (MD), respectively. QI, however, lacks adequate MD accuracy due to its reliance on the random selection of clients in each training round, while FedGT lacks the CE ability. In this work, we combine the strengths of QI and FedGT to achieve both robust MD and accurate CE. Our experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to using either method independently.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of posterior drift on out-of-sample forecasting accuracy in overparametrized machine learning models. We document the loss in performance when the loadings of the data generating process change between the training and testing samples. This matters crucially in settings in which regime changes are likely to occur, for instance, in financial markets. Applied to equity premium forecasting, our results underline the sensitivity of a market timing strategy to sub-periods and to the bandwidth parameters that control the complexity of the model. For the average investor, we find that focusing on holding periods of 15 years can generate very heterogeneous returns, especially for small bandwidths. Large bandwidths yield much more consistent outcomes, but are far less appealing from a risk-adjusted return standpoint. All in all, our findings tend to recommend cautiousness when resorting to large linear models for stock market predictions.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets, and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

<title>Geminet: Learning the Duality-based Iterative Process for Lightweight Traffic Engineering in Changing Topologies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23640</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE), leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach, without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies, Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the 80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions, despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness, highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware robustness assessment.

<title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully open-sourced.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes. Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements. Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution, enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Abstract: Every publicly traded U.S. company files an annual 10-K report containing critical insights into financial health and risk. We propose Tiny eXplainable Risk Assessor (TinyXRA), a lightweight and explainable transformer-based model that automatically assesses company risk from these reports. Unlike prior work that relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for the Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and downside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio for more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to efficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic, attention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization while filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable deployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing capabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for production systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet loss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches in existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk differences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across seven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent and interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively by systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and qualitatively by examining explanation coherence. The paper concludes with findings, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions.

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts, enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers, the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable appears at most once in each equation.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage. Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for scalability in MAPF domains.

<title>Proving the Limited Scalability of Centralized Distributed Optimization via a New Lower Bound Construction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23836</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.23836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider centralized distributed optimization in the classical federated learning setup, where $n$ workers jointly find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point of an $L$-smooth, $d$-dimensional nonconvex function $f$, having access only to unbiased stochastic gradients with variance $\sigma^2$. Each worker requires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the communication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the server are $\tau_{s}$ and $\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One of the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability with respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed version of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L \Delta}{n \varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where $\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly, using unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the variance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term. However, once we account for the communication from the server to the workers $\tau_{s}$, we prove that it becomes infeasible to design a method using unbiased random sparsification compressors that scales both the server-side communication runtime term $\tau_{s} d \frac{L \Delta}{\varepsilon}$ and the variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L \Delta}{\varepsilon^2},$ better than poly-logarithmically in $n$, even in the homogeneous (i.i.d.) case, where all workers access the same distribution. To establish this result, we construct a new "worst-case" function and develop a new lower bound framework that reduces the analysis to the concentration of a random sum, for which we prove a concentration bound. These results reveal fundamental limitations in scaling distributed optimization, even under the homogeneous assumption.

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry, and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained. Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.

Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g., masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore, high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence modeling in MIR.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress, existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3% over the second best.

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide algorithm design.

Raw binaries were collected from sources such as VirusShare, VX Underground, and MalwareBazaar, and subsequently labeled with family information parsed from binary names and type-level labels integrated from ClarAVy. The dataset includes 14 malware types and 17 malware families, and was processed using a unified feature extraction pipeline based on static analysis, particularly extracting features from Portable Executable headers, to support advanced classification tasks. The evaluation was focused on three key classification tasks. In the binary classification of malware versus benign samples, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy on the full datasets, reaching 98.5% for type-based detection and 98.98% for family-based detection. When using truncated datasets of 1,000 samples to assess performance under limited data conditions, both models still performed strongly, achieving 97.6% for type-based detection and 98.66% for family-based detection. For interclass classification, which distinguishes between malware types or families, the models reached up to 97.5% accuracy on type-level tasks and up to 93.7% on family-level tasks. In the multiclass classification setting, which assigns samples to the correct type or family, SVM achieved 81.1% accuracy on type labels, while Random Forest and XGBoost reached approximately 73.4% on family labels. The results highlight practical trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, and demonstrate that labeling at both the type and family levels enables more fine-grained and insightful malware classification. The work establishes a robust foundation for future research on advanced malware detection and classification.

Abstract: Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from experimental radiographic images.

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed. To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither. sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their probabilistic internal knowledge.

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial chain.

Abstract: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below 1%.

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy: skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain) and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

<title>Learning Constraints Directly from Network Data</title>

Abstract: Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols, design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.
  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial search space.
  Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than 25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies, we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media. While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language, in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels, cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and generate new insights into the science communication process

Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice, also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.

Abstract: Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity. A key challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths. Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans. With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10% improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per inference.

Abstract: The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices introduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives. Reactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses, while proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing on-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently manage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade heterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces Agent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on memory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu first constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model kernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel annotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level preemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC utilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append proactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware dispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves 4.6$\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains 1.6$\times$-6.8$\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to state-of-the-art inference engines.

Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) has established itself as an efficient gradient-free optimization scheme, with attractive mathematical properties, such as mean-field convergence results for non-convex loss functions. In this work, we study CBO in the context of closed-box adversarial attacks, which are imperceptible input perturbations that aim to fool a classifier, without accessing its gradient. Our contribution is to establish a connection between the so-called consensus hopping as introduced by Riedl et al. and natural evolution strategies (NES) commonly applied in the context of adversarial attacks and to rigorously relate both methods to gradient-based optimization schemes. Beyond that, we provide a comprehensive experimental study that shows that despite the conceptual similarities, CBO can outperform NES and other evolutionary strategies in certain scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop" sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints, lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks. SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a widely studied model in the field of operations research for sequential decision making and reinforcement learning. This paper mainly considers the classical MAB model with the heavy-tailed reward distributions. We introduce the extended robust UCB policy, which is an extension of the pioneering UCB policies proposed by Bubeck et al. [5] and Lattimore [22]. The previous UCB policies require some strict conditions on the reward distributions, which can be hard to guarantee in practical scenarios. Our extended robust UCB generalizes Lattimore's seminary work (for moments of orders $p=4$ and $q=2$) to arbitrarily chosen $p>q>1$ as long as the two moments have a known controlled relationship, while still achieving the optimal regret growth order $O(log T)$, thus providing a broadened application area of the UCB policies for the heavy-tailed reward distributions. Furthermore, we achieve a near-optimal regret order without any knowledge of the reward distributions as long as their $p$-th moments exist for some $p>1$.

Abstract: We present Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC), a distributional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that combines the strengths of distributional information of accumulated rewards and entropy-driven exploration from Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DSAC models the randomness in both action and rewards, surpassing baseline performances on various continuous control tasks. Unlike standard approaches that solely maximize expected rewards, we propose a unified framework for risk-sensitive learning, one that optimizes the risk-related objective while balancing entropy to encourage exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate DSAC's effectiveness in enhancing agent performances for both risk-neutral and risk-sensitive control tasks.

Abstract: While existing federated learning approaches primarily focus on aggregating local models to construct a global model, in realistic settings, some clients may be reluctant to share their private models due to the inclusion of privacy-sensitive information. Knowledge distillation, which can extract model knowledge without accessing model parameters, is well-suited for this federated scenario. However, most distillation methods in federated learning (federated distillation) require a proxy dataset, which is difficult to obtain in the real world. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a distributed three-player Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to implement data-free mutual distillation and propose an effective method called FedDTG. We confirmed that the fake samples generated by GAN can make federated distillation more efficient and robust. Additionally, the distillation process between clients can deliver good individual client performance while simultaneously acquiring global knowledge and protecting data privacy. Our extensive experiments on benchmark vision datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other federated distillation algorithms in terms of generalization.

Abstract: Existing approaches to algorithmic fairness aim to ensure equitable outcomes if human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However, perfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable outcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that selective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative to the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes requires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure robustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We define the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that are guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the human's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to identify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy. However, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic recommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly fair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve the equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to enforce traditional algorithmic fairness constraints. We illustrate the value of our approach on criminal sentencing data before and after the introduction of an algorithmic risk assessment tool in Virginia.

Abstract: The delicate equilibrium between user privacy and the ability to unleash the potential of distributed data is an important concern. Federated learning, which enables the training of collaborative models without sharing of data, has emerged as a privacy-centric solution. This approach brings forth security challenges, notably poisoning and backdoor attacks where malicious entities inject corrupted data into the training process, as well as evasion attacks that aim to induce misclassifications at test time. Our research investigates the intersection of adversarial training, a common defense method against evasion attacks, and backdoor attacks within federated learning. We introduce Adversarial Robustness Unhardening (ARU), which is employed by a subset of adversarial clients to intentionally undermine model robustness during federated training, rendering models susceptible to a broader range of evasion attacks. We present extensive experiments evaluating ARU's impact on adversarial training and existing robust aggregation defenses against poisoning and backdoor attacks. Our results show that ARU can substantially undermine adversarial training's ability to harden models against test-time evasion attacks, and that adversaries employing ARU can even evade robust aggregation defenses that often neutralize poisoning or backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Once deployed, medical image analysis methods are often faced with unexpected image corruptions and noise perturbations. These unknown covariate shifts present significant challenges to deep learning based methods trained on "clean" images. This often results in unreliable predictions and poorly calibrated confidence, hence hindering clinical applicability. While recent methods have been developed to address specific issues such as confidence calibration or adversarial robustness, no single framework effectively tackles all these challenges simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose LaDiNE, a novel ensemble learning method combining the robustness of Vision Transformers with diffusion-based generative models for improved reliability in medical image classification. Specifically, transformer encoder blocks are used as hierarchical feature extractors that learn invariant features from images for each ensemble member, resulting in features that are robust to input perturbations. In addition, diffusion models are used as flexible density estimators to estimate member densities conditioned on the invariant features, leading to improved modeling of complex data distributions while retaining properly calibrated confidence. Extensive experiments on tuberculosis chest X-rays and melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that LaDiNE achieves superior performance compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art methods by simultaneously improving prediction accuracy and confidence calibration under unseen noise, adversarial perturbations, and resolution degradation.

Abstract: Video games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision-making community, but going beyond Atari games towards modern games has been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research community. Prior work in modern video games typically relied on game-specific integration to obtain game features and enable online training, or on existing large datasets. An alternative approach is to train agents using imitation learning to play video games purely from images. However, this setting poses a fundamental question: which visual encoders obtain representations that retain information critical for decision making? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic study of imitation learning with publicly available pre-trained visual encoders compared to the typical task-specific end-to-end training approach in Minecraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Minecraft Dungeons. Our results show that end-to-end training can be effective with comparably low-resolution images and only minutes of demonstrations, but significant improvements can be gained by utilising pre-trained encoders such as DINOv2 depending on the game. In addition to enabling effective decision making, we show that pre-trained encoders can make decision-making research in video games more accessible by significantly reducing the cost of training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advancements in node classification, but their success relies on sufficient labeled nodes per class in the training data. Real-world graph data often exhibits a long-tail distribution with sparse labels, emphasizing the importance of GNNs' ability in few-shot node classification, which entails categorizing nodes with limited data. Traditional episodic meta-learning approaches have shown promise in this domain, but they face an inherent limitation: it might lead the model to converge to suboptimal solutions because of random and uniform task assignment, ignoring task difficulty levels. This could lead the meta-learner to face complex tasks too soon, hindering proper learning. Ideally, the meta-learner should start with simple concepts and advance to more complex ones, like human learning. So, we introduce CPT, a novel two-stage curriculum learning method that aligns task difficulty with the meta-learner's progressive competence, enhancing overall performance. Specifically, in CPT's initial stage, the focus is on simpler tasks, fostering foundational skills for engaging with complex tasks later. Importantly, the second stage dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on the meta-learner's growing competence, aiming for optimal knowledge acquisition. Extensive experiments on popular node classification datasets demonstrate significant improvements of our strategy over existing methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in learning node representations and have shown strong performance in tasks such as node classification. However, recent findings indicate that the presence of noise in real-world graph data can substantially impair the effectiveness of GNNs. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust and innovative node representation learning method named Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization, or GCL-LRR, which follows a two-stage transductive learning framework for node classification. In the first stage, the GCL-LRR encoder is optimized through prototypical contrastive learning while incorporating a low-rank regularization objective. In the second stage, the representations generated by GCL-LRR are employed by a linear transductive classifier to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes within the graph. Our GCL-LRR is inspired by the Low Frequency Property (LFP) of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank regularization in transductive learning, which is also supported by strong empirical results. To further enhance the performance of GCL-LRR, we present an improved model named GCL-LR-Attention, which incorporates a novel LR-Attention layer into GCL-LRR. GCL-LR-Attention reduces the kernel complexity of GCL-LRR and contributes to a tighter generalization bound, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets evidence the effectiveness and robustness of both GCL-LRR and GCL-LR-Attention in learning meaningful node representations. The code is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/GCL-LR-Attention.

Abstract: When deploying time series forecasting models based on machine learning to real world settings, one often encounter situations where the data distribution drifts. Such drifts expose the forecasting models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and machine learning models lack robustness in these settings. Robustness can be improved by using deep generative models or genetic algorithms to augment time series datasets, but these approaches lack interpretability and are computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable and simple framework for generating time series. Our method combines time-series decompositions with analytic functions, and is able to generate time series with characteristics matching both in- and out-of-distribution data. This approach allows users to generate new time series in an interpretable fashion, which can be used to augment the dataset and improve forecasting robustness. We demonstrate our framework through EXPRTS, a visual analytics tool designed for univariate time series forecasting models and datasets. Different visualizations of the data distribution, forecasting errors and single time series instances enable users to explore time series datasets, apply transformations, and evaluate forecasting model robustness across diverse scenarios. We show how our framework can generate meaningful OOD time series that improve model robustness, and we validate EXPRTS effectiveness and usability through three use-cases and a user study.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved tremendous success. However, unlike SVMs, which provide direct decision criteria and can be trained with a small dataset, it still has significant weaknesses due to its requirement for massive datasets during training and the black-box characteristics on decision criteria. This paper addresses these issues by identifying support vectors in deep learning models. To this end, we propose the DeepKKT condition, an adaptation of the traditional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition for deep learning models, and confirm that generated Deep Support Vectors (DSVs) using this condition exhibit properties similar to traditional support vectors. This allows us to apply our method to few-shot dataset distillation problems and alleviate the black-box characteristics of deep learning models. Additionally, we demonstrate that the DeepKKT condition can transform conventional classification models into generative models with high fidelity, particularly as latent generative models using class labels as latent variables. We validate the effectiveness of DSVs using common datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) on the general architectures (ResNet and ConvNet), proving their practical applicability.

Abstract: Generative AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in creative fields, sparking urgent debates over how current copyright laws can keep pace with technological innovation. Recent controversies of AI models generating near-replicas of copyrighted material highlight the need to adapt current legal frameworks and develop technical methods to mitigate copyright infringement risks. This task requires understanding the intersection between computational concepts such as large-scale data scraping and probabilistic content generation, legal definitions of originality and fair use, and economic impacts on IP rights holders. However, most existing research on copyright in AI takes a purely computer science or law-based approach, leaving a gap in coordinating these approaches that only multidisciplinary efforts can effectively address. To bridge this gap, our survey adopts a comprehensive approach synthesizing insights from law, policy, economics, and computer science. It begins by discussing the foundational goals and considerations that should be applied to copyright in generative AI, followed by methods for detecting and assessing potential violations in AI system outputs. Next, it explores various regulatory options influenced by legal, policy, and economic frameworks to manage and mitigate copyright concerns associated with generative AI and reconcile the interests of IP rights holders with that of generative AI producers. The discussion then introduces techniques to safeguard individual creative works from unauthorized replication, such as watermarking and cryptographic protections. Finally, it describes advanced training strategies designed to prevent AI models from reproducing protected content. In doing so, we highlight key opportunities for action and offer actionable strategies that creators, developers, and policymakers can use in navigating the evolving copyright landscape.

<title>Robustness of Decentralised Learning to Nodes and Data Disruption</title>

Abstract: In the vibrant landscape of AI research, decentralised learning is gaining momentum. Decentralised learning allows individual nodes to keep data locally where they are generated and to share knowledge extracted from local data among themselves through an interactive process of collaborative refinement. This paradigm supports scenarios where data cannot leave local nodes due to privacy or sovereignty reasons or real-time constraints imposing proximity of models to locations where inference has to be carried out. The distributed nature of decentralised learning implies significant new research challenges with respect to centralised learning. Among them, in this paper, we focus on robustness issues. Specifically, we study the effect of nodes' disruption on the collective learning process. Assuming a given percentage of "central" nodes disappear from the network, we focus on different cases, characterised by (i) different distributions of data across nodes and (ii) different times when disruption occurs with respect to the start of the collaborative learning task. Through these configurations, we are able to show the non-trivial interplay between the properties of the network connecting nodes, the persistence of knowledge acquired collectively before disruption or lack thereof, and the effect of data availability pre- and post-disruption. Our results show that decentralised learning processes are remarkably robust to network disruption. As long as even minimum amounts of data remain available somewhere in the network, the learning process is able to recover from disruptions and achieve significant classification accuracy. This clearly varies depending on the remaining connectivity after disruption, but we show that even nodes that remain completely isolated can retain significant knowledge acquired before the disruption.

Abstract: In recent years, inconsistency in Bayesian deep learning has attracted significant attention. Tempered or generalized posterior distributions are frequently employed as direct and effective solutions. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of generalized posteriors remain active research topics. In this work, we interpret posterior tempering as a correction for model misspecification via adjustments to the joint probability, and as a recalibration of priors by reducing aleatoric uncertainty. We also identify a unique property of the Laplace approximation: the generalized normalizing constant remains invariant, in contrast to general Bayesian learning, where this constant typically depends on model parameters after generalization. Leveraging this property, we introduce the generalized Laplace approximation, which requires only a simple modification to the Hessian calculation of the regularized loss. This approach provides a flexible and scalable framework for high-quality posterior inference. We evaluate the proposed method on state-of-the-art neural networks and real-world datasets, demonstrating that the generalized Laplace approximation enhances predictive performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based neural networks, empowered by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), have demonstrated unprecedented performance across various domains. However, related literature suggests that tabular Transformers may struggle to outperform classical Machine Learning algorithms, such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT). In this paper, we aim to challenge GBDTs with tabular Transformers on a typical task faced in e-commerce, namely fraud detection. Our study is additionally motivated by the problem of selection bias, often occurring in real-life fraud detection systems. It is caused by the production system affecting which subset of traffic becomes labeled. This issue is typically addressed by sampling randomly a small part of the whole production data, referred to as a Control Group. This subset follows a target distribution of production data and therefore is usually preferred for training classification models with standard ML algorithms. Our methodology leverages the capabilities of Transformers to learn transferable representations using all available data by means of SSL, giving it an advantage over classical methods. Furthermore, we conduct large-scale experiments, pre-training tabular Transformers on vast amounts of data instances and fine-tuning them on smaller target datasets. The proposed approach outperforms heavily tuned GBDTs by a considerable margin of the Average Precision (AP) score in offline evaluations. Finally, we report the results of an online A/B experiment. Experimental results confirm the superiority of tabular Transformers compared to GBDTs in production, demonstrated by a statistically significant improvement in our business metric.

Abstract: User data spread across multiple modalities has popularized multi-modal recommender systems (MMRS). They recommend diverse content such as products, social media posts, TikTok reels, etc., based on a user-item interaction graph. With rising data privacy demands, recent methods propose unlearning private user data from uni-modal recommender systems (RS). However, methods for unlearning item data related to outdated user preferences, revoked licenses, and legally requested removals are still largely unexplored.
  Previous RS unlearning methods are unsuitable for MMRS due to the incompatibility of their matrix-based representation with the multi-modal user-item interaction graph. Moreover, their data partitioning step degrades performance on each shard due to poor data heterogeneity and requires costly performance aggregation across shards.
  This paper introduces MMRecUn, the first approach known to us for unlearning in MMRS and unlearning item data. Given a trained RS model, MMRecUn employs a novel Reverse Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) objective to enable the model to forget marked data. The reverse BPR attenuates the impact of user-item interactions within the forget set, while the forward BPR reinforces the significance of user-item interactions within the retain set. Our experiments demonstrate that MMRecUn outperforms baseline methods across various unlearning requests when evaluated on benchmark MMRS datasets. MMRecUn achieves recall performance improvements of up to 49.85% compared to baseline methods and is up to 1.3x faster than the Gold model, which is trained on retain set from scratch. MMRecUn offers significant advantages, including superiority in removing target interactions, preserving retained interactions, and zero overhead costs compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series plays a vital role in ensuring the stable operation of complex systems. Traditional methods often assume that normal data follow a single Gaussian distribution and identify anomalies as deviations from this distribution. {\color{black} However, this simplified assumption fails to capture the diversity and structural complexity of real-world time series, which can lead to misjudgments and reduced detection performance in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method that combines a neighborhood-driven data augmentation strategy with a multi-manifold representation learning framework.} By incorporating information from local neighborhoods, the augmentation module can simulate contextual variations of normal data, enhancing the model's adaptability to distributional changes. In addition, we design a structure-aware feature learning approach that encourages natural clustering of similar patterns in the feature space while maintaining sufficient distinction between different operational states. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong potential for generalization and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software systems has significantly enhanced their capabilities while escalating energy demands. Ensemble learning, combining predictions from multiple models to form a single prediction, intensifies this problem due to cumulative energy consumption. This paper presents a novel approach to model selection that addresses the challenge of balancing the accuracy of AI models with their energy consumption in a live AI ensemble system. We explore how reducing the number of models or improving the efficiency of model usage within an ensemble during inference can reduce energy demands without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This study introduces and evaluates two model selection strategies, Static and Dynamic, for optimizing ensemble learning systems performance while minimizing energy usage. Our results demonstrate that the Static strategy improves the F1 score beyond the baseline, reducing average energy usage from 100% from the full ensemble to 62%. The Dynamic strategy further enhances F1 scores, using on average 76% compared to 100% of the full ensemble. Moreover, we propose an approach that balances accuracy with resource consumption, significantly reducing energy usage without substantially impacting accuracy. This method decreased the average energy usage of the Static strategy from approximately 62% to 14%, and for the Dynamic strategy, from around 76% to 57%. Our field study of Green AI using an operational AI system developed by a large professional services provider shows the practical applicability of adopting energy-conscious model selection strategies in live production environments.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of machine learning models in network security threat detection through the critical lens of partial versus complete flow information, addressing a common gap between research settings and real-time operational needs. We systematically evaluate how a standard benchmark model, Random Forest, performs under varying training and testing conditions (complete/complete, partial/partial, complete/partial), quantifying the performance impact when dealing with the incomplete data typical in real-time environments. Our findings demonstrate a significant performance difference, with precision and recall dropping by up to 30% under certain conditions when models trained on complete flows are tested against partial flows. The study also reveals that, for the evaluated dataset and model, a minimum threshold around 7 packets in the test set appears necessary for maintaining reliable detection rates, providing valuable, quantified insights for developing more realistic real-time detection strategies.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows participants to collaboratively train machine learning models while keeping their data local, making it ideal for collaborations among healthcare institutions on sensitive data. However, in this paper, we propose a novel privacy attack called MedLeak, which allows a malicious FL server to recover high-quality site-specific private medical data from the client model updates. MedLeak works by introducing an adversarially crafted model during the FL training process. Honest clients, unaware of the insidious changes in the published models, continue to send back their updates as per the standard FL protocol. Leveraging a novel analytical method, MedLeak can efficiently recover private client data from the aggregated parameter updates, eliminating costly optimization. In addition, the scheme relies solely on the aggregated updates, thus rendering secure aggregation protocols ineffective, as they depend on the randomization of intermediate results for security while leaving the final aggregated results unaltered.
  We implement MedLeak on medical image datasets (MedMNIST, COVIDx CXR-4, and Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI), as well as a medical text dataset (MedAbstract). The results demonstrate that our attack achieves high recovery rates and strong quantitative scores on both image and text datasets. We also thoroughly evaluate MedLeak across different attack parameters, providing insights into key factors that influence attack performance and potential defenses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the recovered data can support downstream tasks such as disease classification with minimal performance loss. Our findings validate the need for enhanced privacy measures in FL systems, particularly for safeguarding sensitive medical data against powerful model inversion attacks.

Abstract: Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique "squeezing effect" to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.

<title>Remove Symmetries to Control Model Expressivity and Improve Optimization</title>

Abstract: When symmetry is present in the loss function, the model is likely to be trapped in a low-capacity state that is sometimes known as a "collapse". Being trapped in these low-capacity states can be a major obstacle to training across many scenarios where deep learning technology is applied. We first prove two concrete mechanisms through which symmetries lead to reduced capacities and ignored features during training and inference. We then propose a simple and theoretically justified algorithm, syre, to remove almost all symmetry-induced low-capacity states in neural networks. When this type of entrapment is especially a concern, removing symmetries with the proposed method is shown to correlate well with improved optimization or performance. A remarkable merit of the proposed method is that it is model-agnostic and does not require any knowledge of the symmetry.

Abstract: Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (e.g., observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, inspired by physical systems, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model, which combines the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified mathematical framework for common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLPs, GNNs, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers, whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning methods for movement recognition often struggle with limited model interpretability and a lack of insight into human movement dynamics. This study introduces a novel representation learning framework based on causal inference to address these challenges. Our two-stage approach combines the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to identify and quantify causal relationships between human joints. By capturing joint interactions, the proposed causal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) produces interpretable and robust representations. Experimental results on the EmoPain dataset demonstrate that the causal GCN outperforms traditional GCNs in accuracy, F1 score, and recall, particularly in detecting protective behaviors. This work contributes to advancing human motion analysis and lays a foundation for adaptive and intelligent healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of particular data points from the learnable parameters of a trained machine learning model. This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations, which are tiny changes to the input data that appear insignificant but cause the model to produce drastically different outputs. Many defense methods require modifying model architectures during evaluation or performing test-time data purification. This not only introduces additional complexity but is often architecture-dependent. We show, however, that robust feature learning during training can significantly enhance DNN robustness. We propose MOREL, a multi-objective approach that aligns natural and adversarial features using cosine similarity and multi-positive contrastive losses to encourage similar features for same-class inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOREL significantly improves robustness against both white-box and black-box attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/salomonhotegni/MOREL

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) plays a crucial role in various fields, including data engineering and visualization, by simplifying complex datasets while retaining essential information. However, achieving both high DR accuracy and strong explainability remains a fundamental challenge, especially for users dealing with high-dimensional data. Traditional DR methods often face a trade-off between precision and transparency, where optimizing for performance can lead to reduced explainability, and vice versa. This limitation is especially prominent in real-world applications such as image, tabular, and text data analysis, where both accuracy and explainability are critical. To address these challenges, this work introduces the MOE-based Explainable Deep Manifold Transformation (DMT-ME). The proposed approach combines hyperbolic embeddings, which effectively capture complex hierarchical structures, with Mixture of Experts (MOE) models, which dynamically allocate tasks based on input features. DMT-ME enhances DR accuracy by leveraging hyperbolic embeddings to represent the hierarchical nature of data, while also improving explainability by explicitly linking input data, embedding outcomes, and key features through the MOE structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMT-ME consistently achieves superior performance in both DR accuracy and model explainability, making it a robust solution for complex data analysis.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression remains an NP-Hard problem, with extensive research focusing on AI models for this task. Transformer models have shown promise in Symbolic Regression, but performance suffers with smaller datasets. We propose applying k-fold cross-validation to a transformer-based symbolic regression model trained on a significantly reduced dataset (15,000 data points, down from 500,000). This technique partitions the training data into multiple subsets (folds), iteratively training on some while validating on others. Our aim is to provide an estimate of model generalization and mitigate overfitting issues associated with smaller datasets. Results show that this process improves the model's output consistency and generalization by a relative improvement in validation loss of 53.31%. Potentially enabling more efficient and accessible symbolic regression in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales, ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations more effectively. We provide theoretical insight through heat equation analysis on a simplified diffusion model, demonstrating how graph Laplacian eigenvalues can determine temporal dynamics scales, and crucially validate this correspondence through comprehensive empirical analysis on real molecular dynamics trajectories showing quantitative spatial-temporal correlations across diverse molecular systems. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.

Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.

<title>Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity</title>

Abstract: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.

Abstract: Pretrained foundation models and transformer architectures have driven the success of large language models (LLMs) and other modern AI breakthroughs. However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research.

Abstract: Adversarial examples usually exhibit good cross-model transferability, enabling attacks on black-box models with limited information about their architectures and parameters, which are highly threatening in commercial black-box scenarios. Model ensembling is an effective strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by attacking multiple surrogate models. However, since prior studies usually adopt few models in the ensemble, there remains an open question of whether scaling the number of models can further improve black-box attacks. Inspired by the scaling law of large foundation models, we investigate the scaling laws of black-box adversarial attacks in this work. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we conclude with clear scaling laws that using more surrogate models enhances adversarial transferability. Comprehensive experiments verify the claims on standard image classifiers, diverse defended models and multimodal large language models using various adversarial attack methods. Specifically, by scaling law, we achieve 90%+ transfer attack success rate on even proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further visualization indicates that there is also a scaling law on the interpretability and semantics of adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants are increasingly recognized as promising candidates for machine learning applications, due to their societal importance and high availability of data. However, their varied designs, operational conditions, and influent characteristics hinder straightforward automation. In this study, we use data from a pilot reactor at the Veas treatment facility in Norway to explore how machine learning can be used to optimize biological nitrate ($\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) reduction to molecular nitrogen ($\mathrm{N_2}$) in the biogeochemical process known as \textit{denitrification}. Rather than focusing solely on predictive accuracy, our approach prioritizes understanding the foundational requirements for effective data-driven modelling of wastewater treatment. Specifically, we aim to identify which process parameters are most critical, the necessary data quantity and quality, how to structure data effectively, and what properties are required by the models. We find that nonlinear models perform best on the training and validation data sets, indicating nonlinear relationships to be learned, but linear models transfer better to the unseen test data, which comes later in time. The variable measuring the water temperature has a particularly detrimental effect on the models, owing to a significant change in distributions between training and test data. We therefore conclude that multiple years of data is necessary to learn robust machine learning models. By addressing foundational elements, particularly in the context of the climatic variability faced by northern regions, this work lays the groundwork for a more structured and tailored approach to machine learning for wastewater treatment. We share publicly both the data and code used to produce the results in the paper.

Abstract: The ideas of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are widely used to reason about the probabilistic predictions of machine-learning models. We identify incoherence in existing discussions of these ideas and suggest this stems from the aleatoric-epistemic view being insufficiently expressive to capture all the distinct quantities that researchers are interested in. To address this we present a decision-theoretic perspective that relates rigorous notions of uncertainty, predictive performance and statistical dispersion in data. This serves to support clearer thinking as the field moves forward. Additionally we provide insights into popular information-theoretic quantities, showing they can be poor estimators of what they are often purported to measure, while also explaining how they can still be useful in guiding data acquisition.

Abstract: This research provides an in-depth evaluation of various machine learning models for energy forecasting, focusing on the unique challenges of seasonal variations in student residential settings. The study assesses the performance of baseline models, such as LSTM and GRU, alongside state-of-the-art forecasting methods, including Autoregressive Feedforward Neural Networks, Transformers, and hybrid approaches. Special attention is given to predicting energy consumption amidst challenges like seasonal patterns, vacations, meteorological changes, and irregular human activities that cause sudden fluctuations in usage. The findings reveal that no single model consistently outperforms others across all seasons, emphasizing the need for season-specific model selection or tailored designs. Notably, the proposed Hyper Network based LSTM and MiniAutoEncXGBoost models exhibit strong adaptability to seasonal variations, effectively capturing abrupt changes in energy consumption during summer months. This study advances the energy forecasting field by emphasizing the critical role of seasonal dynamics and model-specific behavior in achieving accurate predictions.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm that exploits supervisory signals generated from the data itself, and many recent studies have leveraged SSL to conduct graph anomaly detection. However, we empirically found that three important factors can substantially impact detection performance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the tuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination weights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection methods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by label information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and combination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance, using label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage and leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been criticized as "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", yet many recent studies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information to select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an internal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select hyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection. We perform extensive experiments using 10 recent SSL-based graph anomaly detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating both the prior issues with hyperparameter selection and the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.

Abstract: Modeling spatial heterogeneity in the data generation process is essential for understanding and predicting geographical phenomena. Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural networks. However, current geographically weighting approaches are ineffective on graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We assume the crux lies in the over-fitting risk brought by a large number of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of county-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an exploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of non-linear relationships through ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN. Our work contributes to the practice of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in tackling spatial heterogeneity.

We implement both unconditional and conditional VAEs, trained on experimental data from two variants of a fully electric SUV with differing torque and drivetrain configurations. The VAEs synthesize jerk signals that capture characteristics from multiple drivetrain scenarios by leveraging the learned latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs, without requiring detailed system parametrization. Unconditional VAEs generate realistic jerk signals without prior system knowledge, while conditional VAEs enable the generation of signals tailored to specific torque inputs. This approach reduces the dependence on costly and time-intensive real-world experiments and extensive manual modeling. The results support the integration of generative models such as VAEs into drivetrain simulation pipelines, both for data augmentation and for efficient exploration of complex operational scenarios, with the potential to streamline validation and accelerate vehicle development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.

<title>Faster Convergence of Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent with Increasing Batch Size</title>

Abstract: We have theoretically analyzed the use of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) and found that using an increasing batch size leads to faster RSGD convergence rate than using a constant batch size not only with a constant learning rate but also with a decaying learning rate, such as cosine annealing decay and polynomial decay. The convergence rate of RSGD improves from $O(\sqrt{T^{-1}+\text{const.}})$ with a constant batch size to $O(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ with an increasing batch size, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. Using principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion tasks, we investigated, both theoretically and numerically, how increasing batch size affects computational time as measured by stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Increasing batch size reduces the SFO complexity of RSGD. Furthermore, our numerical results demonstrated that increasing batch size offers the advantages of both small and large constant batch sizes.

<title>Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy</title>

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their high computational and memory costs hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binarization, which reduces model weights to 1 bit, is a promising solution for efficient inference. However, binarized LLMs still exhibit redundancy that can be further compressed. Semi-structured pruning offers a favorable trade-off between model performance and hardware efficiency, but naively combining it with binarization often leads to severe performance degradation. To address this, we propose Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning (PBS$^2$P), a novel post-training compression framework. We propose Stepwise semi-structured Pruning with Binarization Optimization (SPBO) to jointly reduce pruning and binarization error. Additionally, we develop a Coarse-to-Fine Search (CFS) strategy to more effectively select pruning elements. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that PBS$^2$P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art binary post-training quantization methods in both perplexity and downstream accuracy. The code and models will be available at: https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PBS2P.

Abstract: Projection Pursuit is a classic exploratory technique for finding interesting projections of a dataset. We propose a method for recovering projections containing either Imbalanced Clusters or a Bernoulli-Rademacher distribution using a gradient-based technique to optimize the projection index. As sample complexity is a major limiting factor in Projection Pursuit, we analyze our algorithm's sample complexity within a Planted Vector setting where we can observe that Imbalanced Clusters can be recovered more easily than balanced ones. Additionally, we give a generalized result that works for a variety of data distributions and projection indices. We compare these results to computational lower bounds in the Low-Degree-Polynomial Framework. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our method's applicability to real-world data using FashionMNIST and the Human Activity Recognition Dataset, where our algorithm outperforms others when only a few samples are available.

<title>Time to Rethink AI for Combinatorial Optimization: Classical Algorithms Remain Tough to Match</title>

Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community should fundamentally rethink how AI-inspired methods are developed and evaluated for combinatorial optimization (CO). We present comprehensive empirical benchmarks comparing various recent AI-inspired GPU-based methods with several classical CPU-based solvers on the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Strikingly, even on in-distribution random graphs, leading AI-inspired methods are consistently outperformed by the state-of-the-art classical solver KaMIS, and some AI-inspired methods frequently fail to surpass even the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic. To better understand the source of these failures, we introduce a novel analysis, serialization, which reveals that non-backtracking AI methods, such as LTFT (based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy heuristic, and thus worse than KaMIS.
  Our findings reveal three core issues: (1) Limited benchmarks and evaluation - AI-inspired methods are often tested only on small instances with very limited inference time, which covers up issues with scalability and resource usage; (2) Intrinsic hardness and learning limits - even under ideal, in-distribution conditions, learning-based approaches lag behind classical heuristics, highlighting inherent barriers that receive little attention; and (3) Insufficient use and understanding of classical heuristics - current learning frameworks often neglect to incorporate effective classical techniques.
  Although we use MIS as a testbed, similar gaps and challenges have been reported in other combinatorial optimization problems, suggesting broader relevance for our recommendations. We propose that future research must address these issues by rigorous benchmarking, deepening understanding of learning limitations, and integrating classical heuristics into AI-inspired methods.

Abstract: In overparameterized logistic regression, gradient descent (GD) iterates diverge in norm while converging in direction to the maximum $\ell_2$-margin solution -- a phenomenon known as the implicit bias of GD. This work investigates additional regularization effects induced by early stopping in well-specified high-dimensional logistic regression. We first demonstrate that the excess logistic risk vanishes for early-stopped GD but diverges to infinity for GD iterates at convergence. This suggests that early-stopped GD is well-calibrated, whereas asymptotic GD is statistically inconsistent. Second, we show that to attain a small excess zero-one risk, polynomially many samples are sufficient for early-stopped GD, while exponentially many samples are necessary for any interpolating estimator, including asymptotic GD. This separation underscores the statistical benefits of early stopping in the overparameterized regime. Finally, we establish nonasymptotic bounds on the norm and angular differences between early-stopped GD and $\ell_2$-regularized empirical risk minimizer, thereby connecting the implicit regularization of GD with explicit $\ell_2$-regularization.

Abstract: Accurate identification of bioactive peptides (BPs) and protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) is essential for understanding protein function and advancing therapeutic discovery. However, most computational methods remain limited in their generalizability across diverse peptide functions. Here, we present PDeepPP, a unified deep learning framework that integrates pretrained protein language models with a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture, enabling robust identification across diverse peptide classes and PTM sites. We curated comprehensive benchmark datasets and implemented strategies to address data imbalance, allowing PDeepPP to systematically extract both global and local sequence features. Through extensive analyses-including dimensionality reduction and comparison studies-PDeepPP demonstrates strong, interpretable peptide representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 25 of the 33 biological identification tasks. Notably, PDeepPP attains high accuracy in antimicrobial (0.9726) and phosphorylation site (0.9984) identification, with 99.5% specificity in glycosylation site prediction and substantial reduction in false negatives in antimalarial tasks. By enabling large-scale, accurate peptide analysis, PDeepPP supports biomedical research and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for disease treatment. All code, datasets, and pretrained models are publicly available via GitHub:https://github.com/fondress/PDeepPP and Hugging Face:https://huggingface.co/fondress/PDeppPP.

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism (PP) is widely used for training large language models (LLMs), yet its scalability is often constrained by high activation memory consumption as the number of in-flight microbatches grows with the degree of PP. In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by leveraging the under-explored memory offload strategy in PP. With empirical study, we discover that in the majority of standard configurations, at least half, and potentially all, of the activations can be offloaded with negligible overhead. In the cases where full overload is not possible, we introduce a novel selective offload strategy that decreases peak activation memory in a better-than-linear manner. Furthermore, we integrate memory offload with other techniques to jointly consider overall throughput and memory limitation. Our experiments proves that the per-device activation memory effectively reduces with the total number of stages, making PP a stronger alternative than TP, offering up to a 19\% acceleration with even lower memory consumption. The implementation is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/sail-sg/zero-bubble-pipeline-parallelism}{this url}.

Abstract: Model merging is a technique that combines multiple finetuned models into a single model without additional training, allowing a free-rider to cheaply inherit specialized capabilities. This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have emerged as a leading architecture for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation tasks. A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences.
  In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units.
  Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly operate in Real-world environments, the integration of multi-modal data sources such as vision, language, and audio presents both unprecedented opportunities and critical challenges for achieving trustworthy intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies federated learning with explainable multi-modal reasoning to ensure trustworthiness in decentralized, dynamic settings. Our approach, called FedMM-X (Federated Multi-Modal Explainable Intelligence), leverages cross-modal consistency checks, client-level interpretability mechanisms, and dynamic trust calibration to address challenges posed by data heterogeneity, modality imbalance, and out-of-distribution generalization. Through rigorous evaluation across federated multi-modal benchmarks involving vision-language tasks, we demonstrate improved performance in both accuracy and interpretability while reducing vulnerabilities to adversarial and spurious correlations. Further, we introduce a novel trust score aggregation method to quantify global model reliability under dynamic client participation. Our findings pave the way toward developing robust, interpretable, and socially responsible AI systems in Real-world environments.

Abstract: ML-supported decisions, such as ordering tests or determining preventive custody, often involve binary classification based on probabilistic forecasts. Evaluation frameworks for such forecasts typically consider whether to prioritize independent-decision metrics (e.g., Accuracy) or top-K metrics (e.g., Precision@K), and whether to focus on fixed thresholds or threshold-agnostic measures like AUC-ROC. We highlight that a consequentialist perspective, long advocated by decision theorists, should naturally favor evaluations that support independent decisions using a mixture of thresholds given their prevalence, such as Brier scores and Log loss. However, our empirical analysis reveals a strong preference for top-K metrics or fixed thresholds in evaluations at major conferences like ICML, FAccT, and CHIL. To address this gap, we use this decision-theoretic framework to map evaluation metrics to their optimal use cases, along with a Python package, briertools, to promote the broader adoption of Brier scores. In doing so, we also uncover new theoretical connections, including a reconciliation between the Brier Score and Decision Curve Analysis, which clarifies and responds to a longstanding critique by (Assel, et al. 2017) regarding the clinical utility of proper scoring rules.

Abstract: Quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1-bit precision significantly reduces computational costs, but existing quantization techniques suffer from noticeable performance degradation when using weight and activation precisions below 4 bits (W4A4). In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1*4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 * INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks, pushing the boundaries of existing LLM quantization methods toward fully binarized models.

Abstract: From clinical dosing algorithms to autonomous robots, sequential decision-making systems routinely operate with missing or incomplete data. Classical reinforcement learning theory, which is commonly used to solve sequential decision problems, assumes Markovian observability, which may not hold under partial observability. Causal inference paradigms formalise ignorability of missingness. We show these views can be unified and generalized in order to guarantee Q-learning convergence even when the Markov property fails. To do so, we introduce the concept of \emph{relative ignorability}. Relative ignorability is a graphical-causal criterion which refines the requirements for accurate decision-making based on incomplete data. Theoretical results and simulations both reveal that non-markovian stochastic processes whose missingness is relatively ignorable with respect to causal estimands can still be optimized using standard Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These results expand the theoretical foundations of safe, data-efficient AI to real-world environments where complete information is unattainable.

Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.

Abstract: We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.

Abstract: Concatenating matrices is a common technique for uncovering shared structures in data through singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximations. The fundamental question arises: How does the singular value spectrum of the concatenated matrix relate to the spectra of its individual components? In the present work, we develop a perturbation technique that extends classical results such as Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices. We setup analytical bounds that quantify stability of singular values under small perturbations in submatrices. The results demonstrate that if submatrices are close in a norm, dominant singular values of the concatenated matrix remain stable enabling controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression. These provide a theoretical basis for improved matrix clustering and compression strategies with applications in the numerical linear algebra, signal processing, and data-driven modeling.

Abstract: The growing context lengths of large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient inference, primarily due to GPU memory and bandwidth constraints. We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.

Abstract: Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment. Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance. Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only 40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in which the agent can leverage both an offline dataset and online interactions to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm and analysis and show that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms with the offline dataset outperforms any pure online or offline algorithm alone and achieves state-of-the-art results under two learning metrics, i.e., sub-optimality gap and online learning regret. Specifically, we show that our algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)$ is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$ are the numbers of offline and online samples, respectively. For regret minimization, we show that it achieves a constant $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up compared to pure online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an interesting separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline dataset for sub-optimality gap minimization and regret minimization. We further validate our theoretical findings in several experiments in special RL models such as linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes (MDPs).

<title>Table Foundation Models: on knowledge pre-training for tabular learning</title>

Abstract: Table foundation models bring high hopes to data science: pre-trained on tabular data to embark knowledge or priors, they should facilitate downstream tasks on tables. One specific challenge is that of data semantics: numerical entries take their meaning from context, e.g., column name. Pre-trained neural networks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently boosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world knowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular foundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring benefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or combined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model that transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the string to capture semantics. Pre-trained on large relational data, TARTE yields representations that facilitate subsequent learning with little additional cost. These representations can be fine-tuned or combined with other learners, giving models that push the state-of-the-art prediction performance and improve the prediction/computation performance trade-off. Specialized to a task or a domain, TARTE gives domain-specific representations that facilitate further learning. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to knowledge pre-training for tabular learning.

<title>Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper architectures. This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation, converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.

Abstract: Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation is critically important for marine research, yet remains challenging due to its substantial thermal inertia and extended time delay. Machine learning (ML)-based models have demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean simulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the slow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural ocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive graph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with ocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework tailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex dynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling relationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S and extreme event simulation. The codes are available at https://github.com/YuanGao-YG/NeuralOM.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on tabular data is the cornerstone of many real-world applications. Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward better prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. The proposed method is evaluated on financial benchmark datasets and compared against established LLMs.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a challenging task for foundation models due to temporal heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and the lack of inherent symbolic structure. In this work, we propose DRAGON (Discrete Representation and Augmented Graph encoding Over de BruijN Graphs), a novel encoder that introduces Multivariate de Bruijn Graphs (MdBGs) to bridge the gap between symbolic representations and neural modeling. DRAGON discretizes continuous input sequences and maps them onto a fixed graph structure, enabling dynamic context recovery via graph-based attention. Integrated as an auxiliary module within a dual-branch architecture, DRAGON augments conventional CNN-based encoders with symbolic, structure-aware representations.

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10\% labeled data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence, and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption (CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic, incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary improvement. Code for this paper can be found at: https://github.com/evanshedges2/orthograd\_improves\_calibration.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast, hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the finegrained semantic modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real world knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e., translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less, position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing datasets, training settings and strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.
  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of 14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of datasets, particularly those with subtle or noisy class distinctions (e.g., ChestMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST). This study represents the first systematic application of quantum-enhanced RWKV in the visual domain, offering insights into the architectural trade-offs and future potential of quantum models for lightweight and efficient vision tasks.

Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small, uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of rollouts used for policy evaluation.

Abstract: Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a promising tool for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization, where the key is to produce diverse, challenging variations of the source domain via costly targeted augmentations that maximize its generalization effect. Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong generalization performance across various single source domain generalization (sDG) benchmarks.

<title>FZOO: Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models towards Adam-Scale Speed</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.09034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks: the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order (ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3, across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed, full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on memory-efficient pre-training.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However, specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/skeletondyh/RADM

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.

Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules, such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.

<title>Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data</title>

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.

Abstract: This work analyzes how the trade-off between the modeling error, the terminal value function error, and the prediction horizon affects the performance of a nominal receding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either one or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.

<title>Bayes correlated equilibria, no-regret dynamics in Bayesian games, and the price of anarchy</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates equilibrium computation and the price of anarchy for Bayesian games, which are the fundamental models of games with incomplete information. In normal-form games with complete information, it is known that efficiently computable no-regret dynamics converge to correlated equilibria, and the price of anarchy for correlated equilibria can be bounded for a broad class of games called smooth games. However, in Bayesian games, as surveyed by Forges (1993), several non-equivalent extensions of correlated equilibria exist, and it remains unclear whether they can be efficiently computed or whether their price of anarchy can be bounded.
  In this paper, we identify a natural extension of correlated equilibria that can be computed efficiently and is guaranteed to have bounds on the price of anarchy in various games. First, we propose a variant of regret called untruthful swap regret. If each player minimizes it in repeated play of Bayesian games, the empirical distribution of these dynamics is guaranteed to converge to communication equilibria, which is one of the extensions of correlated equilibria proposed by Myerson (1982). We present an efficient algorithm for minimizing untruthful swap regret with a sublinear upper bound, which we prove to be tight in terms of the number of types. As a result, by simulating the dynamics with our algorithm, we can approximately compute a communication equilibrium in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend existing lower bounds on the price of anarchy based on the smoothness arguments from Bayes--Nash equilibria to equilibria obtained by the proposed dynamics.

Abstract: Sampling-based path planning algorithms play an important role in autonomous robotics. However, a common problem among the RRT-based algorithms is that the initial path generated is not optimal, and the convergence is too slow for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel image-based learning algorithm using a Convolutional Block Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CBAGAN-RRT) with a combination of spatial and channel attention and a novel loss function to design the heuristics, find a better optimal path, and improve the convergence of the algorithm, both concerning time and speed. The probability distribution of the paths generated from our GAN model is used to guide the sampling process for the RRT algorithm. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using both the image quality generation metrics, like IOU Score, Dice Score, FID score, and path planning metrics like time cost and the number of nodes. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of various components in our network architecture. The advantage of our approach is that we can avoid the complicated preprocessing in the state space, our model can be generalized to complex environments like those containing turns and narrow passages without loss of accuracy, and our model can be easily integrated with other sampling-based path planning algorithms.

Abstract: The current trend of scaling language models involves increasing both parameter count and training dataset size. Extrapolating this trend suggests that training dataset size may soon be limited by the amount of text data available on the internet. Motivated by this limit, we investigate scaling language models in data-constrained regimes. Specifically, we run a large set of experiments varying the extent of data repetition and compute budget, ranging up to 900 billion training tokens and 9 billion parameter models. We find that with constrained data for a fixed compute budget, training with up to 4 epochs of repeated data yields negligible changes to loss compared to having unique data. However, with more repetition, the value of adding compute eventually decays to zero. We propose and empirically validate a scaling law for compute optimality that accounts for the decreasing value of repeated tokens and excess parameters. Finally, we experiment with approaches mitigating data scarcity, including augmenting the training dataset with code data or removing commonly used filters. Models and datasets from our 400 training runs are freely available at https://github.com/huggingface/datablations.

Abstract: Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) and Coordinate (COO) are popular compression formats for sparse matrices. However, both CSC and COO are general purpose and cannot take advantage of any of the properties of the data other than sparsity, such as data redundancy. Highly redundant sparse data is common in many machine learning applications, such as genomics, and is often too large for in-core computation using conventional sparse storage formats. In this paper, we present two extensions to CSC: (1) Value-Compressed Sparse Column (VCSC) and (2) Index- and Value-Compressed Sparse Column (IVCSC). VCSC takes advantage of high redundancy within a column to further compress data up to 3-fold over COO and 2.25-fold over CSC, without significant negative impact to performance characteristics. IVCSC extends VCSC by compressing index arrays through delta encoding and byte-packing, achieving a 10-fold decrease in memory usage over COO and 7.5-fold decrease over CSC. Our benchmarks on simulated and real data show that VCSC and IVCSC can be read in compressed form with little added computational cost. These two novel compression formats offer a broadly useful solution to encoding and reading redundant sparse data.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), providing more realistic neuronal dynamics, have been shown to achieve performance comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in several machine learning tasks. Information is processed as spikes within SNNs in an event-based mechanism that significantly reduces energy consumption. However, training SNNs is challenging due to the non-differentiable nature of the spiking mechanism. Traditional approaches, such as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), have shown effectiveness but come with additional computational and memory costs and are biologically implausible. In contrast, recent works propose alternative learning methods with varying degrees of locality, demonstrating success in classification tasks. In this work, we show that these methods share similarities during the training process, while they present a trade-off between biological plausibility and performance. Further, given the implicitly recurrent nature of SNNs, this research investigates the influence of the addition of explicit recurrence to SNNs. We experimentally prove that the addition of explicit recurrent weights enhances the robustness of SNNs. We also investigate the performance of local learning methods under gradient and non-gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability across a wide range of downstream vision tasks, showcasing exceptional performance. However, as these models scale to billions or even trillions of parameters, conventional full fine-tuning has become increasingly impractical due to its high computational and storage demands. To address these challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning while making minimal adjustments to the model parameters. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in the visual PEFT field, systematically reviewing current methodologies and categorizing them into four primary categories: addition-based, partial-based, unified-based, and multi-task tuning. In addition, this paper offers an in-depth analysis of widely used visual datasets and real-world applications where PEFT methods have been successfully applied. Furthermore, this paper introduces the V-PEFT Bench, a unified benchmark designed to standardize the evaluation of PEFT methods across a diverse set of vision tasks, ensuring consistency and fairness in comparison. Finally, the paper outlines potential directions for future research to propel advances in the PEFT field.

Abstract: The development of AI-assisted chemical synthesis tools requires comprehensive datasets covering diverse reaction types, yet current high-throughput experimental (HTE) approaches are expensive and limited in scope. Chemical literature represents a vast, underexplored data source containing thousands of reactions published annually. However, extracting reaction information from literature faces significant challenges including varied writing styles, complex coreference relationships, and multimodal information presentation. This paper proposes ChemMiner, a novel end-to-end framework leveraging multiple agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to extract high-fidelity chemical data from literature. ChemMiner incorporates three specialized agents: a text analysis agent for coreference mapping, a multimodal agent for non-textual information extraction, and a synthesis analysis agent for data generation. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive benchmark with expert-annotated chemical literature to evaluate both extraction efficiency and precision. Experimental results demonstrate reaction identification rates comparable to human chemists while significantly reducing processing time, with high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Our open-sourced benchmark facilitates future research in chemical literature data mining.

Abstract: Deep clustering, which learns representation and semantic clustering without labels information, poses a great challenge for deep learning-based approaches. Despite significant progress in recent years, most existing methods focus on uniformly distributed datasets, significantly limiting the practical applicability of their methods. In this paper, we propose a more practical problem setting named deep imbalanced clustering, where the underlying classes exhibit an imbalance distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel optimal transport-based pseudo-label learning framework. Our framework formulates pseudo-label generation as a Semantic-regularized Progressive Partial Optimal Transport (SP$^2$OT) problem, which progressively transports each sample to imbalanced clusters under prior and semantic relation constraints, thus generating high-quality and imbalance-aware pseudo-labels. To solve the SP$^2$OT problem, we propose a projected mirror descent algorithm, which alternates between: (1) computing the gradient of the SP$^2$OT objective, and (2) performing gradient descent with projection via an entropy-regularized progressive partial optimal transport formulation. Furthermore, we formulate the second step as an unbalanced optimal transport problem with augmented constraints and develop an efficient solution based on fast matrix scaling algorithms. Experiments on various datasets, including a human-curated long-tailed CIFAR100, challenging ImageNet-R, and large-scale subsets of fine-grained iNaturalist2018 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA.

Abstract: Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.

Abstract: From benign overfitting in overparameterized models to rich power-law scalings in performance, simple ridge regression displays surprising behaviors sometimes thought to be limited to deep neural networks. This balance of phenomenological richness with analytical tractability makes ridge regression the model system of choice in high-dimensional machine learning. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective on recent results on ridge regression using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. We highlight the fact that statistical fluctuations in empirical covariance matrices can be absorbed into a renormalization of the ridge parameter. This `deterministic equivalence' allows us to obtain analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors in a few lines of algebra by leveraging the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. From these precise asymptotics, we can easily identify sources of power-law scaling in model performance. In all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. This allows us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful support tools across various natural language tasks and a range of application domains. Recent studies focus on exploring their capabilities for data annotation. This paper provides a comparative overview of twelve studies investigating the potential of LLMs in labelling data. While the models demonstrate promising cost and time-saving benefits, there exist considerable limitations, such as representativeness, bias, sensitivity to prompt variations and English language preference. Leveraging insights from these studies, our empirical analysis further examines the alignment between human and GPT-generated opinion distributions across four subjective datasets. In contrast to the studies examining representation, our methodology directly obtains the opinion distribution from GPT. Our analysis thereby supports the minority of studies that are considering diverse perspectives when evaluating data annotation tasks and highlights the need for further research in this direction.

Abstract: Motivated by the concept of satisficing in decision-making, we consider the problem of satisficing regret minimization in bandit optimization. In this setting, the learner aims at selecting satisficing arms (arms with mean reward exceeding a certain threshold value) as frequently as possible. The performance is measured by satisficing regret, which is the cumulative deficit of the chosen arm's mean reward compared to the threshold. We propose SELECT, a general algorithmic template for Satisficing REgret Minimization via SampLing and LowEr Confidence bound Testing, that attains constant expected satisficing regret for a wide variety of bandit optimization problems in the realizable case (i.e., a satisficing arm exists). As a complement, SELECT also enjoys the same (standard) regret guarantee as the oracle in the non-realizable case. To further ensure stability of the algorithm, we introduce SELECT-LITE that achieves a light-tailed satisficing regret distribution plus a constant expected satisficing regret in the realizable case and a sub-linear expected (standard) regret in the non-realizable case. Notably, SELECT-LITE can operate on learning oracles with heavy-tailed (standard) regret distribution. More importantly, our results reveal the surprising compatibility between constant expected satisficing regret and light-tailed satisficing regret distribution, which is in sharp contrast to the case of (standard) regret. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the performance of SELECT and SELECT-LITE on both synthetic datasets and a real-world dynamic pricing case study.

Abstract: Image composition and generation are processes where the artists need control over various parts of the generated images. However, the current state-of-the-art generation models, like Stable Diffusion, cannot handle fine-grained part-level attributes in the text prompts. Specifically, when additional attribute details are added to the base text prompt, these text-to-image models either generate an image vastly different from the image generated from the base prompt or ignore the attribute details. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartComposer, a training-free method that enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level attributes specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image. All stages of PartComposer are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartComposer through qualitative visual examples and quantitative comparisons with contemporary baselines.

Abstract: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes pre-trained language models to perform indexing and document retrieval via end-to-end learning without relying on external indexes. However, DSI requires full re-training to index new documents, causing significant computational inefficiencies. Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has stimulated researchers to seek effective and efficient approaches to deal with LLM hallucinations and low-quality outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a key element of machine learning applications in dealing with such challenges. However, research to date on UQ for LLMs has been fragmented in terms of techniques and evaluation methodologies. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a novel benchmark that implements a collection of state-of-the-art UQ baselines and offers an environment for controllable and consistent evaluation of novel UQ techniques over various text generation tasks. Our benchmark also supports the assessment of confidence normalization methods in terms of their ability to provide interpretable scores. Using our benchmark, we conduct a large-scale empirical investigation of UQ and normalization techniques across eleven tasks, identifying the most effective approaches.

<title>Efficient Shallow Ritz Method For 1D Diffusion-Reaction Problems</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the shallow Ritz method for solving one-dimensional diffusion-reaction problems. The method is capable of improving the order of approximation for non-smooth problems. By following a similar approach to the one presented in [9], we present a damped block Newton (dBN) method to achieve nearly optimal order of approximation. The dBN method optimizes the Ritz functional by alternating between the linear and non-linear parameters of the shallow ReLU neural network (NN). For diffusion-reaction problems, new difficulties arise: (1) for the linear parameters, the mass matrix is dense and even more ill-conditioned than the stiffness matrix, and (2) for the non-linear parameters, the Hessian matrix is dense and may be singular. This paper addresses these challenges, resulting in a dBN method with computational cost of ${\cal O}(n)$.
  The ideas presented for diffusion-reaction problems can also be applied to least-squares approximation problems. For both applications, starting with the non-linear parameters as a uniform partition, numerical experiments show that the dBN method moves the mesh points to nearly optimal locations.

<title>Understanding and Reducing the Class-Dependent Effects of Data Augmentation with A Two-Player Game Approach</title>

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed, it may have an unfair effect in multi-class classification. While data augmentation generally improves the overall performance (and therefore is beneficial for many classes), it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose CLAM, a CLAss-dependent Multiplicative-weights method. To derive it, we first formulate the training of a classifier as a non-linear optimization problem that aims at simultaneously maximizing the individual class performances and balancing them. By rewriting this optimization problem as an adversarial two-player game, we propose a novel multiplicative weight algorithm, for which we prove the convergence. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that the class-dependent effects of data augmentation is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical results over six datasets demonstrate that the performance of learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.

Abstract: Queries to large language models (LLMs) can be divided into two parts: the instruction/question and the accompanying context. The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia-like texts written in a neutral and factual tone. However, real-world RAG applications often retrieve internet-based text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, posing challenges for downstream tasks. This paper introduces (a) a dataset that transforms RAG-retrieved passages into emotionally inflected and sarcastic text, (b) an emotion translation model for adapting text to different tones, and (c) a prompt-based method to improve LLMs' pragmatic interpretation of retrieved text.

Abstract: Here we show that a general-purpose large language model (LLM) chatbot, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can be transformed via supervised fine-tuning of engineered prompts into a chemical language model (CLM), SmileyLlama, for molecule generation. We benchmark SmileyLlama by comparing it to CLMs trained from scratch on large amounts of ChEMBL data for their ability to generate valid and novel drug-like molecules. We also use direct preference optimization to both improve SmileyLlama's adherence to a prompt and to generate molecules within the iMiner reinforcement learning framework to predict new drug molecules with optimized 3D conformations and high binding affinity to drug targets, illustrated with the SARS-Cov-2 Main Protease. This overall framework allows a LLM to speak directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties, rather than acting only as a chatbot with knowledge of chemistry or as a helpful virtual assistant. While our dataset and analyses are geared toward drug discovery, this general procedure can be extended to other chemical applications such as chemical synthesis.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that optimizability of any function F using Gradient Flow from all initializations implies a Poincar\'e Inequality for Gibbs measures mu_{beta} = e^{-beta F}/Z at low temperature. In particular, under mild regularity assumptions on the convergence rate of Gradient Flow, we establish that mu_{beta} satisfies a Poincar\'e Inequality with constant O(C'+1/beta) for beta >= Omega(d), where C' is the Poincar\'e constant of mu_{beta} restricted to a neighborhood of the global minimizers of F. Under an additional mild condition on F, we show that mu_{beta} satisfies a Log-Sobolev Inequality with constant O(beta max(S, 1) max(C', 1)) where S denotes the second moment of mu_{beta}. Here asymptotic notation hides F-dependent parameters. At a high level, this establishes that optimizability via Gradient Flow from every initialization implies a Poincar\'e and Log-Sobolev Inequality for the low-temperature Gibbs measure, which in turn imply sampling from all initializations.
  Analogously, we establish that under the same assumptions, if F can be initialized from everywhere except some set S, then mu_{beta} satisfies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality with parameters (O(C'+1/beta), O(mu_{beta}(S))) for \beta = Omega(d). At a high level, this shows while optimizability from 'most' initializations implies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality, which in turn implies sampling from suitable warm starts. Our regularity assumptions are mild and as a consequence, we show we can efficiently sample from several new natural and interesting classes of non-log-concave densities, an important setting with relatively few examples. As another corollary, we obtain efficient discrete-time sampling results for log-concave measures satisfying milder regularity conditions than smoothness, similar to Lehec (2023).

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.

<title>Beware of Calibration Data for Pruning Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across various fields, model compression has become increasingly crucial for reducing costs and improving inference efficiency. Post-training pruning is a promising method that does not require resource-intensive iterative training and only needs a small amount of calibration data to assess the importance of parameters. Recent research has enhanced post-training pruning from different aspects but few of them systematically explore the effects of calibration data, and it is unclear if there exist better calibration data construction strategies. We fill this blank and surprisingly observe that calibration data is also crucial to post-training pruning, especially for high sparsity. Through controlled experiments on important influence factors of calibration data, including the pruning settings, the amount of data, and its similarity with pre-training data, we observe that a small size of data is adequate, and more similar data to its pre-training stage can yield better performance. As pre-training data is usually inaccessible for advanced LLMs, we further provide a self-generating calibration data synthesis strategy to construct feasible calibration data. Experimental results on recent strong open-source LLMs (e.g., DCLM, and LLaMA-3) show that the proposed strategy can enhance the performance of strong pruning methods (e.g., Wanda, DSnoT, OWL) by a large margin (up to $2.68\%$).

Abstract: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.

Abstract: We derive a fundamental trade-off between standard and adversarial risk in a rather general situation that formalizes the following simple intuition: "If no (nearly) optimal predictor is smooth, adversarial robustness comes at the cost of accuracy." As a concrete example, we evaluate the derived trade-off in regression with polynomial ridge functions under mild regularity conditions. Generalizing our analysis of this example, we formulate a necessary condition under which adversarial robustness can be achieved without significant degradation of the accuracy. This necessary condition is expressed in terms of a quantity that resembles the Poincar\'{e} constant of the data distribution.

<title>Bridge: A Unified Framework to Knowledge Graph Completion via Language Models and Knowledge Representation</title>

arXiv:2411.06660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is a task of inferring missing triples based on existing Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Both structural and semantic information are vital for successful KGC. However, existing methods only use either the structural knowledge from the KG embeddings or the semantic information from pre-trained language models (PLMs), leading to suboptimal model performance. Moreover, since PLMs are not trained on KGs, directly using PLMs to encode triples may be inappropriate. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Bridge, which jointly encodes structural and semantic information of KGs. Specifically, we strategically encode entities and relations separately by PLMs to better utilize the semantic knowledge of PLMs and enable structured representation learning via a structural learning principle. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between KGs and PLMs, we employ a self-supervised representation learning method called BYOL to fine-tune PLMs with two different views of a triple. Unlike BYOL, which uses augmentation methods to create two semantically similar views of the same image, potentially altering the semantic information. We strategically separate the triple into two parts to create different views, thus avoiding semantic alteration. Experiments demonstrate that Bridge outperforms the SOTA models on three benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) prompted with text and audio have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various auditory tasks, including speech, music, and general audio, showing emergent abilities on unseen tasks. However, their potential has yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior -- tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and animal behavior studies. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our training dataset consists of carefully curated text-audio pairs spanning bioacoustics, speech, and music, designed to address the field's limited availability of annotated data. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. We evaluate NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets a new state of the art on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we release our model weights, benchmark data, and open-source the code for training and benchmark data generation and model training.

Abstract: In automated driving, object detection is crucial for perceiving the environment. Although deep learning-based detectors offer high performance, their black-box nature complicates safety assurance. We propose a novel methodology to analyze how object- and environment-related factors affect LiDAR- and camera-based 3D object detectors. A statistical univariate analysis relates each factor to pedestrian detection errors. Additionally, a Random Forest (RF) model predicts errors from meta-information, with Shapley Values interpreting feature importance. By capturing feature dependencies, the RF enables a nuanced analysis of detection errors. Understanding these factors reveals detector performance gaps and supports safer object detection system development.

<title>The Limited Impact of Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2411.08870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.

<title>Enhancing Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems by Integrating Crafted Measurements</title>

arXiv:2411.09850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generations. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior for solving general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling-based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during restoration sampling. To address this observation, we first reveal that forming the log-posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., noisy measurement from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the early posterior sampling. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., noisy measurement crafted by a reverse denoising process, rather than constructed from the diffusion forward process) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches. Code is available at: https://github.com/sjz5202/DPS-CM.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.

Abstract: In the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of research efforts is spent on developing increasingly sophisticated recommendation models, also using increasingly more computational resources. Unfortunately, most of these research efforts target a very small set of application domains, mostly e-commerce and media recommendation. Furthermore, many of these models are never evaluated with users, let alone put into practice. The scientific, economic and societal value of much of these efforts by scholars therefore remains largely unclear. To achieve a stronger positive impact resulting from these efforts, we posit that we as a research community should more often address use cases where recommender systems contribute to societal good (RS4Good). In this opinion piece, we first discuss a number of examples where the use of recommender systems for problems of societal concern has been successfully explored in the literature. We then proceed by outlining a paradigmatic shift that is needed to conduct successful RS4Good research, where the key ingredients are interdisciplinary collaborations and longitudinal evaluation approaches with humans in the loop.

<title>PriorDiffusion: Leverage Language Prior in Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>

arXiv:2411.16750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisance. We argue that language prior can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the inductive bias learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. The ability of these models to generate images that align with text indicates that they have learned the spatial relationships, size, and shape of specified objects, which can be applied to improve depth estimation. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both images and corresponding text descriptions to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language prior enhances the model's perception of specific regions of images that users care about and describe. Simultaneously, language prior acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve faster training convergence, fewer inference diffusion steps, and state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Abstract: We study the problem of solving matrix games of the form $\max_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{W}}\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\Delta}\mathbf{p}^{\top}A\mathbf{w}$, where $A$ is some matrix and $\Delta$ is the probability simplex. This problem encapsulates canonical tasks such as finding a linear separator and computing Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. However, perhaps surprisingly, its inherent complexity (as formalized in the standard framework of oracle complexity [Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983]) is not well-understood. In this work, we first identify different oracle models which are implicitly used by prior algorithms, amounting to multiplying the matrix $A$ by a vector from either one or both sides. We then prove complexity lower bounds for algorithms under both access models, which in particular imply a separation between them. Specifically, we start by showing that algorithms for linear separability based on one-sided multiplications must require $\Omega(\gamma_A^{-2})$ iterations, where $\gamma_A$ is the margin, as matched by the Perceptron algorithm. We then prove that accelerated algorithms for this task, which utilize multiplications from both sides, must require $\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{A}^{-2/3})$ iterations, establishing the first oracle complexity barrier for such algorithms. Finally, by adapting our lower bound to $\ell_1$ geometry, we prove that computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2/5})$ iterations, which is an exponential improvement over the previously best-known lower bound due to Hadiji et al. [2024].

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are widespread, but their limited safety guardrails expose end users to harmful content and potentially allow for model misuse. Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce AlignGuard, a method for safety alignment of T2I models. We enable the application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7x more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. AlignGuard consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks. Code and data will be shared at https://safetydpo.github.io/.

Abstract: Interpretability in Table Question Answering (Table QA) is critical, especially in high-stakes domains like finance and healthcare. While recent Table QA approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high accuracy, they often produce ambiguous explanations of how answers are derived.
  We propose Plan-of-SQLs (POS), a new Table QA method that makes the model's decision-making process interpretable. POS decomposes a question into a sequence of atomic steps, each directly translated into an executable SQL command on the table, thereby ensuring that every intermediate result is transparent. Through extensive experiments, we show that: First, POS generates the highest-quality explanations among compared methods, which markedly improves the users' ability to simulate and verify the model's decisions. Second, when evaluated on standard Table QA benchmarks (TabFact, WikiTQ, and FeTaQA), POS achieves QA accuracy that is competitive to existing methods, while also offering greater efficiency-requiring significantly fewer LLM calls and table database queries (up to 25x fewer)-and more robust performance on large-sized tables. Finally, we observe high agreement (up to 90.59% in forward simulation) between LLMs and human users when making decisions based on the same explanations, suggesting that LLMs could serve as an effective proxy for humans in evaluating Table QA explanations.

Abstract: We study zero-sum games in the space of probability distributions over the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with entropy regularization, in the setting when the interaction function between the players is smooth and strongly convex-strongly concave. We prove an exponential convergence guarantee for the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics to compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game. We also study the finite-particle approximation of the mean-field min-max Langevin dynamics, both in continuous and discrete times. We prove biased convergence guarantees for the continuous-time finite-particle min-max Langevin dynamics to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an explicit bias term which does not scale with the number of particles. We also prove biased convergence guarantees for the discrete-time finite-particle min-max Langevin algorithm to the stationary mean-field equilibrium distribution with an additional bias term which scales with the step size and the number of particles. This provides an explicit iteration complexity for the average particle along the finite-particle algorithm to approximately compute the equilibrium distribution of the zero-sum game.

Abstract: Biomedical Knowledge Graphs (BKGs) integrate diverse datasets to elucidate complex relationships within the biomedical field. Effective link prediction on these graphs can uncover valuable connections, such as potential novel drug-disease relations. We introduce a novel multimodal approach that unifies embeddings from specialized Language Models (LMs) with Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) to enhance intra-entity relationships while employing a Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model to capture inter-entity relationships for effective link prediction. To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present PrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including biological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By combining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our approach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link predictions even for unseen nodes. Experimental results on PrimeKG++ and the DrugBank drug-target interaction dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse biomedical datasets. Our source code, pre-trained models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/BioMedKG

Abstract: The remarkable performance of the o1 model in complex reasoning demonstrates that test-time compute scaling can further unlock the model's potential, enabling powerful System-2 thinking. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive surveys for test-time compute scaling. We trace the concept of test-time compute back to System-1 models. In System-1 models, test-time compute addresses distribution shifts and improves robustness and generalization through parameter updating, input modification, representation editing, and output calibration. In System-2 models, it enhances the model's reasoning ability to solve complex problems through repeated sampling, self-correction, and tree search. We organize this survey according to the trend of System-1 to System-2 thinking, highlighting the key role of test-time compute in the transition from System-1 models to weak System-2 models, and then to strong System-2 models. We also point out advanced topics and future directions.

<title>PRMBench: A Fine-grained and Challenging Benchmark for Process-Level Reward Models</title>

Abstract: Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.

Abstract: Pressing is a fundamental defensive strategy in football, characterized by applying pressure on the ball owning team to regain possession. Despite its significance, existing metrics for measuring pressing often lack precision or comprehensive consideration of positional data, player movement and speed. This research introduces an innovative framework for quantifying pressing intensity, leveraging advancements in positional tracking data and components from Spearman's Pitch Control model. Our method integrates player velocities, movement directions, and reaction times to compute the time required for a defender to intercept an attacker or the ball. This time-to-intercept measure is then transformed into probabilistic values using a logistic function, enabling dynamic and intuitive analysis of pressing situations at the individual frame level. the model captures how every player's movement influences pressure on the field, offering actionable insights for coaches, analysts, and decision-makers. By providing a robust and intepretable metric, our approach facilitates the identification of pressing strategies, advanced situational analyses, and the derivation of metrics, advancing the analytical capabilities for modern football.

<title>Efficiently Serving Large Multimodal Models Using EPD Disaggregation</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more images per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to significant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT (up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

<title>Semiparametric Double Reinforcement Learning with Applications to Long-Term Causal Inference</title>

Abstract: Long-term causal effects often must be estimated from short-term data due to limited follow-up in healthcare, economics, and online platforms. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a natural framework for capturing such long-term dynamics through sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Double Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables efficient inference on policy values in MDPs, but nonparametric implementations require strong intertemporal overlap assumptions and often exhibit high variance and instability. We propose a semiparametric extension of DRL for efficient inference on linear functionals of the Q-function--such as policy values--in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing structural restrictions on the Q-function, our approach relaxes the strong overlap conditions required by nonparametric methods and improves statistical efficiency. Under model misspecification, our estimators target the functional of the best-approximating Q-function, with only second-order bias. We provide conditions for valid inference using sieve methods and data-driven model selection. A central challenge in DRL is the estimation of nuisance functions, such as density ratios, which often involve difficult minimax optimization. To address this, we introduce a novel plug-in estimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which combines fitted Q-iteration with an isotonic regression adjustment. The estimator is debiased without requiring estimation of additional nuisance functions and reduces high-dimensional overlap assumptions to a one-dimensional condition. Bellman calibration extends isotonic calibration--widely used in prediction and classification--to the MDP setting and may be of independent interest.

<title>Adaptive Rank Allocation for Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and versatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting to various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices exacerbates performance degradation of low-rank adaptation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel Adaptive Rank Allocation framework for federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance similar feature representation across clients, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to automatically remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational cost and memory usage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to 8.49% across various datasets and models under heterogeneous data while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40$ \times$. Moreover, experiments on various edge devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90% and 46.95%, respectively.

Abstract: High Mountain Asia (HMA) holds the highest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for future hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from 13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over HMA via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The MoE is trained and validated against gridded historical precipitation data, yielding 32% improvement over an equally-weighted average and 254% improvement over choosing any single ensemble member. This approach is then used to generate precipitation projections for the near future (2036-2065) and far future (2066-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared to previous estimates, the MoE projects wetter summers but drier winters over the western Himalayas and Karakoram and wetter winters over the Tibetan Plateau, Hengduan Shan, and South East Tibet.

Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies by enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, accurate forecasting remains challenging due to complex nonlinear dependencies, high-dimensional feature spaces, and limited sample sizes-conditions under which classical machine learning models are prone to overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model with Amplitude Encoding, leveraging the unitarity constraint of Parametrized Quantum Circuits (PQC) and the exponential data compression capability of qubits. We evaluate the model on a global recovery rate dataset comprising 1,725 observations and 256 features from 1996 to 2023. Our hybrid method significantly outperforms both classical neural networks and QML models using Angle Encoding, achieving a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.228, compared to 0.246 and 0.242, respectively. It also performs competitively with ensemble tree methods such as XGBoost. While practical implementation challenges remain for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, our quantum simulation and preliminary results on noisy simulators demonstrate the promise of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of recovery rate forecasting. These findings illustrate the potential of quantum machine learning in shaping the future of credit risk prediction.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grounded responses by leveraging external knowledge databases without altering model parameters. Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address these challenges, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and other learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.32% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models.

Abstract: We study the mixing time guarantee for sampling in relative Fisher information via the Proximal Sampler algorithm, which is an approximate proximal discretization of the Langevin dynamics. We show that when the target probability distribution is strongly log-concave, the relative Fisher information converges exponentially fast along the Proximal Sampler; this matches the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the continuous-time Langevin dynamics for strongly log-concave target. When combined with a standard implementation of the Proximal Sampler via rejection sampling, this exponential convergence rate provides a high-accuracy iteration complexity guarantee for the Proximal Sampler in relative Fisher information when the target distribution is strongly log-concave and log-smooth. Our proof proceeds by establishing a strong data processing inequality for relative Fisher information along the Gaussian channel under strong log-concavity, and a data processing inequality along the reverse Gaussian channel for a special distribution. The forward and reverse Gaussian channels compose to form the Proximal Sampler, and these data processing inequalities imply the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the Proximal Sampler.

Abstract: Ensuring model calibration is critical for reliable prediction, yet popular distribution-free methods such as histogram binning and isotonic regression offer only asymptotic guarantees. We introduce a unified framework for Venn and Venn-Abers calibration that extends Vovk's approach beyond binary classification to a broad class of prediction problems defined by generic loss functions. Our method transforms any perfectly in-sample calibrated predictor into a set-valued predictor that, in finite samples, outputs at least one marginally calibrated point prediction. These set predictions shrink asymptotically and converge to a conditionally calibrated prediction, capturing epistemic uncertainty. We further propose Venn multicalibration, a new approach for achieving finite-sample calibration across subpopulations. For quantile loss, our framework recovers group-conditional and multicalibrated conformal prediction as special cases and yields novel prediction intervals with quantile-conditional coverage.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Abstract: Language models usually use left-to-right (L2R) autoregressive factorization. However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability, and directional conditional entropy. We analyze the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous. Our code and checkpoints are released at https://github.com/apple/ml-reversal-blessing.

Abstract: Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Anthropic allow customers to fine-tune frontier LMs for specific use cases. To prevent abuse, these providers apply filters to block fine-tuning on overtly harmful data. In this setting, we make three contributions: First, while past work has shown that safety alignment is "shallow", we correspondingly demonstrate that existing fine-tuning attacks are shallow -- attacks target only the first several tokens of the model response, and consequently can be blocked by generating the first several response tokens with an aligned model. Second, we conceptually illustrate how to make attacks deeper by introducing a new fine-tuning attack that trains models to first refuse harmful requests before answering them; this "refuse-then-comply" strategy bypasses shallow defenses and produces harmful responses that evade output filters. Third, we demonstrate the potency of our new fine-tuning attack by jailbreaking both open-source models equipped with defenses and production models, achieving attack success rates of 57% and 72% against GPT-4o and Claude Haiku, respectively. Our attack received a $2000 bug bounty from OpenAI and was acknowledged as a vulnerability by Anthropic. Our work undermines the notion that models are safe because they initially refuse harmful requests and broadens awareness of the scope of attacks that face production fine-tuning APIs.

Abstract: Existing contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms fail to effectively capture both long-term trends and local patterns across all arms, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with rapidly changing reward structures. They also rely on static exploration rates, which do not dynamically adjust to changing conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LNUCB-TA, a hybrid bandit model integrating a novel nonlinear component (adaptive k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) for reducing time complexity, alongside a global-and-local attention-based exploration mechanism. Our approach uniquely combines linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, with the nonlinear module dynamically adjusting k based on reward variance to enhance spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This reduces the likelihood of selecting suboptimal arms while improving reward estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. The attention-based mechanism ranks arms by past performance and selection frequency, dynamically adjusting exploration and exploitation in real time without requiring manual tuning of exploration rates. By integrating global attention (assessing all arms collectively) and local attention (focusing on individual arms), LNUCB-TA efficiently adapts to temporal and spatial complexities. Empirical results show LNUCB-TA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art linear, nonlinear, and hybrid bandits in cumulative and mean reward, convergence, and robustness across different exploration rates. Theoretical analysis further confirms its reliability with a sub-linear regret bound.

Abstract: Time series data are foundational in finance, healthcare, and energy domains. However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data. The complete TSQA dataset, models, user study questionnaires for evaluation, and other related materials have been open-sourced.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit the ability to generalize given few-shot examples in their input prompt, an emergent capability known as in-context learning (ICL). We investigate whether LLMs use ICL to perform structured reasoning in ways that are consistent with a Bayesian framework or rely on pattern matching. Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference. With sufficient demonstrations of biased coin flips via ICL, LLMs update their priors in a Bayesian manner.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, fully validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we study when we might expect the optimization curve induced by gradient descent to be \emph{convex} -- precluding, for example, an initial plateau followed by a sharp decrease, making it difficult to decide when optimization should stop. Although such undesirable behavior can certainly occur when optimizing general functions, might it also occur in the benign and well-studied case of smooth convex functions? As far as we know, this question has not been tackled in previous work. We show, perhaps surprisingly, that the answer crucially depends on the choice of the step size. In particular, for the range of step sizes which are known to result in monotonic convergence to an optimal value, we characterize a regime where the optimization curve will be provably convex, and a regime where the curve can be non-convex. We also extend our results to gradient flow, and to the closely-related but different question of whether the gradient norm decreases monotonically.

Our generalized methods are both more computationally efficient and performant on most of the benchmarks we test against.

Abstract: In this paper, we design a novel distributed learning algorithm using stochastic compressed communications. In detail, we pursue a modular approach, merging ADMM and a gradient-based approach, benefiting from the robustness of the former and the computational efficiency of the latter. Additionally, we integrate a stochastic integral action (error feedback) enabling almost sure rejection of the compression error. We analyze the resulting method in nonconvex scenarios and guarantee almost sure asymptotic convergence to the set of stationary points of the problem. This result is obtained using system-theoretic tools based on stochastic timescale separation. We corroborate our findings with numerical simulations in nonconvex classification.

Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based data filtering as an alternative. Unlike active learning, data filtering selects the gene perturbations before training, meaning it is free of bias due to random initialization and initial random selection. Moreover, reducing the iterations between the wet lab and the model provides several operational advantages resulting in significant acceleration. The proposed methods are motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art. The results demonstrate that graph-based data filtering achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.

Abstract: Transparency and interpretability are crucial for enhancing customer confidence and user engagement, especially when dealing with black-box Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendation systems. Modern recommendation systems leverage Graph Neural Network (GNN) due to their ability to produce high-quality recommendations in terms of both relevance and diversity. Therefore, the explainability of GNN is especially important for Link Prediction (LP) tasks since recommending relevant items can be viewed as predicting links between users and items. GNN explainability has been a well-studied field, but existing methods primarily focus on node or graph-level tasks, leaving a gap in LP explanation techniques. This work introduces Z-REx, a GNN explanation framework designed explicitly for heterogeneous link prediction tasks. Z-REx utilizes structural and attribute perturbation to identify critical substructures and important features while reducing the search space by leveraging domain-specific knowledge. In our experimentation, we show the efficacy of Z-REx in generating contextually relevant and human-interpretable explanations for ZiGNN, a GNN-based recommendation engine, using a real-world real-estate dataset from Zillow Group, Inc. We compare against State-of-The-Art (SOTA) GNN explainers to show Z-REx outperforms them by 61% in the Fidelity metric by producing superior human-interpretable explanations.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn models that perform well on unseen target domains by training on multiple source domains. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), known for finding flat minima that improve generalization, has therefore been widely adopted in DG. However, our analysis reveals that SAM in DG may converge to \textit{fake flat minima}, where the total loss surface appears flat in terms of global sharpness but remains sharp with respect to individual source domains. To understand this phenomenon more precisely, we formalize the average worst-case domain risk as the maximum loss under domain distribution shifts within a bounded divergence, and derive a generalization bound that reveals the limitations of global sharpness-aware minimization. In contrast, we show that individual sharpness provides a valid upper bound on this risk, making it a more suitable proxy for robust domain generalization. Motivated by these insights, we shift the DG paradigm toward minimizing individual sharpness across source domains. We propose \textit{Decreased-overhead Gradual SAM (DGSAM)}, which applies gradual domain-wise perturbations in a computationally efficient manner to consistently reduce individual sharpness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGSAM not only improves average accuracy but also reduces performance variance across domains, while incurring less computational overhead than SAM.

Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs), including multi-modal and generative models, promise to unlock new capabilities for next-generation Edge AI applications. However, performing inference with LFMs in resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge environments, such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), presents significant challenges for workload orchestration due to time-varying network, compute, and storage conditions. In particular, current split inference strategies, which partition LFM layers across nodes, are not designed to adapt to fluctuating workloads, dynamic bandwidth conditions, or evolving privacy constraints in high-utilization MEC environments. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive split inference orchestration framework that elevates both the placement and partitioning of LFM layers to runtime-tunable variables. Specifically, our framework enables real-time, quality-of-service (QoS)-aware management of inference workloads by extending conventional orchestrators with three key services: (1) Capacity-aware workload distribution, which continuously profiles node resources and selects an optimal subset of MEC nodes; (2) Dynamic partition migration, which transparently relocates pre-cut LFM segments in response to changes in utilization or network conditions; (3) Real-time reconfiguration, which dynamically re-splits LFM layers to balance latency, throughput, and privacy. We formalize the joint placement-partitioning problem, outline a reference architecture and algorithmic workflow, and discuss applicability in representative smart city, V2X, and industrial edge scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly utilized in real-world applications, guarantees of task-specific metrics are essential for their reliable deployment. Previous studies have introduced various criteria of conformal uncertainty grounded in split conformal prediction, which offer user-specified correctness coverage. However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level. Our approach not only facilitates rigorous management of miscoverage rates across both single-domain and interdisciplinary contexts, but also enhances the efficiency of predictions. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the components of the conformal procedures, aiming to approximate conditional coverage, particularly in high-stakes question-answering tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the maj@n metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model maj@n, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models represent a significant advance in generative modeling, demonstrating remarkable success in synthesizing complex, high-quality discrete data. However, to avoid exponential computational costs, they typically rely on calculating per-dimension transition probabilities when learning high-dimensional distributions. In this study, we rigorously prove that this approach leads to a worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces, offering a theoretical pathway to faithfully capture the true joint distribution. By deriving posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit that utilizes temporal information for parameter sharing and incorporates learnable classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise, eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage in joint distribution learning.

Abstract: LLMs often need effective configurations, like temperature and reasoning steps, to handle tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving, ranging from joke generation to mathematical reasoning. Existing prompting approaches usually adopt general-purpose, fixed configurations that work 'well enough' across tasks but seldom achieve task-specific optimality. To address this gap, we introduce AdaReasoner, an LLM-agnostic plugin designed for any LLM to automate adaptive reasoning configurations for tasks requiring different types of thinking. AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration strategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for reasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by theoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear policy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it consistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution robustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored prompts.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.

Abstract: A proposition that connects randomness and compression is put forward via Gibbs entropy over set of measurement vectors associated with a compression process. The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, via so-called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appears in iterative fashion and acts as a smart neural architecture search, The experiments demonstrated the utility of this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated the so-called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, the DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy- and resource-efficient deep learning training.

Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds, surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local* minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications include generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a state-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a novel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our analysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new, potentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda regret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).

<title>What Makes Treatment Effects Identifiable? Characterizations and Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04194</link>

arXiv:2506.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.
  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational studies with complex treatment mechanisms.

Abstract: The growing gap between the increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) and the limited computational budgets of edge devices poses a key challenge for efficient on-device inference, despite gradual improvements in hardware capabilities. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency of verification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple devices. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: 2.2 more system throughput, 2.8 more system capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

Abstract: This paper systematizes research on auditing Differential Privacy (DP) techniques, aiming to identify key insights into the current state of the art and open challenges. First, we introduce a comprehensive framework for reviewing work in the field and establish three cross-contextual desiderata that DP audits should target--namely, efficiency, end-to-end-ness, and tightness. Then, we systematize the modes of operation of state-of-the-art DP auditing techniques, including threat models, attacks, and evaluation functions. This allows us to highlight key details overlooked by prior work, analyze the limiting factors to achieving the three desiderata, and identify open research problems. Overall, our work provides a reusable and systematic methodology geared to assess progress in the field and identify friction points and future directions for our community to focus on.

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen, Mistral, and Llama families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is unavailable.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky. Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1.

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts, when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between their guiding parameters.

<div> Keywords: continuous normalizing flows, diffusion models, transformer-based architecture, latent variable modeling, image generation

Summary:
In this study, a novel approach is proposed to improve the efficiency of sampling in continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models by dynamically controlling the quality-complexity tradeoff. By rewiring the blocks in a transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ordinary differential equation, the sampling process can be optimized in terms of time steps and the length of the neural network. The proposed ODE_t (ODE_l) approach allows for arbitrary numbers of time steps and transformer blocks, resulting in decreased latency and memory usage compared to existing methods. Experimental results on image generation tasks demonstrate a latency reduction of up to 3 times and a FID score improvement of up to 3.5 points for high-quality sampling on datasets such as CelebA-HQ and ImageNet. The code and model weights are publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our $\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully reproducible experiments.

<div> Keywords: text-to-text regression, resource efficiency, Borg, encoder-decoder, uncertainty quantification

Summary:
Text-to-text regression is proposed as a scalable alternative to traditional tabular regression for predicting metric outcomes in complex systems data. In a study focused on predicting resource efficiency on Google's Borg scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder model achieved near perfect rank correlation and significantly lower mean squared error compared to tabular approaches. The model demonstrated the ability to adapt to new tasks with few-shot examples and accurately capture complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies emphasized the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's ability for uncertainty quantification. These findings suggest the potential for universal simulators of real-world outcomes.

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However, such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization, achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal simulators of real-world outcomes.

Summary:
The article introduces Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), a framework that combines traditional IRT models with federated learning techniques to estimate latent abilities and item difficulty in a distributed and privacy-protecting manner. The proposed FedIRT framework allows for accurate estimation of IRT models without centralizing all individual response data, offering privacy protection and reduced communication costs. Numerical experiments show that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy similar to standard IRT estimation methods. The framework is validated using a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in educational contexts. FedIRT extends the applicability of IRT to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments, without compromising accuracy or security. An open-source R package, FedIRT, is provided to facilitate practical adoption and implementation of the framework. <div>

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework, Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments, without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

<div> Keywords: Neuro-fuzzy networks, gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation, parameter optimization, structure optimization, online reinforcement learning

Summary:
Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are function approximations that use linguistic IF-THEN rules, offering transparency and universality. However, designing NFNs efficiently has been a challenge as existing methods often separate parameter and structural identification, leading to suboptimal architectures. A new approach, gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation, concurrently optimizes NFNs' parameters and structure, enabling previously inaccessible settings like online reinforcement learning for vision-based tasks. Empirical evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing NFNs trained through online reinforcement learning to excel at playing challenging scenarios in the video game DOOM. This innovative method allows for more efficient and powerful optimization of NFNs, enhancing their performance in various applications.

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs' parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a vision-based video game called DOOM.

Summary:
Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO) introduces a novel approach to address the challenges of sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in multi-task domains. The framework integrates an implicit world model that predicts task outcomes without observation reconstruction and employs a hybrid exploration strategy combining model-based planning and model-free uncertainty bonuses. By leveraging discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates, M3PO guides exploration effectively while ensuring stable policy updates through a trust-region optimizer. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off present in prior methods and provides a robust alternative to existing model-based policy optimization approaches. M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness in addressing key issues in reinforcement learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations, while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Summary:
Graph foundation models using graph neural networks show promise in sustainable and efficient atomistic modeling. Recent studies have utilized multi-task learning to handle multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training. This approach involves shared message passing layers processing input atomistic structures before routing them to multiple decoding heads for data-specific output predictions. The method stabilizes pre-training and improves a model's transferability. Initial results on four million structures have been positive, but concerns remain regarding generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable, efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, symbolic structures, Wasserstein gradient flow, group invariance, neurosymbolic systems<br />

Summary: 
The article introduces a theoretical framework demonstrating how discrete symbolic structures can naturally emerge from continuous neural network training dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, the study shows that under geometric constraints such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two simultaneous phenomena: a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories and a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potential functions encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. Data scaling laws are established for realizing symbolic tasks, connecting representational capacity to group invariance. This framework provides insights for designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Forward-mode automatic differentiation, zero-order optimization, backpropagation, memory-efficient, model training

Summary: 
Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order optimization (ZO) have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation. However, a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants and a unified theoretical analysis have hindered their practical benefits. The theoretical analysis shows that FmAD and ZO, while reducing memory usage, incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and computation compared to BP with checkpointing. Empirical experiments on large language and vision-language models confirm that BP with checkpointing outperforms FmAD and ZO methods in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and computation efficiency at comparable memory usage. The results underscore the fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as the most effective strategy for model training in memory-constrained settings. The code is available for reference on GitHub.

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO) optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps: a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and 3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained settings.

Partial observations are common in studying systems, and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism is utilized for deterministic systems. This work explores the impact of partial observation in stochastic systems using the Koopman operator theory. It highlights the significance of distinguishing between the state space and function space in stochastic systems. The delay embedding technique proves beneficial for partial observation even in stochastic systems. Numerical experiments reveal a power-law accuracy behavior for the additive noise amplitude, with the exponent of the power-law behavior indicating the effects of partial observation.

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems, the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems. Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the effects of partial observation.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises, providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to 98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling smoother and more robust optimization. These results demonstrate that geometric meta-conditioning can mitigate barren plateaus and ill-conditioning, providing a scalable approach to enhance trainability and generalization in quantum machine learning.

Summary: 
The proposed physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm does not require real-world events data for training. It generates DAS events data by modeling target events and constraints of the real world and DAS system, then utilizes a generative network to train a DAS debackground net that removes background noise in DAS data. This approach achieved comparable or better performance in event identification and belt conveyor fault monitoring applications, even without labeled real-world data for training. The paradigm's introduction of physical information and noise removal capability allows for generalization across different sites within the same application. In a belt conveyor fault diagnosis scenario, a fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% was achieved using networks transferred from a simulation test site without any actual fault events data from the test site and field for training. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to challenges related to data acquisition and noise in practical DAS applications, opening up new possibilities in various fields for DAS technology.

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising. Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore more potential fields for DAS.

Summary:
- In the realm of online advertising, advertisers use ad auctions and auto-bidding tools to secure advertising slots.
- The Decision Transformer (DT) is applied to automate bidding systems and capture long-term dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior.
- Challenges of conventional DT include the need for a preset return-to-go (RTG) value and the restriction of the learned policy by mixed-quality training data.
- The R* Decision Transformer (R* DT) is introduced to address these challenges through a three-step process: R DT, R^ DT, and R* DT.
- R* DT improves the RTG of trajectories in the training data and guides the suboptimal policy towards optimality, as validated by comprehensive tests on a publicly available bidding dataset.

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless, conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data, which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges, we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT, we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator) to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Summary:
SceneDiffuser++ is introduced as a novel approach for city-scale traffic simulation in autonomous vehicle testing. The goal is to generate synthetic miles to augment real-world testing. CitySim envisions a generative simulated city where an AV can navigate from point A to point B seamlessly. SceneDiffuser++ integrates scene generation, agent behavior modeling, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation, and environment simulation in a single model. It is the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function for point-to-point simulation. The model is demonstrated on a larger scale map using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, showcasing superior realism in long simulation scenarios. This advancement addresses the need for comprehensive simulation technologies to enhance AV testing and validation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to support trip-level simulation.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new probabilistic semiparametric model that utilizes data binning to reduce computational costs in kernel density estimation for nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional probability distributions, sparse binned kernel density estimation and Fourier kernel density estimation, are proposed for binned semiparametric Bayesian networks. These distributions address the curse of dimensionality by using sparse tensors and limiting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability calculations. Through complexity analysis and comparative experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets, the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks demonstrate structural learning and log-likelihood estimations comparable to non-binned models but with significantly faster processing times. The results indicate that these binned models are a dependable and more efficient alternative to their non-binned counterparts. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Summary:
The paper presents a graph-aware state space model for time series data over graphs, focusing on applications like urban water networks and networked neuroscience. The model incorporates both the latent state and observation equation as parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters. The state equation follows a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graph edges, allowing for flexibility in modeling uncertainties and increasing degrees of freedom. The observation model captures multi-hop neighboring influence by sampling and graph-filtering the state. Parameters in both the state and observation models are learned from partially observed data for tasks like prediction and imputation. The model is initially inferred using maximum likelihood but is later improved through a deep learning architecture that jointly learns parameters and tracks the state, akin to Kalman neural networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

<div> Keywords: offline reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning, reward function, policy learning, training dataset

Summary: 
TROFI is a new approach for offline reinforcement learning that learns a reward function from human preferences to label the training dataset, enabling policy learning without a pre-defined reward function. Experimental results on D4RL benchmark and a 3D game environment demonstrate TROFI's superior performance over baselines and comparable results to using ground truth reward. The study emphasizes the importance of a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function for aligning the value function to actual future rewards. TROFI's innovative method of using human preferences for reward function learning showcases its effectiveness in scenarios where reward functions are not readily available. <div>
arXiv:2506.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements, multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized, lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

<div> Keywords: Time Series Foundation Models, forecasting, covariate adaptation, heterogeneous data, attention mechanism 

Summary: 

Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown success in forecasting tasks but are limited by their focus on real-valued series. The proposed Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA) framework aims to bridge this gap by handling diverse covariates in forecasting, including categorical variables and multimodal data. UniCA first standardizes heterogeneous covariates into homogeneous representations and then integrates them using an attention-based fusion mechanism. This approach is adaptable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, enhancing TSFM's generalization ability while incorporating additional covariate information. Experimental results on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of UniCA in real-world scenarios, showing the potential of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation. The code for UniCA is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios. Codes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.

Summary: 
The article introduces Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS) as a technique to improve the performance of Large Language Models using the Pre-LayerNorm Transformer architecture. The Pre-LN architecture suffers from activation variance issues that limit the learning capacity of deeper layers. GPAS addresses this problem by scaling down intermediate activations while preserving gradients, preventing information loss and avoiding gradient vanishing. Experiments conducted across different model sizes demonstrate that GPAS consistently enhances model performance. The technique shows promise not only for Pre-LN Transformers but also for alternative architectures like Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm, indicating its versatility in improving training dynamics across various settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series, predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers, causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training dynamics in a wide range of settings.

This research proposes a hybrid deep learning and machine learning model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for cryptocurrency price prediction. The LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in historical price data, while XGBoost enhances prediction by modeling nonlinear relationships with auxiliary features such as sentiment scores and macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Min-Max Normalized Root Mean Square Error (MinMax RMSE) demonstrates that the LSTM+XGBoost hybrid consistently outperforms standalone models and traditional forecasting methods. This study underscores the potential of hybrid architectures in financial forecasting and provides insights into model adaptability across different cryptocurrencies and market contexts.

It examines how Transformers can be seen as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers captures the relative importance of tokens to each other, while positional encodings provide information about sequential ordering or structure. Transformers are described as expressive set processing networks that can learn relationships among input elements without predefined graphs. Despite their similarities to GNNs, Transformers are implemented using dense matrix operations, making them more hardware-efficient than sparse message passing. The perspective is offered that Transformers are GNNs currently benefiting from efficient hardware utilization. <div>

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing networks that learn relationships among input elements without being constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs, Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware lottery.

Summary:
Neural networks are utilized in this study to tackle multi-objective routing on multigraphs, a concept that has not received much attention despite its practical importance. Two neural approaches are introduced in the research: one that works directly on the multigraph by selecting edges sequentially to complete a tour, and another that simplifies the multigraph into a simple graph before building routes. Experimental validation shows that both models exhibit strong performance in solving problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This study highlights the potential of neural networks in optimizing routing decisions on complex multigraph structures, demonstrating their effectiveness in addressing practical routing challenges. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However, the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).

Summary:
Using deep learning, a new model has been developed to simplify the assessment of heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports. The traditional method of assessing pollution involves laborious procedures and data analysis of sediment samples. This new approach tackles data scarcity issues in the water-sediment domain by leveraging transfer learning to predict Pollution Load Index (PLI). The model was tested using data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia, resulting in significantly lower Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error compared to other models. The proposed model offers a more accurate, accessible, and cost-effective way of predicting water quality, which can benefit marine life conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations. By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties, underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification, especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of earthquake damage prediction.

Summary:
The article introduces a parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This method allows for the design of control laws without constraints on system structure or controller form. A Thompson sampling framework is proposed for exploring optimal control laws, with theoretical guarantees on convergence and control regret. The proposed approach is shown to learn the relationship between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential rate. Numerical experiments on unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness of the method. <div>
arXiv:2506.22186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach. Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws, and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Summary: 
Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems show promise in accelerating drug discovery. This study examines the interchangeability of LLM-based agentic system components for drug discovery, including the performance of different LLMs and tool-calling versus code-generating agents. LLMs such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o outperform others like Llama-3.1-8B and GPT-3.5-Turbo in orchestrating chemistry tools. While code-generating agents generally outperform tool-calling agents, the effectiveness varies based on the question and model used. Additionally, replacing system prompts impacts performance, emphasizing the importance of prompt re-engineering. Further research into agentic system modularity is necessary for stable and scalable solutions in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery applications. We compare the performance of different large language models (LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage, which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types, tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning, and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities for efficient and scalable learning.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for storing structured information. Consequently, predictive tasks leveraging this data format hold significant application promise. Recently, Relational Deep Learning (RDL) has emerged as a novel paradigm wherein RDBs are conceptualized as graph structures, enabling the application of various graph neural architectures to effectively address these tasks. However, given its novelty, there is a lack of analysis into the relationships between the performance of various RDL models and the characteristics of the underlying RDBs.
  In this study, we present REDELEX$-$a comprehensive exploration framework for evaluating RDL models of varying complexity on the most diverse collection of over 70 RDBs, which we make available to the community. Benchmarked alongside key representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior performance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping performance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural properties.

Summary:
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has limitations in exploration, sample efficiency, and stability in complex reasoning tasks. In response, the EFRame framework enhances GRPO by incorporating exploration, filtering, and replay mechanisms. EFRame conducts additional exploration through rollouts, filters out low-quality samples to reduce noise and variance, and utilizes experience replay for efficient learning. This framework establishes a structured learning cycle from exploration to convergence, leading to improved training robustness and efficiency. EFRame enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities, surpassing the limitations of vanilla GRPO. Additionally, EFRame allows for a more detailed analysis of the contribution of different types of samples to the learning process in reinforcement learning. The code for EFRame is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL.

Summary:<br />
Decision making in uncertain environments involves maximizing expected reward and minimizing risk. This study introduces a novel approach in stochastic bandit optimization that considers both aspects simultaneously. The goal is to identify the Pareto-optimal arms that balance expected performance and risk effectively. A unified meta-algorithmic framework is proposed to address this problem under fixed-confidence and fixed-budget scenarios, with adaptive confidence interval design for each case. Theoretical guarantees on solution correctness are provided for both settings. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks show that the proposed approach surpasses existing methods in accuracy and sample efficiency. This research demonstrates the applicability of risk-aware decision-making strategies in uncertain environments. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making: maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making tasks in uncertain environments.

Summary: 
Projected Compression is a novel model compression technique that reduces model weights by using projection modules. This method involves training additional trainable projection weights and merging them into a lower-dimensional product matrix to create a smaller standard Transformer-based model without sacrificing performance. Unlike other compression methods that require extra computational overhead, Projected Compression matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs. Experimental results demonstrate that Projected Compression outperforms traditional hard pruning and retraining approaches, especially on higher quality models. Furthermore, the advantage of Projected Compression increases with the number of tokens, indicating scalability and efficiency in reducing model size while maintaining performance. <div>

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters. Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs. Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel approach to tensor decomposition that does not rely on predefined structural assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. The proposed model uses a neural network to learn an energy function and optimize it through score matching, allowing for flexibility in modeling relationships between tensors and shared factors. By integrating the block coordinate descent algorithm with smooth regularization, the model can perform tensor completion and denoising tasks effectively. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance across various types of tensors, including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data. This approach offers a more flexible and accurate method for multiway data analysis without the need for prior knowledge of the optimal rank structure or contraction rules. <div>
arXiv:2506.22295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue, we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types, including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

Summary:
The paper introduces CoATA, a dual-channel Graph Neural Network framework designed to address the issue of noise and incompleteness in real-world graphs by jointly augmenting and refining both the topology structures and node attributes. CoATA first enriches and denoises node attributes using structural signals, then refines the attribute space by projecting it into a bipartite graph for further structure reconstruction. It employs contrastive learning with prototype alignment and consistency constraints to improve mutual corrections between the augmented and original graphs. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoATA surpasses eleven baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes.

- A proposed weakly-supervised domain adaptation method leverages class proportion information from the target domain.
- The method assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled target data based on class proportion, improving performance without additional annotations.
- Experiments on endoscopic datasets show that the method outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even with only 5% of the target domain labeled.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form, one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative modeling.

<div> Keywords: Greedy Equivalence Search, causal discovery, Less Greedy Equivalence Search, observational data, interventional data

Summary:
Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES) is a modified version of Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) designed to improve computational efficiency and accuracy in causal discovery from observational data. By avoiding edge insertions implied by conditional independence in the scoring, LGES achieves up to a 10-fold speed-up compared to GES while reducing structural errors. LGES can incorporate prior assumptions and adjust them based on data contradictions, as well as utilize interventional data to enhance the learned equivalence class. The algorithm guarantees recovery of the true equivalence class in the sample limit, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified assumptions. The code for LGES is publicly available for further research and development.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.22331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at https://github.com/CausalAILab/lges.

A realistic synthetic financial dataset with DP guarantees is used in the demonstration, showing its value in epidemic analyses.

arXiv:2506.22342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting, development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, physics-informed inductive biases, symbolic approach, neuro-symbolic integration, indoor navigation

Summary: 
This study introduces a symbolic approach called physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) for enhancing reinforcement learning (RL) agents in physical control tasks. By distilling physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents using a domain-specific language (DSL), the framework aims to improve sample efficiency and generalization. The PiPRL framework integrates symbolic programming, neural perception modules, and a low-level neural controller to leverage physics priors in indoor navigation tasks. Through a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, PiPRL outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies, reducing training time by over 26%. The framework addresses the challenge of incorporating physics priors in RL agents by providing a human-readable and explainable DSL that guides the RL process. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using symbolic approaches to incorporate physics priors in RL systems.

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks, inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

Summary: 
The article introduces Sheaf-DMFL, a decentralized multimodal learning framework using sheaf theory to improve collaboration among edge devices with diverse sensory modalities. Each client has local feature encoders for different modalities, working collaboratively across clients. Sheaf-based structures capture correlations among clients' task-specific layers. An enhanced algorithm, Sheaf-DMFL-Att, integrates an attention mechanism to capture cross-modal correlations within each client. Theoretical convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided.

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

Summary: 
The article introduces a probabilistic framework for optimizing inference-time scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches lack a principled foundation for parallel sampling, resulting in inefficient reasoning performance. The proposed framework formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling based on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) parallel samples. By deriving a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, the framework offers guidance for compute-efficient scaling. The algorithm, \textsc{OptScale}, dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses using a language model-based predictor. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that \textsc{OptScale} reduces sampling overhead while maintaining or improving reasoning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. This work provides a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for enhancing the efficient deployment of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop \textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

<div> Keywords: distributed neural architectures, vision, language, computation efficiency, training

Summary: 
Distributed Neural Architectures (DNAs) are introduced and trained in vision and language domains. DNAs consist of modules and routers where tokens can traverse modules in any order. They generalize sparse methods like Mixture-of-Experts and Mixture-of-Depths. During training, DNAs learn computation and communication patterns based on token content and context. These patterns can be shaped for efficiency or load balancing. Empirical results show DNAs are competitive with dense baselines and can learn compute efficiency from data. The paths tokens take through DNAs follow a distributed power-law distribution. Some paths show specialization. Models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable manner. <div>

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.

<div> optimistic regularization, exploration, exploitation, value-incentivized actor-critic, regret guarantees

Summary:
The paper introduces a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method for online reinforcement learning with complex function approximations. The method aims to balance exploration and exploitation by optimizing a single objective that encourages consistent state-action and policy estimates while maximizing value functions. Through the lens of primal-dual optimization, the principle of optimism is interpreted to provide a fresh perspective on exploration strategies. The VAC method is shown to have near-optimal regret guarantees in linear Markov decision processes for both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings. These guarantees can be extended to the general function approximation setting under suitable assumptions. The proposed method addresses the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning with complex function approximations, providing a practical and theoretically sound approach supported by regret guarantees.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance, balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method, which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

<title>ARMOR: Robust Reinforcement Learning-based Control for UAVs under Physical Attacks</title>

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception, navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations), an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the need for iterative adversarial training.

<title>CLoVE: Personalized Federated Learning through Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings</title>

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings, and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and unsupervised PFL tasks.

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68 points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile, several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea. Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MMLU-CF.

<title>Data Efficacy for Language Model Training</title>

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts" on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own research.

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models (LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000 sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites. BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of 5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level, real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition, the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78. BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will be made available via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/amirap80/BioPars.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language models to time series forecasting under various design choices including upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions leveraged by these models.

<title>Instruction Learning Paradigms: A Dual Perspective on White-box and Black-box LLMs</title>

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity, boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures, the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a 3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple topics.

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes, such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%, $-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

<title>Representation Consistency for Accurate and Coherent LLM Answer Aggregation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21590</link>

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.

<title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Next POI Recommendation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21599</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models. Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches, identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability, considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and trustworthy AES methods.

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships between technical metrics and user-centric trust measures. Evaluation reveals that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25% caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.

<title>CORE-KG: An LLM-Driven Knowledge Graph Construction Framework for Human Smuggling Networks</title>

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations, and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG, a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential, structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.

<title>Does Multimodality Lead to Better Time Series Forecasting?</title>

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced text classification by enabling automated understanding and categorization of complex, unstructured textual data. However, accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and contextual variations inherent in natural language, particularly within consumer complaints, remains a challenge. This study addresses these issues by incorporating human-experience-trained algorithms that effectively recognize subtle semantic differences crucial for assessing consumer relief eligibility. Furthermore, we propose integrating synthetic data generation methods that utilize expert evaluations of generative adversarial networks and are refined through expert annotations. By combining expert-trained classifiers with high-quality synthetic data, our research seeks to significantly enhance machine learning classifier performance, reduce dataset acquisition costs, and improve overall evaluation metrics and robustness in text classification tasks.

Abstract: The Deep and Cross architecture (DCNv2) is a robust production baseline and is integral to numerous real-life recommender systems. Its inherent efficiency and ability to model interactions often result in models that are both simpler and highly competitive compared to more computationally demanding alternatives, such as Deep FFMs. In this work, we introduce three significant algorithmic improvements to the DCNv2 architecture, detailing their formulation and behavior at scale. The enhanced architecture we refer to as DCN^2 is actively used in a live recommender system, processing over 0.5 billion predictions per second across diverse use cases where it out-performed DCNv2, both offline and online (ab tests). These improvements effectively address key limitations observed in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit management of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit modeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs' behavior. The superior performance of DCN^2 is also demonstrated on four publicly available benchmark data sets.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including 128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements -- collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance zero-shot LLM performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance. Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling, especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.

Abstract: Authors Yi-Cheng Chen, Ping-En Lu, Cheng-Shang Chang, and Tzu-Hsuan Liu use the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) linear system filtering method to track and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19, in a pandemic context in which there was still no vaccine and the only way to avoid contagion was isolation. To estimate the coefficients of these FIR filters, Chen et al. used machine learning methods through a classical optimization problem with regularization (ridge regression). These estimated coefficients are called ridge coefficients. The epidemic mathematical model adopted by these researchers to formulate the FIR filters is the time-dependent discrete SIR. In this paper, we propose a small modification to the algorithm of Chen et al. to obtain the ridge coefficients. We then used this modified algorithm to track and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19 in the state of Minas Gerais/Brazil, within a prediction window, during the initial period of the pandemic. We also compare the predicted data with the respective real data to check how good the approximation is. In the modified algorithm, we set values for the FIR filter orders and for the regularization parameters, both different from the respective values defined by Chen et al. in their algorithm. In this context, the numerical results obtained by the modified algorithm in some simulations present better approximation errors compared to the respective approximation errors presented by the algorithm of Chen et al.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models represent an entirely new class of generative AI methods that have yet to be fully explored. Critical damping has been successfully introduced in Critically-Damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD) and Critically-Damped Third-Order Langevin Dynamics (TOLD++), but has not yet been applied to dynamics of arbitrary order. The proposed line of work generalizes Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics (HOLD), a recent state-of-the-art diffusion method, by introducing the concept of critical damping from systems analysis.

Abstract: Storm surge forecasting plays a crucial role in coastal disaster preparedness, yet existing machine learning approaches often suffer from limited spatial resolution, reliance on coastal station data, and poor generalization. Moreover, many prior models operate directly on unstructured spatial data, making them incompatible with modern deep learning architectures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that projects unstructured water elevation fields onto structured Red Green Blue (RGB)-encoded image representations, enabling the application of Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) networks for end-to-end spatiotemporal surge forecasting. Our model further integrates ground-truth wind fields as dynamic conditioning signals and topo-bathymetry as a static input, capturing physically meaningful drivers of surge evolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of synthetic storms in the Gulf of Mexico, our method demonstrates robust 48-hour forecasting performance across multiple regions along the Texas coast and exhibits strong spatial extensibility to other coastal areas. By combining structured representation, physically grounded forcings, and scalable deep learning, this study advances the frontier of storm surge forecasting in usability, adaptability, and interpretability.

<title>Inverse Design of Diffractive Metasurfaces Using Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator, we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms. Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally, we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained diffusion models, including EDM, EDM2, and Stable-Diffusion 3, which cover models in both pixel and latent spaces, as well as class and text conditional settings.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA, and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical utility.

Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline is proposed.

<title>Offensive Language Detection on Social Media Using XLNet</title>

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats, comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

<title>Classification with Reject Option: Distribution-free Error Guarantees via Conformal Prediction</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models always make a prediction, even when they are likely to be wrong. This causes problems in practical applications, as we do not know if we should trust a prediction. ML with reject option addresses this issue by abstaining from making a prediction if it is likely to be incorrect. In this work, we formalise the approach to ML with reject option in binary classification, deriving theoretical guarantees on the resulting error rate. This is achieved through conformal prediction (CP), which produce prediction sets with distribution-free validity guarantees. In binary classification, CP can output prediction sets containing exactly one, two or no labels. By accepting only the singleton predictions, we turn CP into a binary classifier with reject option.
  Here, CP is formally put in the framework of predicting with reject option. We state and prove the resulting error rate, and give finite sample estimates. Numerical examples provide illustrations of derived error rate through several different conformal prediction settings, ranging from full conformal prediction to offline batch inductive conformal prediction. The former has a direct link to sharp validity guarantees, whereas the latter is more fuzzy in terms of validity guarantees but can be used in practice. Error-reject curves illustrate the trade-off between error rate and reject rate, and can serve to aid a user to set an acceptable error rate or reject rate in practice.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP, a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token, beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph (CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model, CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy. A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving +5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20% in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3% for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- & 5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations, advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/few-shot-map-segmentation.

Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans. Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined, including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in prenatal care.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models. Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks. Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership, and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures. However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks, and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving adversarial landscapes.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis. We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL), highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation. These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods. Project page: https://www.factral.co/UnMix-NeRF.

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component, T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence, enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more effective DMs.

Abstract: We propose an extension of Thompson sampling to optimization problems over function spaces where the objective is a known functional of an unknown operator's output. We assume that functional evaluations are inexpensive, while queries to the operator (such as running a high-fidelity simulator) are costly. Our algorithm employs a sample-then-optimize approach using neural operator surrogates. This strategy avoids explicit uncertainty quantification by treating trained neural operators as approximate samples from a Gaussian process. We provide novel theoretical convergence guarantees, based on Gaussian processes in the infinite-dimensional setting, under minimal assumptions. We benchmark our method against existing baselines on functional optimization tasks involving partial differential equations and other nonlinear operator-driven phenomena, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and competitive performance.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems are facing increasing demands for real-time and intelligent task scheduling. In such systems, task offloading and resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task structures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic and complex low-altitude economic network environments.

Abstract: Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over 63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated with hitchwiki.org and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution, seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a transportation practice and cultural phenomenon.

<title>More Vulnerable than You Think: On the Stability of Tool-Integrated LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for future LLM development and evaluation.

<title>Advancing Jailbreak Strategies: A Hybrid Approach to Exploiting LLM Vulnerabilities and Bypassing Modern Defenses</title>

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications. Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks. Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's 58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85 minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance, utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the proposed normalization scheme).

<title>Tied Prototype Model for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes. However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model (TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features. Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or "circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g. "Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

<title>Visual Structures Helps Visual Reasoning: Addressing the Binding Problem in VLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Abstract: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport. These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source, high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities, including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents. Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets. The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.

<title>Hybrid Generative Modeling for Incomplete Physics: Deep Grey-Box Meets Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: Physics phenomena are often described by ordinary and/or partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs), and solved analytically or numerically. Unfortunately, many real-world systems are described only approximately with missing or unknown terms in the equations. This makes the distribution of the physics model differ from the true data-generating process (DGP). Using limited and unpaired data between DGP observations and the imperfect model simulations, we investigate this particular setting by completing the known-physics model, combining theory-driven models and data-driven to describe the shifted distribution involved in the DGP. We present a novel hybrid generative model approach combining deep grey-box modelling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods to enhance incomplete physics models. Our method implements OT maps in data space while maintaining minimal source distribution distortion, demonstrating superior performance in resolving the unpaired problem and ensuring correct usage of physics parameters. Unlike black-box alternatives, our approach leverages physics-based inductive biases to accurately learn system dynamics while preserving interpretability through its domain knowledge foundation. Experimental results validate our method's effectiveness in both generation tasks and model transparency, offering detailed insights into learned physics dynamics.

<title>Uncovering smooth structures in single-cell data with PCS-guided neighbor embeddings</title>

Abstract: Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth, low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP, are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions. But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts, quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

Abstract: The integration of the history and philosophy of statistics was initiated at least by Hacking (1965) and advanced by Mayo (1996), but it has not received sustained follow-up. Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the recent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine learning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the boundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What we now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of the field they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study of a philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose root can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and Pearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic). This leads to the articulation of a foundational assumption -- largely implicit in, but shared by, the practices of frequentist statistics and machine learning -- which I call achievabilism. Another integration also emerges at the level of methodology, combining two ends of the philosophy of science spectrum: history and philosophy of science on the one hand, and formal epistemology on the other hand.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for a low parameter cost.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution. In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words, quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems. Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion $GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes, unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation, where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning (SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate. In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second, DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality loss.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.

<title>Beyond ReLU: How Activations Affect Neural Kernels and Random Wide Networks</title>

Abstract: While the theory of deep learning has made some progress in recent years, much of it is limited to the ReLU activation function. In particular, while the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and neural network Gaussian process kernel (NNGP) have given theoreticians tractable limiting cases of fully connected neural networks, their properties for most activation functions except for powers of the ReLU function are poorly understood. Our main contribution is to provide a more general characterization of the RKHS of these kernels for typical activation functions whose only non-smoothness is at zero, such as SELU, ELU, or LeakyReLU. Our analysis also covers a broad set of special cases such as missing biases, two-layer networks, or polynomial activations. Our results show that a broad class of not infinitely smooth activations generate equivalent RKHSs at different network depths, while polynomial activations generate non-equivalent RKHSs. Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP sample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks at initialization.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research on deep interpretable neural networks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools. There are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic regression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are based on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an extensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our method performs on par or better than existing decision models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for identifying test samples that deviate from in-distribution (ID) data, ensuring network robustness and reliability. This paper presents a flexible framework for OOD knowledge distillation that extracts OOD-sensitive information from a network to develop a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between ID and OOD samples in both scenarios, with and without access to training ID data. To accomplish this, we introduce Confidence Amendment (CA), an innovative methodology that transforms an OOD sample into an ID one while progressively amending prediction confidence derived from the network to enhance OOD sensitivity. This approach enables the simultaneous synthesis of both ID and OOD samples, each accompanied by an adjusted prediction confidence, thereby facilitating the training of a binary classifier sensitive to OOD. Theoretical analysis provides bounds on the generalization error of the binary classifier, demonstrating the pivotal role of confidence amendment in enhancing OOD sensitivity. Extensive experiments spanning various datasets and network architectures confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting OOD samples.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios.However, system and statistical challenges hinder its real-world applicability, requiring efficient learning from edge devices and robustness to data heterogeneity. Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches often degrade severely due to the joint effect of heterogeneity and partial client participation. In particular, while momentum appears as a promising approach for overcoming statistical heterogeneity, in current approaches its update is biased towards the most recently sampled clients. As we show in this work, this is the reason why it fails to outperform FedAvg, preventing its effective use in real-world large-scale scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM) and theoretically prove it enables convergence under unbounded data heterogeneity in cyclic partial participation, thereby advancing the understanding of momentum's effectiveness in FL. We then introduce adaptive and communication-efficient variants of GHBM that match the communication complexity of FedAvg in settings where clients can be stateful. Extensive experiments on vision and language tasks confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that GHBM substantially improves state-of-the-art performance under random uniform client sampling, particularly in large-scale settings with high data heterogeneity and low client participation. Code is available at https://rickzack.github.io/GHBM.

Abstract: The estimation of probability density functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. However, common methods such as kernel density estimation (KDE) have been demonstrated to lack robustness, while more complex methods have not been evaluated in multi-modal estimation problems. In this paper, we present ROME (RObust Multi-modal Estimator), a non-parametric approach for density estimation which addresses the challenge of estimating multi-modal, non-normal, and highly correlated distributions. ROME utilizes clustering to segment a multi-modal set of samples into multiple uni-modal ones and then combines simple KDE estimates obtained for individual clusters in a single multi-modal estimate. We compared our approach to state-of-the-art methods for density estimation as well as ablations of ROME, showing that it not only outperforms established methods but is also more robust to a variety of distributions. Our results demonstrate that ROME can overcome the issues of over-fitting and over-smoothing exhibited by other estimators.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning aims to capture the underlying structure of potentially large and high-dimensional datasets. Traditionally, this involves using dimensionality reduction (DR) methods to project data onto lower-dimensional spaces or organizing points into meaningful clusters (clustering). In this work, we revisit these approaches under the lens of optimal transport and exhibit relationships with the Gromov-Wasserstein problem. This unveils a new general framework, called distributional reduction, that recovers DR and clustering as special cases and allows addressing them jointly within a single optimization problem. We empirically demonstrate its relevance to the identification of low-dimensional prototypes representing data at different scales, across multiple image and genomic datasets.

Abstract: The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification. The code and appendix are available at https://github.com/difra100/Link_Prediction_with_PIGNN_IJCNN.

Abstract: Linearization of attention using various kernel approximation and kernel learning techniques has shown promise. Past methods used a subset of combinations of component functions and weight matrices within the random feature paradigm. We identify the need for a systematic comparison of different combinations of weight matrices and component functions for attention learning in Transformer. Hence, we introduce Spectraformer, a unified framework for approximating and learning the kernel function in the attention mechanism of the Transformer. Our empirical results demonstrate, for the first time, that a random feature-based approach can achieve performance comparable to top-performing sparse and low-rank methods on the challenging Long Range Arena benchmark. Thus, we establish a new state-of-the-art for random feature-based efficient Transformers. The framework also produces many variants that offer different advantages in accuracy, training time, and memory consumption. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/spectraformer .

Abstract: Among various aspects of ensuring the responsible design of AI tools for healthcare applications, addressing fairness concerns has been a key focus area. Specifically, given the wide spread of electronic health record (EHR) data and their huge potential to inform a wide range of clinical decision support tasks, improving fairness in this category of health AI tools is of key importance. While such a broad problem (mitigating fairness in EHR-based AI models) has been tackled using various methods, task- and model-agnostic methods are noticeably rare. In this study, we aimed to target this gap by presenting a new pipeline that generates synthetic EHR data, which is not only consistent with (faithful to) the real EHR data but also can reduce the fairness concerns (defined by the end-user) in the downstream tasks, when combined with the real data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline across various downstream tasks and two different EHR datasets. Our proposed pipeline can add a widely applicable and complementary tool to the existing toolbox of methods to address fairness in health AI applications, such as those modifying the design of a downstream model.

Abstract: Many social programs attempt to allocate scarce resources to people with the greatest need. Indeed, public services increasingly use algorithmic risk assessments motivated by this goal. However, targeting the highest-need recipients often conflicts with attempting to evaluate the causal effect of the program as a whole, as the best evaluations would be obtained by randomizing the allocation. We propose a framework to design randomized allocation rules which optimally balance targeting high-need individuals with learning treatment effects, presenting policymakers with a Pareto frontier between the two goals. We give sample complexity guarantees for the policy learning problem and provide a computationally efficient strategy to implement it. We then collaborate with the human services department of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania to evaluate our methods on data from real service delivery settings. Optimized policies can substantially mitigate the tradeoff between learning and targeting. For example, it is often possible to obtain 90% of the optimal utility in targeting high-need individuals while ensuring that the average treatment effect can be estimated with less than 2 times the samples that a randomized controlled trial would require. Mechanisms for targeting public services often focus on measuring need as accurately as possible. However, our results suggest that algorithmic systems in public services can be most impactful if they incorporate program evaluation as an explicit goal alongside targeting.

<title>Asymmetric Graph Error Control with Low Complexity in Causal Bandits</title>

Abstract: In this paper, the causal bandit problem is investigated, with the objective of maximizing the long-term reward by selecting an optimal sequence of interventions on nodes in an unknown causal graph. It is assumed that both the causal topology and the distribution of interventions are unknown. First, based on the difference between the two types of graph identification errors (false positives and negatives), a causal graph learning method is proposed. Numerical results suggest that this method has a much lower sample complexity relative to the prior art by learning sub-graphs. However, we note that a sample complexity analysis for the new algorithm has not been undertaken, as of yet. Under the assumption of minimum-mean squared error weight estimation, a new uncertainty bound tailored to the causal bandit problem is derived. This uncertainty bound drives an upper confidence bound-based intervention selection to optimize the reward. Further, we consider a particular instance of non-stationary bandits wherein both the causal topology and interventional distributions can change. Our solution is the design of a sub-graph change detection mechanism that requires a modest number of samples. Numerical results compare the new methodology to existing schemes and show a substantial performance improvement in stationary and non-stationary settings. Averaged over 100 randomly generated causal bandits, the proposed scheme takes significantly fewer samples to learn the causal structure and achieves a reward gain of 85% compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length. Code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/jxiw/MambaInLlama and https://github.com/itsdaniele/speculative_mamba.

Abstract: Testing a hypothesized causal model against observational data is a key prerequisite for many causal inference tasks. A natural approach is to test whether the conditional independence relations (CIs) assumed in the model hold in the data. While a model can assume exponentially many CIs (with respect to the number of variables), testing all of them is both impractical and unnecessary. Causal graphs, which encode these CIs in polynomial space, give rise to local Markov properties that enable model testing with a significantly smaller subset of CIs. Model testing based on local properties requires an algorithm to list the relevant CIs. However, existing algorithms for realistic settings with hidden variables and non-parametric distributions can take exponential time to produce even a single CI constraint. In this paper, we introduce the c-component local Markov property (C-LMP) for causal graphs with hidden variables. Since C-LMP can still invoke an exponential number of CIs, we develop a polynomial delay algorithm to list these CIs in poly-time intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that enables poly-delay testing of CIs in causal graphs with hidden variables against arbitrary data distributions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is challenging for data-driven methods, as these models must adapt to variations in parameters such as coefficients, forcing terms, and initial conditions. State-of-the-art neural surrogates perform adaptation through gradient-based optimization and meta-learning to implicitly encode the variety of dynamics from observations. This often comes with increased inference complexity. Inspired by the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we introduce Zebra, a novel generative auto-regressive transformer designed to solve parametric PDEs without requiring gradient adaptation at inference. By leveraging in-context information during both pre-training and inference, Zebra dynamically adapts to new tasks by conditioning on input sequences that incorporate context example trajectories. As a generative model, Zebra can be used to generate new trajectories and allows quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. We evaluate Zebra across a variety of challenging PDE scenarios, demonstrating its adaptability, robustness, and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Generalization (DG) is preventing overfitting to source domains, which can be mitigated by finding flatter minima in the loss landscape. In this work, we propose Quantization-aware Training for Domain Generalization (QT-DoG) and demonstrate that weight quantization effectively leads to flatter minima in the loss landscape, thereby enhancing domain generalization. Unlike traditional quantization methods focused on model compression, QT-DoG exploits quantization as an implicit regularizer by inducing noise in model weights, guiding the optimization process toward flatter minima that are less sensitive to perturbations and overfitting. We provide both an analytical perspective and empirical evidence demonstrating that quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better generalization across domains. Moreover, with the benefit of reducing the model size through quantization, we demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple quantized models further yields superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art DG approaches with no computational or memory overheads. Code is released at: https://saqibjaved1.github.io/QT_DoG/.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a crucial step in improving the responsiveness of pretrained large language models (LLMs) to human instructions. Federated learning (FL) helps to exploit the use of vast private instruction data from clients, becoming popular for LLM tuning by improving data diversity. Existing federated tuning simply consumes all local data, causing excessive computational overhead and overfitting to local data, while centralized data-efficient solutions are not suitable for FL due to privacy concerns. This work presents FedHDS, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which tunes LLMs with a representative subset of edge-side data. It reduces the data redundancy at both intra- and inter-client levels without sharing raw data. Experiments with various LLMs, datasets and partitions show that FedHDS improves Rouge-L on unseen tasks by an average of 10.72% over the SOTA full-data federated instruction tuning methods, while using less than 1.5% of the data samples, improving training efficiency by up to tens of times.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, i.e., network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into prior and residual components, with the prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain. We provide code and data at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/NPDiff.

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are stochastic process models used to characterize event sequences occurring in continuous time. Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.

Abstract: We focus on reducing communication overhead in multiplayer games, where frequently exchanging strategies between players is not feasible and players have noisy or outdated strategies of the other players. We introduce Decoupled SGDA, a novel adaptation of Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA). In this approach, players independently update their strategies based on outdated opponent strategies, with periodic synchronization to align strategies. For Strongly-Convex-Strongly-Concave (SCSC) games, we demonstrate that Decoupled SGDA achieves near-optimal communication complexity comparable to the best-known GDA rates. For weakly coupled games where the interaction between players is lower relative to the non-interactive part of the game, Decoupled SGDA significantly reduces communication costs compared to standard SGDA. Our findings extend to multi-player games. To provide insights into the effect of communication frequency and convergence, we extensively study the convergence of Decoupled SGDA for quadratic minimax problems. Lastly, in settings where the noise over the players is imbalanced, Decoupled SGDA significantly outperforms federated minimax methods.

Abstract: Existing literature lacks a graph domain adaptation technique for handling large distribution shifts, primarily due to the difficulty in simulating an evolving path from source to target graph. To make a breakthrough, we present a graph gradual domain adaptation (GGDA) framework with the construction of a compact domain sequence that minimizes information loss in adaptations. Our approach starts with an efficient generation of knowledge-preserving intermediate graphs over the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric. With the bridging data pool, GGDA domains are then constructed via a novel vertex-based domain progression, which comprises "close" vertex selections and adaptive domain advancement to enhance inter-domain information transferability. Theoretically, our framework concretizes the intractable inter-domain distance $W_p(\mu_t,\mu_{t+1})$ via implementable upper and lower bounds, enabling flexible adjustments of this metric for optimizing domain formation. Extensive experiments under various transfer scenarios validate the superior performance of our GGDA framework.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown promising results for several domains such as materials science, chemistry, and the social sciences. GNN models often contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph based models, namely static and dynamic batching for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that changing the batching algorithm can provide up to a 2.7x speedup, but the fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size, hardware, and number of training steps run. Experiments show that for a select number of combinations of batch size, dataset, and model, significant differences in model learning metrics are observed between static and dynamic batching algorithms.

Abstract: It is difficult to anticipate the myriad challenges that a predictive model will encounter once deployed. Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on numerous image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed by a VLM to proactively discover, textually explain, and address conceptual gaps in a deployed predictive model.

Abstract: Novel materials drive progress across applications from energy storage to electronics. Automated characterization of material structures with machine learning methods offers a promising strategy for accelerating this key step in material design. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive language model that performs crystal structure prediction (CSP) from powder diffraction data. The presented model, deCIFer, generates crystal structures in the widely used Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format and can be conditioned on powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Unlike earlier works that primarily rely on high-level descriptors like composition, deCIFer is also able to use diffraction data to perform CSP. We train deCIFer on nearly 2.3M crystal structures and validate on diverse sets of PXRD patterns for characterizing challenging inorganic crystal systems. Qualitative checks and quantitative assessments using the residual weighted profile show that deCIFer produces structures that more accurately match the target diffraction data. Notably, deCIFer can achieve a 94% match rate on test data. deCIFer bridges experimental diffraction data with computational CSP, lending itself as a powerful tool for crystal structure characterization.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have proven effective at enhancing mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased inference-time computation. However, they are predominantly trained on mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we introduce VersaPRM, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a 7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline -- surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%. We further contribute to the community by open-sourcing all data, code and models for VersaPRM.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a computer-aided design geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.

Abstract: We address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, $\mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of $\mu$Code at utilizing the execution feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/portal-cornell/muCode.

Abstract: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.

Abstract: We consider a good arm identification problem in a stochastic bandit setting with multi-objectives, where each arm $i \in [K]$ is associated with a distribution $D_i$ defined over $R^M$. For each round $t$, the player pulls an arm $i_t$ and receives an $M$-dimensional reward vector sampled according to $D_{i_t}$. The goal is to find, with high probability, an $\epsilon$-good arm whose expected reward vector is larger than $\bm{\xi} - \epsilon \mathbf{1}$, where $\bm{\xi}$ is a predefined threshold vector, and the vector comparison is component-wise. We propose the Multi-Thresholding UCB~(MultiTUCB) algorithm with a sample complexity bound. Our bound matches the existing one in the special case where $M=1$ and $\epsilon=0$. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline approaches across synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose BeamLLM, a vision-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address the challenges of high training overhead and latency in mmWave communication systems. By combining computer vision (CV) with LLMs' cross-modal reasoning capabilities, the framework extracts user equipment (UE) positional features from RGB images and aligns visual-temporal features with LLMs' semantic space through reprogramming techniques. Evaluated on a realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, the proposed method achieves 61.01% top-1 accuracy and 97.39% top-3 accuracy in standard prediction tasks, significantly outperforming traditional deep learning models. In few-shot prediction scenarios, the performance degradation is limited to 12.56% (top-1) and 5.55% (top-3) from time sample 1 to 10, demonstrating superior prediction capability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive success across various tasks. Integrating LLMs with Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm known as FedLLM, offers a promising avenue for collaborative model adaptation while preserving data privacy. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive review of FedLLM. We begin by tracing the historical development of both LLMs and FL, summarizing relevant prior research to set the context. Subsequently, we delve into an in-depth analysis of the fundamental challenges inherent in deploying FedLLM. Addressing these challenges often requires efficient adaptation strategies; therefore, we conduct an extensive examination of existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and explore their applicability within the FL framework. To rigorously evaluate the performance of FedLLM, we undertake a thorough review of existing fine-tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. Furthermore, we discuss FedLLM's diverse real-world applications across multiple domains. Finally, we identify critical open challenges and outline promising research directions to foster future advancements in FedLLM. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, offering valuable insights into the rapidly evolving landscape of federated fine-tuning for LLMs. It also establishes a roadmap for future innovations in privacy-preserving AI. We actively maintain a GitHub repo \href{https://github.com/Clin0212/Awesome-Federated-LLM-Learning}{https://github.com/Clin0212/Awesome-Federated-LLM-Learning} to track cutting-edge advancements in this field.

Abstract: In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach, designated as Hypergraph Structure Learning with Smoothness (HSLS), addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.

Abstract: Causal inference is often portrayed as fundamentally distinct from predictive modeling, with its own terminology, goals, and intellectual challenges. But at its core, causal inference is simply a structured instance of prediction under distribution shift. In both cases, we begin with labeled data from a source domain and seek to generalize to a target domain where outcomes are not observed. The key difference is that in causal inference, the labels -- potential outcomes -- are selectively observed based on treatment assignment, introducing bias that must be addressed through assumptions. This perspective reframes causal estimation as a familiar generalization problem and highlights how techniques from predictive modeling, such as reweighting and domain adaptation, apply directly to causal tasks. It also clarifies that causal assumptions are not uniquely strong -- they are simply more explicit. By viewing causal inference through the lens of prediction, we demystify its logic, connect it to familiar tools, and make it more accessible to practitioners and educators alike.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text-to-SQL tasks. However, existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel Text-to-SQL RL fine-tuning framework named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals while significantly reducing inference time and GPU memory usage. Building on this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE) subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and structural clarity of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks, including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing reward models.

Each feature contributes independently to risk estimation through dedicated neural networks, allowing for visualization of complex non-linear relationships between covariates and each competing risk. We demonstrate competitive performance on multiple datasets compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important properties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior work has focused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as sets or multisets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data. These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function, such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether these aggregation functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions. Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general technique that allows an agent to learn an optimal policy and interact with an environment in sequential decision making problems. The goodness of a policy is measured by its value function starting from some initial state. The focus of this paper is to construct confidence intervals (CIs) for a policy's value in infinite horizon settings where the number of decision points diverges to infinity. We propose to model the action-value state function (Q-function) associated with a policy based on series/sieve method to derive its confidence interval. When the target policy depends on the observed data as well, we propose a SequentiAl Value Evaluation (SAVE) method to recursively update the estimated policy and its value estimator. As long as either the number of trajectories or the number of decision points diverges to infinity, we show that the proposed CI achieves nominal coverage even in cases where the optimal policy is not unique. Simulation studies are conducted to back up our theoretical findings. We apply the proposed method to a dataset from mobile health studies and find that reinforcement learning algorithms could help improve patient's health status. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/shengzhang37/SAVE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel generative AI (GAI)-driven, unified semi-supervised learning architecture for optimizing resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. Termed Generative Semi-Supervised VAE-Contrastive Learning, our approach maximizes the weighted user equipment (UE) throughput and allocates physical resource blocks (PRBs) to enhance the quality of service for eMBB and URLLC services. The GAI framework utilizes a dedicated xApp for intelligent power control and PRB allocation. This integrated GAI model synergistically combines the generative power of a VAE with contrastive learning to achieve robustness in an end-to-end trainable system. It is a semi-supervised training approach that concurrently optimizes supervised regression of resource allocation decisions (i.e., power, UE association, PRB) and unsupervised contrastive objectives. This intrinsic fusion improves the precision of resource management and model generalization in dynamic mobile networks. We evaluated our GAI methodology against exhaustive search and deep Q-Network algorithms using key performance metrics. Results show our integrated GAI approach offers superior efficiency and effectiveness in various scenarios, presenting a compelling GAI-based solution for critical network slicing and resource management challenges in next-generation O-RAN systems.

<title>RLSF: Fine-tuning LLMs via Symbolic Feedback</title>

arXiv:2405.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models.
  We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals.
  Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.

<title>CAPM: Fast and Robust Verification on Maxpool-based CNN via Dual Network</title>

Abstract: This study uses CAPM (Convex Adversarial Polytope for Maxpool-based CNN) to improve the verified bound for general purpose maxpool-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under bounded norm adversarial perturbations. The maxpool function is decomposed as a series of ReLU functions to extend the convex relaxation technique to maxpool functions, by which the verified bound can be efficiently computed through a dual network. The experimental results demonstrate that this technique allows the state-of-the-art verification precision for maxpool-based CNNs and involves a much lower computational cost than current verification methods, such as DeepZ, DeepPoly and PRIMA. This method is also applicable to large-scale CNNs, which previous studies show to be often computationally prohibitively expensive. Under certain circumstances, CAPM is 40-times, 20-times or twice as fast and give a significantly higher verification bound (CAPM 98% vs. PRIMA 76%/DeepPoly 73%/DeepZ 8%) as compared to PRIMA/DeepPoly/DeepZ. Furthermore, we additionally present the time complexity of our algorithm as $O(W^2NK)$, where $W$ is the maximum width of the neural network, $N$ is the number of neurons, and $K$ is the size of the maxpool layer's kernel.

Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this emerges from the collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other factors, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively and propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram and links feature learning across layers to generalization.

<title>Mitigating Metropolitan Carbon Emissions with Dynamic Eco-driving at Scale</title>

arXiv:2408.05609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.

Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.

Abstract: Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) provides finite-sample coverage guarantees, enhancing the prediction reliability under non-exchangeability. This study demonstrates that these desirable properties of ACI do not require the use of Conformal Predictors (CP). We show that the guarantees hold for the broader class of confidence predictors, defined by the requirement of producing nested prediction sets, a property we argue is essential for meaningful confidence statements. We empirically investigate the performance of Non-Conformal Confidence Predictors (NCCP) against CP when used with ACI on non-exchangeable data. In online settings, the NCCP offers significant computational advantages while maintaining a comparable predictive efficiency. In batch settings, inductive NCCP (INCCP) can outperform inductive CP (ICP) by utilising the full training dataset without requiring a separate calibration set, leading to improved efficiency, particularly when the data are limited. Although these initial results highlight NCCP as a theoretically sound and practically effective alternative to CP for uncertainty quantification with ACI in non-exchangeable scenarios, further empirical studies are warranted across diverse datasets and predictors.

<title>How to Train Long-Context Language Models (Effectively)</title>

Abstract: We study continued training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a language model (LM) to make effective use of long-context information. We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development -- instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during long-context training. Additionally, ProLong can effectively process up to 512K tokens, one of the longest context windows of publicly available LMs.

<title>Soft Condorcet Optimization for Ranking of General Agents</title>

Abstract: Driving progress of AI models and agents requires comparing their performance on standardized benchmarks; for general agents, individual performances must be aggregated across a potentially wide variety of different tasks. In this paper, we describe a novel ranking scheme inspired by social choice frameworks, called Soft Condorcet Optimization (SCO), to compute the optimal ranking of agents: the one that makes the fewest mistakes in predicting the agent comparisons in the evaluation data. This optimal ranking is the maximum likelihood estimate when evaluation data (which we view as votes) are interpreted as noisy samples from a ground truth ranking, a solution to Condorcet's original voting system criteria. SCO ratings are maximal for Condorcet winners when they exist, which we show is not necessarily true for the classical rating system Elo. We propose three optimization algorithms to compute SCO ratings and evaluate their empirical performance. When serving as an approximation to the Kemeny-Young voting method, SCO rankings are on average 0 to 0.043 away from the optimal ranking in normalized Kendall-tau distance across 865 preference profiles from the PrefLib open ranking archive. In a simulated noisy tournament setting, SCO achieves accurate approximations to the ground truth ranking and the best among several baselines when 59\% or more of the preference data is missing. Finally, SCO ranking provides the best approximation to the optimal ranking, measured on held-out test sets, in a problem containing 52,958 human players across 31,049 games of the classic seven-player game of Diplomacy.

<title>Robust Detection of Watermarks for Large Language Models Under Human Edits</title>

arXiv:2411.13868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.

arXiv:2412.03768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networked systems driven by latent inputs are common in fields like neuroscience, finance, and engineering. A key inference problem here is to learn edge connectivity from node outputs (potentials). We focus on systems governed by steady-state linear conservation laws: $X_t = {L^{\ast}}Y_{t}$, where $X_t, Y_t \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denote inputs and potentials, respectively, and the sparsity pattern of the $p \times p$ Laplacian $L^{\ast}$ encodes the edge structure. Assuming $X_t$ to be a wide-sense stationary stochastic process with a known spectral density matrix, we learn the support of $L^{\ast}$ from temporally correlated samples of $Y_t$ via an $\ell_1$-regularized Whittle's maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The regularization is particularly useful for learning large-scale networks in the high-dimensional setting where the network size $p$ significantly exceeds the number of samples $n$.
  We show that the MLE problem is strictly convex, admitting a unique solution. Under a novel mutual incoherence condition and certain sufficient conditions on $(n, p, d)$, we show that the ML estimate recovers the sparsity pattern of $L^\ast$ with high probability, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph underlying $L^{\ast}$. We provide recovery guarantees for $L^\ast$ in element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator norms. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with several simulation studies on synthetic and benchmark datasets, including engineered systems (power and water networks), and real-world datasets from neural systems (such as the human brain).

Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW. NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to 8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU (99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to 189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated with any existing efficient segmentation backbones. The code is avaialble: https://github.com/Youngseok0001/open_nmsw.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

arXiv:2501.19179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) potentials relying on chemical locality offer near-quantum mechanical accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs. Message-passing GNNs model interactions beyond their immediate neighborhood by propagating local information between neighboring particles while remaining effectively local. However, locality precludes modeling long-range effects critical to many real-world systems, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenge of efficiently modeling non-local interactions. This novel architecture generalizes the classical charge equilibration (Qeq) method to a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. Therefore, CELLI extends the capability of GNNs to model long-range interactions while providing high interpretability through explicitly modeled charges. On benchmark systems, CELLI achieves state-of-the-art results for strictly local models. CELLI generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures while providing high computational efficiency and robust predictions.

Abstract: Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of the large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive accuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of players one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets containing data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player value in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The resulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.

<title>Green LIME: Improving AI Explainability through Design of Experiments</title>

arXiv:2502.12753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI), the complexity of many models and processes surpasses human understanding, making it challenging to determine why a specific prediction is made. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in critical fields like healthcare, where trust in a model's predictions is paramount. As a result, the explainability of machine learning (ML) and other complex models has become a key area of focus. Efforts to improve model explainability often involve experimenting with AI systems and approximating their behavior through interpretable surrogate mechanisms. However, these procedures can be resource-intensive. Optimal design of experiments, which seeks to maximize the information obtained from a limited number of observations, offers promising methods for improving the efficiency of these explainability techniques. To demonstrate this potential, we explore Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), a widely used method introduced by Ribeiro et al. (2016). LIME provides explanations by generating new data points near the instance of interest and passing them through the model. While effective, this process can be computationally expensive, especially when predictions are costly or require many samples. LIME is highly versatile and can be applied to a wide range of models and datasets. In this work, we focus on models involving tabular data, regression tasks, and linear models as interpretable local approximations. By utilizing optimal design of experiments' techniques, we reduce the number of function evaluations of the complex model, thereby reducing the computational effort of LIME by a significant amount. We consider this modified version of LIME to be energy-efficient or "green".

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in document processing, robust text recognition has become increasingly critical for knowledge extraction. While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks, Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 sub-domains, encompassing diverse document types including handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types for business intelligence. Our findings show that modern vision-language models (such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen) outperform traditional OCR approaches (like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an average of 60% in Character Error Rate (CER). Furthermore, we highlight significant limitations of current Arabic OCR models, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where the best model Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only 65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges in accurately recognizing Arabic text, including issues with complex fonts, numeral recognition errors, word elongation, and table structure detection. This work establishes a rigorous evaluation framework that can drive improvements in Arabic document analysis methods and bridge the performance gap with English OCR technologies.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate charged current neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. We consider a simplified framework to generate muon kinematic variables, specifically its energy and scattering angle. GAN models are trained on simulation data from \nuwro{} Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The models work for neutrino energy ranging from 300 MeV to 10 GeV. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the distribution of muon kinematics.

<title>Learning Data-Driven Uncertainty Set Partitions for Robust and Adaptive Energy Forecasting with Missing Data</title>

Abstract: Short-term forecasting models typically assume the availability of input data (features) when they are deployed and in use. However, equipment failures, disruptions, cyberattacks, may lead to missing features when such models are used operationally, which could negatively affect forecast accuracy, and result in suboptimal operational decisions. In this paper, we use adaptive robust optimization and adversarial machine learning to develop forecasting models that seamlessly handle missing data operationally. We propose linear- and neural network-based forecasting models with parameters that adapt to available features, combining linear adaptation with a novel algorithm for learning data-driven uncertainty set partitions. The proposed adaptive models do not rely on identifying historical missing data patterns and are suitable for real-time operations under stringent time constraints. Extensive numerical experiments on short-term wind power forecasting considering horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead illustrate that our proposed adaptive models are on par with imputation when data are missing for very short periods (e.g., when only the latest measurement is missing) whereas they significantly outperform imputation when data are missing for longer periods. We further provide insights by showcasing how linear adaptation and data-driven partitions (even with a few subsets) approach the performance of the optimal, yet impractical, method of retraining for every possible realization of missing data.

<title>Nested Stochastic Algorithm for Generalized Sinkhorn distance-Regularized Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a powerful technique to train robust models against data distribution shift. This paper aims to solve regularized nonconvex DRO problems, where the uncertainty set is modeled by a so-called generalized Sinkhorn distance and the loss function is nonconvex and possibly unbounded. Such a distance allows to model uncertainty of distributions with different probability supports and divergence functions. For this class of regularized DRO problems, we derive a novel dual formulation taking the form of nested stochastic optimization, where the dual variable depends on the data sample. To solve the dual problem, we provide theoretical evidence to design a nested stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which leverages stochastic approximation to estimate the nested stochastic gradients. We study the convergence rate of nested SGD and establish polynomial iteration and sample complexities that are independent of the data size and parameter dimension, indicating its potential for solving large-scale DRO problems. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The increasing demands for high-throughput and energy-efficient wireless communications are driving the adoption of extremely large antennas operating at high-frequency bands. In these regimes, multiple users will reside in the radiative near-field, and accurate localization becomes essential. Unlike conventional far-field systems that rely solely on DOA estimation, near-field localization exploits spherical wavefront propagation to recover both DOA and range information. While subspace-based methods, such as MUSIC and its extensions, offer high resolution and interpretability for near-field localization, their performance is significantly impacted by model assumptions, including non-coherent sources, well-calibrated arrays, and a sufficient number of snapshots. To address these limitations, this work proposes AI-aided subspace methods for near-field localization that enhance robustness to real-world challenges. Specifically, we introduce NF-SubspaceNet, a deep learning-augmented 2D MUSIC algorithm that learns a surrogate covariance matrix to improve localization under challenging conditions, and DCD-MUSIC, a cascaded AI-aided approach that decouples angle and range estimation to reduce computational complexity. We further develop a novel model-order-aware training method to accurately estimate the number of sources, that is combined with casting of near field subspace methods as AI models for learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform classical and existing deep-learning-based localization techniques, providing robust near-field localization even under coherent sources, miscalibrations, and few snapshots.

Abstract: While the matrix completion problem has attracted considerable attention over the decades, few works address the nonignorable missing issue and all have their limitations. In this article, we propose a nuclear norm regularized row- and column-wise matrix U-statistic loss function for the generalized nonignorable missing mechanism, a flexible and generally applicable missing mechanism which contains both ignorable and nonignorable missing mechanism assumptions. The proposed method achieves computational efficiency comparable to the existing missing-at-random approaches, while providing the near minimax optimal statistical convergence rate guarantees for the more general nonignorable missing case. We propose an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to solve the associated optimization problem, and characterize the interaction between algorithmic and statistical convergence. Simulations and real data analyzes further support the practical utility of the proposed method.

Abstract: We are interested in the estimation of a rank-one tensor signal when only a portion $\varepsilon$ of its noisy observation is available. We show that the study of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose spectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results shed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial reduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of its entries.

Abstract: This study presents a novel mathematical model derived from cohomology, leveraging the KEEL-proven theorem that establishes cohomology as tautological, generated by boundary classes of curves with fixed dual graphs. Simplicial complexes are constructed using skew-commutative graded algebra, and the structure theorem is applied to connect distinct homologies, enabling precise interpretations of the resulting geometric forms. The proposed model is utilized for protein structure analysis and prediction, with a specific application to the Flagellar Motor structure.

<title>Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI</title>

arXiv:2504.18536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.

Abstract: Protecting cloud applications is critical in an era where security threats are increasingly sophisticated and persistent. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are particularly vulnerable, making innovative security approaches essential. This research explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Topic Modelling, to analyse security-related text data and anticipate potential threats. We focus on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to extract meaningful patterns from data sources, including logs, reports, and deployment traces. Using the Gensim framework in Python, these methods categorise log entries into security-relevant topics (e.g., phishing, encryption failures). The identified topics are leveraged to highlight patterns indicative of security issues across CI/CD's continuous stages (build, test, deploy). This approach introduces a semantic layer that supports early vulnerability recognition and contextual understanding of runtime behaviours.

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.

arXiv:2506.14473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-shot subset selection serves as an effective tool to reduce deep learning training costs by identifying an informative data subset based on the information extracted by an information extractor (IE). Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels. Motivated by these finding, we propose RAM-APL (RAnking Mean-Accuracy of Pseudo-class Labels), a method tailored for fine-grained image datasets. RAM-APL leverages multiple FMs to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces. This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. These human-agent collaboration systems enable humans and LLM-based agents to collaborate effectively by leveraging their complementary strengths. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities arising from human-AI collaboration. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities (vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal) reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558 communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

arXiv:2506.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders (GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease, where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms.

<div> Keywords: Context-Content Uncertainty Principle, operational principles, hierarchical layers, entropy minimization, brain and machine inference.

Summary:
The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) suggests that inference under uncertainty involves aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content. This paper introduces a layered computational framework based on CCUP, starting with entropy minimization to prioritize content structuring. The framework includes four hierarchical layers: Core Inference Constraints (structure-first, asymmetric flow, cycle-consistency, conditional compression), Resource Allocation Principles (precision-weighted attention, learning rates, memory encoding), Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics (learning organization over time), and Spatial Hierarchical Composition (integration of mechanisms). Formal theorems, dependency lattice, and computational simulations demonstrate the efficiency gains of CCUP-aligned inference. The brain is viewed as a cycle-consistent entropy resolver that aligns structure and specificity through content-driven simulation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered computational framework that derives operational principles from this foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression, all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates, and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula; and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

Summary:
Diffusion models are powerful tools in generative modeling, but adapting them to new objectives at inference time is challenging. Existing methods of guiding the model often provide inaccurate value estimates, especially in noisy conditions, leading to biased results. Additionally, past computations are not efficiently reused, leading to wasted compute resources. To address these issues, a new approach called Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) is introduced. By treating inference-time alignment as a search problem and reusing past computations in a tree-based approach, DTS produces accurate samples from the target distribution with significantly less compute. Its variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), is able to perform a global search for high reward samples efficiently. This innovative method allows for steady improvement in sample quality with additional compute resources, making it a scalable solution for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.

<div> manifold hypothesis; diffusion models; local intrinsic dimension; FLIPD; LID estimation

Summary:
This paper addresses the manifold hypothesis in high-dimensional data spaces and the use of diffusion models (DMs) for learning low-dimensional submanifolds. It focuses on the estimation of local intrinsic dimension (LID) using an estimator called FLIPD, which has various applications such as quantifying data complexity and detecting outliers. The paper proves the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions, bridging a theoretical gap left by previous work. Additionally, it explores the use of uniform convolutions as an alternative to Gaussian ones and demonstrates the relevance of this approach. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how DMs can effectively learn and estimate the intrinsic dimensions of data submanifolds, leading to improved performance in various applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification for tackling complex scientific problems.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction, interpretation and Q\&amp;A atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization; and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents. Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness.

<div> Keywords: LLM, relation extraction, fine-tuning, dynamic weight-grafting, attention mechanisms

Summary: 
- The study investigates how LLMs retain relation information learned during fine-tuning processes.
- Existing localization methods do not effectively capture this process, leading to the proposal of dynamic weight-grafting approach.
- The proposed method demonstrates that LLMs both extract and recall relation information during processing and prediction stages.
- Different pathways exist for correct generation of fine-tuned information, with some cases requiring multiple pathways.
- The study analyzes the necessity, sufficiency, and redundancy of these information pathways, identifying task-specific attention mechanisms and relation extraction in output layers as key components. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases, corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g. activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and (2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the ``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

<div> Keywords: language models, training, hardware accelerators, precision formats, instabilities

Summary: 
Training large language models is computationally expensive, prompting the development of lower-precision arithmetic formats like Microscaling (MX). However, when training in MX formats, sharp stochastic instabilities in loss are observed, especially at larger compute scales. These instabilities are attributed to multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of activations, leading to runaway divergence. Intervention experiments show that modifying precision schemes mid-training can avert or delay instabilities. Stabilization strategies in the large language model (LLM) setting, including certain hybrid configurations, can recover performance competitive with full-precision training. The research conducted sheds light on the challenges and viability of block-scaled precision formats during model training and offers insights into maintaining stability and performance in training language models using lower-precision arithmetic. <div>
arXiv:2506.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX) formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from $2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with full-precision training. We release our code at https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

The article introduces the Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) method as a more scalable and robust alternative to the Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD) for decomposing neural network parameters into simpler parts. The SPD method allows for decomposing larger and more complex models compared to APD, without issues like parameter shrinkage and better identification of ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By combining causal mediation analysis with network decomposition methods, this work paves the way for new research possibilities in mechanistic interpretability by addressing computational cost and hyperparameter sensitivity challenges. The authors provide a library for running SPD and replicating the experiments, showcasing its effectiveness in simplifying neural networks for ease of study and analysis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction. However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Hellsemble is a novel ensemble framework for binary classification that actively considers dataset complexity. It incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of difficulty and trains models on increasingly challenging subsets. A router model determines the most suitable base model for new instances based on inferred difficulty. This approach improves classification accuracy, maintains computational efficiency, and enhances interpretability. Experimental results on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks show that Hellsemble outperforms traditional ensemble methods. Embracing instance-level difficulty is identified as a promising direction for building efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance, but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel and efficient method for detecting adversarial examples in deep neural networks. While existing defense techniques focus on improving robustness or using a secondary model to detect attacks, this study emphasizes attack detection as a practical defense strategy. The proposed method analyzes the impact of attacks on different layers of a DNN by training a lightweight regression model to predict deeper-layer features from early-layer features, leveraging the prediction error to identify adversarial samples. The method is demonstrated to be highly effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, adaptable to any DNN architecture, and applicable across various domains including image, video, and audio. Through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments, the article showcases the superiority of the proposed approach in detecting adversarial input designs with limited noise budgets. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image, video, and audio.

Summary:<br />
- Graph neural networks are powerful for solving graph-related problems, but distributed frameworks often face performance degradation in link prediction due to graph partitioning and negative sampling.
- Information loss from graph partitioning and negative sampling methods contribute to performance degradation in distributed training of GNNs for link prediction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored. This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving link prediction accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of adaptive time allocation in integrated sensing and communication systems equipped with radar and communication units. The dual-functional radar-communication system's task involves allocating dwell times for tracking multiple targets and utilizing the remaining time for data transmission towards estimated target locations. We introduce a novel constrained deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) approach, designed to optimize resource allocation between tracking and communication under time budget constraints, thereby enhancing target communication quality. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed CDRL framework, confirming its ability to maximize communication quality in highly dynamic environments while adhering to time constraints.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple competing objectives in dynamic environments.

<div> Keywords: large language models, memorization, fine-tuning, LoRA, data extraction attacks

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to data extraction attacks due to memorization during training. The impact of memorization in fine-tuning, especially with LoRA, a parameter-efficient method, is less explored. This study reveals a divergence in the effects of memorization between different fine-tuning strategies. Factors like model scale and data duplication, which affect memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not show the same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a relaxed similarity-based metric, it is demonstrated that LoRA reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining strong task performance. This highlights the effectiveness of LoRA in mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong task performance.

<div> Keywords: output-reweighting unlearning, classifier, user deletion rights, biased predictions, membership inference attacks

Summary:<br />
In this work, the RWFT method is introduced as a lightweight technique for erasing a specific class from a trained classifier without the need for full retraining. This is important for enforcing user deletion rights and reducing biased predictions. Existing unlearning methods are costly and fail to accurately predict samples from the unlearned class. A new attack, MIA-NN, successfully reveals the unlearned class with these methods. RWFT proposes a redistribution of probability mass for predictions on samples from the forgotten class, which is robust to MIA-NN. A new metric based on total variation distance is introduced to quantify residual leakage and prevent susceptibility to attacks. Experimental results show that RWFT outperforms existing methods in both previously used metrics and the new TV-based metric, achieving a 2.79% improvement in the former and an impressive 111.45% improvement in the latter over the best existing method.<br /> <div>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV) distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45% in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that dynamically selects a subset of effective models from a preselected candidate set using feedback from a bipartite graph. This approach reduces computational complexity and results in smaller prediction sets. By incorporating prediction set size feedback alongside model loss, the algorithm efficiently constructs smaller prediction sets while still maintaining the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithm is proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the new method outperforms existing multi-model online conformal prediction approaches by constructing smaller prediction sets. <div>
arXiv:2506.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift, multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges. A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss, can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal prediction approaches.

<div> average-reward MDPs, offline reinforcement learning, distribution shift, non-uniform coverage, sample complexity bound<br />
<br />Summary:
This study focuses on offline reinforcement learning in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which poses challenges due to distribution shift and non-uniform coverage. The researchers develop guarantees based on the target policy, using measures like bias span and policy hitting radius, without relying on complex measures like uniform mixing time. They introduce a novel algorithm that combines pessimistic discounted value iteration with quantile clipping, allowing for sharper penalty functions. The algorithm does not require prior parameter knowledge. The study also addresses general weakly communicating MDPs, without imposing restrictive assumptions. Hard examples show that learning under their conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the target policy's stationary distribution. Lower bounds closely match the main results, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in offline reinforcement learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2506.20904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy, specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs, contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy, distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DL-LIME, a modified approach that combines deep learning with the LIME method for explainable AI. By addressing the limitations of conventional LIME, DL-LIME enhances both fidelity and task performance in deep reinforcement learning for radar resource management. The integration of DL-LIME provides valuable insights into the decision-making process and highlights critical factors in radar resource management. The study demonstrates the superior performance of DL-LIME compared to traditional LIME by incorporating correlations between features, thereby improving the interpretability of neural network-based decision-making models. <div>
arXiv:2506.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM). However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI) techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach to chemical process optimization using a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents. These agents autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, eliminating the need for predefined bounds. The framework, named AutoGen, employs specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional methods but with better computational efficiency, converging in under 20 minutes and achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. The reasoning-guided search showcased sophisticated process understanding by identifying utility trade-offs and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach has significant potential for optimization scenarios with poorly characterized constraints, especially for emerging processes and retrofit applications.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable, requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution, and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs, and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit applications.

<div> Keywords: symbolic rules, interpretable prediction models, logical propositions, sparse linear transformations, decision regions<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel approach to building interpretable prediction models using small additive ensembles of symbolic rules. These rules incorporate logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables, allowing for decision regions with oblique faces. By extending traditional rule ensembles in this way, the model complexity is significantly reduced while maintaining the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods. The learning method proposed in the article utilizes sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation of logistic regression. Experimental results on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in constructing rule ensembles with improved interpretability and accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2506.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables, i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where $\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across ten benchmark datasets.

The article discusses the challenge of problematic datapoints in large language models trained on web data and introduces the MSA algorithm for estimating and undoing the influence of specific datapoints. Existing unlearning algorithms have limitations in accurately removing problematic data without complete retraining. MSA leverages model checkpoints to estimate and eliminate data influence effectively. Experimental results show that MSA outperforms other machine unlearning algorithms in various benchmarks and models, indicating its potential for creating more flexible large language models capable of data erasure.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.20941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces. Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\% rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new approach called Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) for improving the fine-tuning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) without using backpropagation. SharpZO combines a sharpness-aware evolutionary strategy stage with a sparse zeroth-order optimization stage to enhance performance. The method globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to create a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search. This approach allows for optimization using only forward passes, making it suitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. Experimental results on CLIP models show that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, outperforming existing forward-only methods by up to 7%. <div>
arXiv:2506.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

<div> keywords: explicit density learners, generative models, normalizing flows, knowledge distillation, compositional normalizing flows 

Summary: 
Explicit density learners, such as normalizing flows, are gaining popularity in generative modeling for their ability to accurately model probability distributions and perform exact latent-variable inference. While they have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks, they can be challenging to train and may have lower sampling quality. In this study, novel knowledge distillation techniques are proposed to enhance the sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows. By distilling knowledge within intermediate layers, smaller student models can achieve significant performance improvements compared to non-distilled students. This approach allows for a more efficient use of resources, as smaller models can increase throughput proportionally based on the number of bijectors and parameters in the network. This research aims to explore the capacities and limitations of knowledge distillation in Compositional Normalizing Flows to better understand the benefits offered by these architectures. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for generative models because of their ability to better model probability distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows. We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation, we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

<div> Keywords: molecular property prediction, multimodal learning, TRIDENT, functional annotations, molecular representations

Summary:
TRIDENT is a novel framework for molecular property prediction that integrates molecular SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn rich molecular representations. The framework utilizes a volume-based alignment objective to align tri-modal features at the global level, allowing for soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities. Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a local alignment objective to capture detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their corresponding sub-textual descriptions. By dynamically balancing global and local alignment through a momentum-based mechanism, the model can learn both broad functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities. Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for molecular property prediction.

<div> Keywords: Continual learning, Mixture-of-Experts, LoRA, Interference, Redundancy <br />
Summary: 
MoRA is a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach designed to address the challenges faced by large pre-trained models in continual learning. It tackles interference by decomposing updates into rank-1 components, reducing redundancy and enabling fine-grained expert utilization. By allowing each rank-1 expert to infer its relevance and adaptively selecting a sparse mixture of ranks per input, MoRA prevents ambiguous routing and stabilizes expert assignments. The proposed rank pruning and activation budgets further enhance the model's performance in continual learning tasks with CLIP and large language models, improving generalization and mitigating forgetting. MoRA's innovative approach shows significant effectiveness in enhancing continual learning with pre-trained models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components, each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1 expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while mitigating forgetting.

Summary:<br />
This paper examines how federated learning (FL) performance is affected by concept drift, where real-world data streams with shifting distributions. By modeling concept drift as a Markov chain and introducing the Stationary Generalization Error, the paper assesses a model's ability to capture characteristics of future unseen data. Three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, random) and their impact on FL performance are studied, with an algorithm proposed to mitigate performance degradation by regularizing empirical risk minimization with KL divergence and mutual information. The method shows consistent improvement over existing approaches for the drift patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to concept drift in FL. Experimental results on a Raspberry Pi4 FL testbed validate the approach, confirming the significant impact of drift patterns on performance and the successful mitigation of performance degradation through the proposed algorithm.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting concept drift in FL.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a hierarchical RL framework designed to address challenges in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks with sparse rewards. SSE enforces single-step subgoal reachability, improving decision-making efficiency. It employs a decoupled exploration policy to explore uncharted goal spaces systematically. Additionally, SSE incorporates a failure-aware path refinement mechanism that adjusts edge costs based on observed success rates, enhancing subgoal reliability. Experimental results showcase SSE's superior performance over existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL approaches in success rates and efficiency across diverse benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions, they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability. Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

Summary:

- Existing methods focus on exploration and diversity but lack efficiency, especially in high-dimensional situations.
- This work proposes a min-max game approach for skill discovery, incorporating regret-awareness and policy learning.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15% zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing methods.

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces the concept of concept drift in federated learning, highlighting real, virtual, and label drift sources.

<br /><br />Summary: FedDAA is a dynamic clustered FL framework addressing multi-source concept drift by detecting real drift and preserving historical knowledge. By integrating modules for cluster number determination and concept drift adaptation, FedDAA outperforms existing methods on various datasets, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements. <div>
arXiv:2506.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift (a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However, effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems, particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space, CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2 layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models, making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Summary:
FeDa4Fair is introduced as a tool for evaluating fair Federated Learning (FL) methods in the presence of biased data distributions among clients. This tool aims to address the challenge of ensuring fairness in FL models, considering the diverse and conflicting fairness needs of different clients. The paper contributes by providing a library for generating tabular datasets, releasing four bias-heterogeneous datasets for benchmarking fairness mitigation methods, and offering functions for evaluating fairness outcomes. By enabling consistent benchmarking at both global and client levels, this research supports robust and reproducible fairness interventions in FL. The focus is on enhancing fairness for multiple sensitive attributes, rather than just binary ones, to ensure fair outcomes for all clients involved. <div>
arXiv:2506.21095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways: (1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Summary:
The paper introduces Hierarchical Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new Concept-Based Model (CBM) that provides interpretability for both concept and task predictions. Unlike existing CBMs, H-CMR models relationships between concepts using a learned directed acyclic graph with logic rules defining concepts. It employs a neural attention mechanism to select and apply rules hierarchically for predicting concepts and tasks. Experimental results show that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while allowing for human interaction through concept and model interventions. Interventions can improve accuracy at inference time and enhance data efficiency during training with additional background knowledge. Overall, H-CMR enhances interpretability in deep learning models and offers a promising approach for explaining predictions through high-level concepts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task. However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is available.

Summary:
Conditional computation is a popular strategy to enhance the efficiency of Transformers. In this study, a novel architecture is proposed that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle outward. A learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input. A gated attention mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions. Residual norms are controlled using a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme, while gate sparsity is managed with adaptive regularization loss. The goal was to reduce compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and foster an emergent multi-level representational hierarchy. However, the approach did not yield improvements in the trade-off between validation cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer layers. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Proposal of a novel Transformer architecture for dynamic skipping of layers based on input

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g., mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another. However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions. Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

<div> Keywords: single-cell responses, gene regulatory network, data augmentation, perturbation signals, evaluation metric

Summary: 
The study introduces a framework called Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to address the challenge of unpaired single-cell response data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. The framework utilizes gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals biologically and improve data generation quality through a masking mechanism that predicts silent genes. The study emphasizes the intrinsic heterogeneity in gene expression responses to perturbations, introducing a bimodal evaluation metric to better capture this variability. The proposed Unlasting model integrates dual conditional diffusion models to enhance insights into perturbations and improve data generation quality. Overall, the framework offers a novel approach to modeling single-cell responses across various perturbations by leveraging GRN information, addressing unpaired data challenges, and accurately capturing the heterogeneity in gene expression responses. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces an antifragile reinforcement learning framework for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance adaptability to adversarial attacks. The framework incorporates a switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS) to dynamically select among multiple robust policies to minimize distributional shifts in state-action-value distributions induced by attacks. By deriving a diverse ensemble of action robust policies and modeling them as a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, the framework effectively adapts to evolving adversarial strategies.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift, results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust, non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

<br />
Summary: 
This article presents a new approach to addressing vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning policies deployed in safety-critical systems, particularly in UAV navigation. The proposed antifragile RL framework is designed to adapt against incremental adversarial attacks in the observation space. The framework introduces a simulated attacker that incrementally increases the strength of perturbations in the observation space, allowing the RL agent to generalize across a wider range of out-of-distribution observations and anticipate unseen attacks. The article includes a theoretical characterization of fragility and antifragility, defining catastrophic forgetting and adaptation conditions. The method enforces bounds on value shifts through expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization. Empirical evaluation in a UAV deconfliction scenario shows that the antifragile policy outperforms standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to adversarial attacks, achieving higher cumulative reward and fewer conflict events. This demonstrates the practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for secure decision-making in evolving threat environments.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat scenarios.

<div> Query Norm, Linear Attention, Entropy Reduction, Norm-Aware, Kernel Function

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel Norm-Aware Linear Attention (NaLaFormer) mechanism to address challenges in linear attention mechanisms. By decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction components, NaLaFormer controls norm-aware spikiness and ensures norm consistency. It incorporates a query-norm aware kernel function to dynamically control entropy reduction based on query norms. A norm-preserving mapping is utilized to enforce non-negativity constraints and maintain norm distributions. Experimental results show that NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2%. The proposed mechanism effectively restores norm-guided dynamic spikiness and kernel-perturbed norm distributions. It highlights the importance of query norms in softmax normalization for entropy reduction and introduces a cosine similarity-based method to inhibit dimensions with opposite directions. NaLaFormer presents a promising approach to improving the effectiveness of linear attention mechanisms in various applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction, current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$ normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI) datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

<div> Keywords: UAVs, intrusion detection systems, adversarial attacks, generative adversarial network, cyber threats

Summary:
The paper presents a framework for detecting stealthy adversarial attacks on UAVs by utilizing conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to create attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems. These attacks are designed to appear benign while maintaining statistical similarities to out-of-distribution data. A multi-class IDS classifier is trained on various known cyber-attacks to identify these adversarial samples. A conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is implemented to differentiate between authentic out-of-distribution samples and adversarial inputs, outperforming traditional detection methods. The study highlights the importance of advanced probabilistic models in enhancing intrusion detection systems' resilience against adaptive cyber threats.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples; however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate. Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI), man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Summary: 
pFedDC is a personalized federated learning framework that integrates dual-prompt learning and cross fusion to address heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Clients in the federation maintain global and local prompts for both vision and language modalities. Global prompts capture shared knowledge, while local prompts capture client-specific semantics.

Extensive experiments on nine datasets demonstrate pFedDC's superiority over current methods in handling federated learning challenges.

arXiv:2506.21144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC. Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: 
Linearity-based compression is proposed as a new method to reduce weights in neural networks by exploiting the linearity of neurons with ReLU-like activation functions. The approach allows for merging subsequent layers, resulting in a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in most tested models. The method can be successfully combined with existing importance-based pruning techniques, showing little interference between different types of compression. This work introduces a novel method that lays the foundation for more efficient and smaller neural network models. <div>
arXiv:2506.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally. Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural network models.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations, in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment (i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps. Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information, assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates, preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness, Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using $62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and data to facilitate further research in this direction.

Applied to two real-world datasets, the method demonstrates effective risk prediction.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects. Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100 billion parameters.

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM (Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of analytical approaches.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work, we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average, improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving near-perfect load balancing.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems, existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and 2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability to independently process recent information or leverage contextual enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology, physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle, is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools, including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound: after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis. It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias, i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.

Abstract: rQdia regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images in pixel-based deep reinforcement learning. With a simple auxiliary loss, that equalizes these distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and Data-Efficient Rainbow on 18/26 Atari Arcade environments. Gains are measured in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state encoding baseline.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

<title>Temporal-Aware Graph Attention Network for Cryptocurrency Transaction Fraud Detection</title>

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular in-context learning.

<title>Scalable Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference</title>

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base parameters as prior work.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75% reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to 1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate, one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline, offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential decision-making.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically, Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics, serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer pruning strategy.

<title>Optimising 4th-Order Runge-Kutta Methods: A Dynamic Heuristic Approach for Efficiency and Low Storage</title>

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling. However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems, including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3 percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets, underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.

<title>Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion, providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining, enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model complexity and improve the generalization bound.

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels. Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is possible and effective.

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R. Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339, accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas. Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to provide a complete answer to the original question.

<title>Utility-Driven Speculative Decoding for Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel, boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token, greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights, increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x, making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model, and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality, enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math, extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding practical for MoEs.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines, which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to 1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of modern protein folding models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.

Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells. Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words (tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional, sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods. Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological discovery.

Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators. To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions for a corresponding approximated control problem.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and (2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high dimensions.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data, propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate, and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification, and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks, a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for different nonlinear structural systems.

<title>The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should also result in better research after being executed. To test whether AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas, either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100 hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas in the absence of execution outcomes.

Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US, Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables, providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in improving hydrological modeling and understanding.

Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model, trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.

Abstract: Data-driven agriculture, which integrates technology and data into agricultural practices, has the potential to improve crop yield, disease resilience, and long-term soil health. However, privacy concerns, such as adverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from sharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we propose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and collaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian noise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows researchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train personalized machine learning models either on the data of identified collaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated privacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential collaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life datasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks and utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how this framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers pursue broader research objectives. The adoption of the framework can empower researchers and policymakers to leverage agricultural data responsibly, paving the way for transformative advances in data-driven agriculture. By addressing critical privacy challenges, this work supports secure data integration, fostering innovation and sustainability in agricultural systems.

<title>Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance</title>

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a. multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of potential independent interest, including novel connections between average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations of VI approaches.

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains, ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance. It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process (incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments, ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made. The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior, Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed. Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random directed cyclic graphs.

Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD) competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP), which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT, showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus. However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and adaptability. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/EverM0re/EraRAG-Official.

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be surprisingly expressive.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows, aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively. Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task, conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10 times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware noise.

<title>Improving Diffusion-Based Image Editing Faithfulness via Guidance and Scheduling</title>

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved. However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable, deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation of the framework is available at\,: https://github.com/yannKerzreho/MarkovGameApproximation

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable. Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens, EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%, and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However, most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking, CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks: reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer, we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical challenges in therapeutic development.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1) accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/xulsh8/FlickCD.

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore, estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus, these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model. Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric. Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7% compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

<title>Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?</title>

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis, methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal. Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&amp;A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024, whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of data source diversity on the performance of cryptocurrency forecasting models by integrating various data categories, including technical indicators, on-chain metrics, sentiment and interest metrics, traditional market indices, and macroeconomic indicators. We introduce the Crypto100 index, representing the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and propose a novel feature reduction algorithm to identify the most impactful and resilient features from diverse data sources. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that data source diversity significantly enhances the predictive performance of forecasting models across different time horizons. Key findings include the paramount importance of on-chain metrics for both short-term and long-term predictions, the growing relevance of traditional market indices and macroeconomic indicators for longer-term forecasts, and substantial improvements in model accuracy when diverse data sources are utilized. These insights help demystify the short-term and long-term driving factors of the cryptocurrency market and lay the groundwork for developing more accurate and resilient forecasting models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.21278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables, better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent space utilization while offering a more expressive representation. Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF, which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions. Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training. The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series, eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge. Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

<title>Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size, are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres: Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze computational resource requirements across different adapter scales, demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher redundancy in their generations.

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast, polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem \cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation, consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand, leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real-world data.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for future research in this critical safety application.

Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions, with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than 150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue systems.

This work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition, four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static, dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4 hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However, these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics. Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of performance.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce skLEP, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating Slovak natural language understanding (NLU) models. We have compiled skLEP to encompass nine diverse tasks that span token-level, sentence-pair, and document-level challenges, thereby offering a thorough assessment of model capabilities. To create this benchmark, we curated new, original datasets tailored for Slovak and meticulously translated established English NLU resources. Within this paper, we also present the first systematic and extensive evaluation of a wide array of Slovak-specific, multilingual, and English pre-trained language models using the skLEP tasks. Finally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit facilitating both fine-tuning and evaluation of models, and a public leaderboard at https://github.com/slovak-nlp/sklep in the hopes of fostering reproducibility and drive future research in Slovak NLU.

Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity, and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample, but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise, these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k without relying on external data.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with video prediction from the perspective of a human.

Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving robustness, privacy, and efficiency simultaneously in machine learning systems is infeasible under prevailing threat models. The tension between these goals arises not from algorithmic shortcomings but from structural limitations imposed by worst-case adversarial assumptions. We advocate for a systematic research agenda aimed at formalizing the robustness-privacy-efficiency trilemma, exploring how principled relaxations of threat models can unlock better trade-offs, and designing benchmarks that expose rather than obscure the compromises made. By shifting focus from aspirational universal guarantees to context-aware system design, the machine learning community can build models that are truly appropriate for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens, such as words, the task of next-token prediction is to predict the next-token conditional probability distribution. Decoder-only transformers have become effective models for this task, but their properties are still not fully understood. In particular, the largest number of distinct context sequences that a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token distributions for has not been established. To fill this gap, we prove upper and lower bounds on this number, which are equal up to a multiplicative constant. We prove these bounds in the general setting where next-token distributions can be arbitrary as well as the empirical setting where they are calculated from a finite number of document sequences. Our lower bounds are for one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and our proofs highlight an important injectivity property satisfied by self-attention. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the minimal number of parameters for memorization is sufficient for being able to train the model to the entropy lower bound.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the online saddle point problem, which involves a sequence of two-player time-varying convex-concave games. Considering the nonstationarity of the environment, we adopt the duality gap and the dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as performance metrics for algorithm design. We present three variants of the proximal point method: the Online Proximal Point Method (OPPM), the Optimistic OPPM (OptOPPM), and the OptOPPM with multiple predictors. Each algorithm guarantees upper bounds for both the duality gap and dynamic Nash equilibrium regret, achieving near-optimality when measured against the duality gap. Specifically, in certain benign environments, such as sequences of stationary payoff functions, these algorithms maintain a nearly constant metric bound. Experimental results further validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. Lastly, this paper discusses potential reliability concerns associated with using dynamic Nash equilibrium regret as a performance metric. The technical appendix and code can be found at https://github.com/qingxin6174/PPM-for-OSP.

Abstract: Target-group detection is the task of detecting which group(s) a social media post is ``directed at or about'', with various applications, such as targeted-marketing. In this work, we focus on the fairness implications of target-group detection in the context of toxicity detection, where the perceived harm of a post often depends on which group(s) it targets. Because toxicity is highly contextual, language that appears benign in general may be harmful when targeting specific demographic groups. It is thus important to first detect which group(s) are being {\em targeted} by a post as a precursor to the subsequent task of determining whether the post is toxic given the group(s). Target-group detection is also challenging: a single post may simultaneously target one to many groups, and we must detect groups fairly in order to promote equitable treatment. We show that our proposed approach to {\em fairness-aware multi target-group detection} not only reduces bias across groups, but also achieves competitive predictive performance, outperforming existing fairness-aware baselines. To spur future research on fairness-aware target-group detection and support competitive benchmarking, we also share our code.

Abstract: In the last years, many learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, models operating on Euclidean coordinates are ill-suited for non-Euclidean, asymmetric problem instances that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based solvers.

Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network for the application of gyroscope calibration. We explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 186.6 hours of gyroscope readings, using 36 gyroscopes of four different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The six datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes. Our dataset is publicly available to allow reproducibility of our work and to increase research in the field.

Abstract: Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of individual training samples to a specific target. Yet, their high computational costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets. Existing methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly reduced the computational overheads. However, they mostly suffer from inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the algorithm. The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs on large-scale models. We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm. To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models. We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of HyperINF compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. We further validate the efficacy of HyperINF through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning. On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other baselines suffer from significant degradation. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/Blackzxy/HyperINF.

Abstract: Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a growing interest in tackling tasks requiring more global reasoning, where local features do not provide significant information. Minsky and Papert put forward such tasks in 1969 with their connectivity study, exposing the limitations of the perceptron model. In this paper, we introduce an expanded set of global visual datasets involving graphs, strings, mazes, and image grids. We show that large vision models still struggle to learn these tasks efficiently. Similarly, state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs perform poorly on these datasets. We explain this learning inefficiency by means of the 'globality degree' measure. To mitigate this, we propose a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS). Similar to the chain-of-thought and scratchpad techniques used in language models, CoS breaks the original task into intermediate visual steps to help learn a complex task. In addition, we show that not all CoS strategies perform equally well. Our key insight is to impose a Markovian structure on the CoS frames. This leads to the introduction of 'inductive CoS' which achieves better out-of-distribution generalization and performs well even with smaller models compared to non-inductive variants.

Abstract: Operator learning, the approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using machine learning, has gained increasing research attention in recent years. Approximate operators, learned from data, can serve as efficient surrogate models for problems in computational science and engineering, complementing traditional methods. However, despite their empirical success, our understanding of the underlying mathematical theory is in large part still incomplete. In this paper, we study the approximation of Lipschitz operators with respect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity of Lipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds on the Hermite polynomial approximation error. We then study general reconstruction strategies of Lipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary (potentially adaptive) linear samples. As a key finding, we tightly characterize the corresponding sample complexity, that is, the smallest achievable worst-case error among all possible choices of (adaptive) sampling and reconstruction strategies in terms of $m$. As a consequence, we identify an inherent curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitz operators based on $m$ linear samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates in $m$. On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay of the covariance operator of the underlying Gaussian measure guarantees convergence rates which are arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate. Overall, by tightly characterizing the sample complexity, our work confirms the intrinsic difficulty of learning Lipschitz operators, regardless of the data or learning technique.

Abstract: Record matching is the task of identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity across datasets. While most existing models optimize for accuracy, fairness has become an important concern due to the potential for unequal outcomes across demographic groups. Prior work typically focuses on binary outcomes evaluated at fixed decision thresholds. However, such evaluations can miss biases in matching scores--biases that persist across thresholds and affect downstream tasks. We propose a threshold-independent framework for measuring and reducing score bias, defined as disparities in the distribution of matching scores across groups. We show that several state-of-the-art matching methods exhibit substantial score bias, even when appearing fair under standard threshold-based metrics. To address this, we introduce two post-processing score calibration algorithms. The first, calib, aligns group-wise score distributions using the Wasserstein barycenter, targeting demographic parity. The second, ccalib, conditions on predicted labels to further reduce label-dependent biases, such as equal opportunity. Both methods are model-agnostic and require no access to model training data. calib also offers theoretical guarantees, ensuring reduced bias with minimal deviation from original scores. Experiments across real-world datasets and matching models confirm that calib and ccalib substantially reduce score bias while minimally impacting model accuracy.

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.

Abstract: Simulating and controlling physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial tasks across science and engineering. Recently, diffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for these tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model high-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with handling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions. In this work, we propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO), a novel PDE simulation and control framework that enhances the handling of these complexities. WDNO comprises two key innovations. Firstly, WDNO performs diffusion-based generative modeling in the wavelet domain for the entire trajectory to handle abrupt changes and long-term dependencies effectively. Secondly, to address the issue of poor generalization across different resolutions, which is one of the fundamental tasks in modeling physical systems, we introduce multi-resolution training. We validate WDNO on five physical systems, including 1D advection equation, three challenging physical systems with abrupt changes (1D Burgers' equation, 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equation and 2D incompressible fluid), and a real-world dataset ERA5, which demonstrates superior performance on both simulation and control tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in long-term and detail prediction accuracy. Remarkably, in the challenging context of the 2D high-dimensional and indirect control task aimed at reducing smoke leakage, WDNO reduces the leakage by 78% compared to the second-best baseline.

<title>Moderating the Generalization of Score-based Generative Model</title>

Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities, e.g. generating unseen, but natural data. However, the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard' does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness. Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.

Abstract: We study conditions under which transformers using soft attention can simulate hard attention, that is, effectively focus all attention on a subset of positions. First, we examine several subclasses of languages recognized by hard-attention transformers, which can be defined in variants of linear temporal logic. We demonstrate how soft-attention transformers can compute formulas of these logics using unbounded positional embeddings or temperature scaling. Second, we demonstrate how temperature scaling allows softmax transformers to simulate general hard-attention transformers, using a temperature that depends on the minimum gap between the maximum attention scores and other attention scores.

<title>On the Ability of Deep Networks to Learn Symmetries from Data: A Neural Kernel Theory</title>

Abstract: Symmetries (transformations by group actions) are present in many datasets, and leveraging them holds considerable promise for improving predictions in machine learning. In this work, we aim to understand when and how deep networks -- with standard architectures trained in a standard, supervised way -- learn symmetries from data. Inspired by real-world scenarios, we study a classification paradigm where data symmetries are only partially observed during training: some classes include all transformations of a cyclic group, while others -- only a subset. In the infinite-width limit, where kernel analogies apply, we derive a neural kernel theory of symmetry learning. The group-cyclic nature of the dataset allows us to analyze the Gram matrix of neural kernels in the Fourier domain; here we find a simple characterization of the generalization error as a function of class separation (signal) and class-orbit density (noise). This characterization reveals that generalization can only be successful when the local structure of the data prevails over its non-local, symmetry-induced structure, in the kernel space defined by the architecture. We extend our theoretical treatment to any finite group, including non-abelian groups. Our framework also applies to equivariant architectures (e.g., CNNs), and recovers their success in the special case where the architecture matches the inherent symmetry of the data. Empirically, our theory reproduces the generalization failure of finite-width networks (MLP, CNN, ViT) trained on partially observed versions of rotated-MNIST. We conclude that conventional deep networks lack a mechanism to learn symmetries that have not been explicitly embedded in their architecture a priori. Our framework could be extended to guide the design of architectures and training procedures able to learn symmetries from data.

<title>Lagrangian Index Policy for Restless Bandits with Average Reward</title>

Abstract: We study the Lagrange Index Policy (LIP) for restless multi-armed bandits with long-run average reward. In particular, we compare the performance of LIP with the performance of the Whittle Index Policy (WIP), both heuristic policies known to be asymptotically optimal under certain natural conditions. Even though in most cases their performances are very similar, in the cases when WIP shows bad performance, LIP continues to perform very well. We then propose reinforcement learning algorithms, both tabular and NN-based, to obtain online learning schemes for LIP in the model-free setting. The proposed reinforcement learning schemes for LIP require significantly less memory than the analogous schemes for WIP. We calculate analytically the Lagrange index for the restart model, which applies to the optimal web crawling and the minimization of the weighted age of information. We also give a new proof of asymptotic optimality in case of homogeneous arms as the number of arms goes to infinity, based on exchangeability and de Finetti's theorem.

Abstract: Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in AI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, Expectation Maximization (EM), and MICE, struggle to model the complex temporal and contextual dependencies in EHR data, particularly in underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked autoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the imputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured encoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their corresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies. Empirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, EM, and MICE across multiple metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably, Lab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients, advancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of follow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's robustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest that our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of EHR data, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation. In addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the a XGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting in power systems often involves multi-entity datasets like households, feeders, and wind turbines, where generating reliable entity-specific forecasts presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches require training individual models for each entity, making them inefficient and hard to scale. This study addresses this problem using GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder that allows entity-specific probabilistic forecasting using a single model. GUIDE-VAE provides flexible outputs, ranging from interpretable point estimates to full probability distributions, thanks to its advanced covariance composition structure. These distributions capture uncertainty and temporal dependencies, offering richer insights than traditional methods. To evaluate our GUIDE-VAE-based forecaster, we use household electricity consumption data as a case study due to its multi-entity and highly stochastic nature. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE-VAE outperforms conventional quantile regression techniques across key metrics while ensuring scalability and versatility. These features make GUIDE-VAE a powerful and generalizable tool for probabilistic forecasting tasks, with potential applications beyond household electricity consumption.

Abstract: We consider the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, where an unknown reward function of some Markov decision process is estimated based on observed expert demonstrations. In most existing approaches, IRL is formulated and solved as a nonconvex optimization problem, posing challenges in scenarios where robustness and reproducibility are critical. We discuss a convex formulation of the IRL problem (CIRL) initially proposed by Ng and Russel, and reformulate the problem such that the domain-specific language CVXPY can be applied directly to specify and solve the convex problem. We also extend the CIRL problem to scenarios where the expert policy is not given analytically but by trajectory as state-action pairs, which can be strongly inconsistent with optimality, by augmenting some of the constraints. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation for hyperparameter auto-selection are introduced. This note helps the users to easily apply CIRL for their problems, without background knowledge on convex optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes Genetic Algorithm with Border Trades (GAB), a novel modification of the standard genetic algorithm that enhances exploration by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process. This approach significantly mitigates premature convergence and improves search diversity. Empirically, GAB achieves up to 8x higher fitness and 10x faster convergence on complex job scheduling problems compared to standard Genetic Algorithms, reaching average fitness scores of 888 versus 106 in under 20 seconds. On the classic Flip-Flop problem, GAB consistently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions in fewer generations, even as input sizes scale to thousands of bits. These results highlight GAB as a highly effective and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs) construct tractable posterior approximations to GP models. At the core of these methods is the assumption that the true posterior distribution over training function values ${\bf f}$ and inducing variables ${\bf u}$ is approximated by a variational distribution that incorporates the conditional GP prior $p({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ in its factorization. While this assumption is considered as fundamental, we show that for model training we can relax it through the use of a more general variational distribution $q({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ that depends on $N$ extra parameters, where $N$ is the number of training examples. In GP regression, we can analytically optimize the evidence lower bound over the extra parameters and express a tractable collapsed bound that is tighter than the previous bound. The new bound is also amenable to stochastic optimization and its implementation requires minor modifications to existing sparse GP code. Further, we also describe extensions to non-Gaussian likelihoods. On several datasets we demonstrate that our method can reduce bias when learning the hyperparameters and can lead to better predictive performance.

<title>Mixture of Experts-augmented Deep Unfolding for Activity Detection in IRS-aided Systems</title>

Abstract: In the realm of activity detection for massive machine-type communications, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have shown significant potential in enhancing coverage for devices lacking direct connections to the base station (BS). However, traditional activity detection methods are typically designed for a single type of channel model, which does not reflect the complexities of real-world scenarios, particularly in systems incorporating IRS. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines model-driven deep unfolding with a mixture of experts (MoE) framework. By automatically selecting one of three expert designs and applying it to the unfolded projected gradient method, our approach eliminates the need for prior knowledge of channel types between devices and the BS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MoE-augmented deep unfolding method surpasses the traditional covariance-based method and black-box neural network design, delivering superior detection performance under mixed channel fading conditions.

<title>Discovering Global False Negatives On the Fly for Self-supervised Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: In self-supervised contrastive learning, negative pairs are typically constructed using an anchor image and a sample drawn from the entire dataset, excluding the anchor. However, this approach can result in the creation of negative pairs with similar semantics, referred to as "false negatives", leading to their embeddings being falsely pushed apart. To address this issue, we introduce GloFND, an optimization-based approach that automatically learns on the fly the threshold for each anchor data to identify its false negatives during training. In contrast to previous methods for false negative discovery, our approach globally detects false negatives across the entire dataset rather than locally within the mini-batch. Moreover, its per-iteration computation cost remains independent of the dataset size. Experimental results on image and image-text data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/vibalcam/GloFND.

<title>Seal Your Backdoor with Variational Defense</title>

Abstract: We propose VIBE, a model-agnostic framework that trains classifiers resilient to backdoor attacks. The key concept behind our approach is to treat malicious inputs and corrupted labels from the training dataset as observed random variables, while the actual clean labels are latent. VIBE then recovers the corresponding latent clean label posterior through variational inference. The resulting training procedure follows the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step infers the clean pseudolabels by solving an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, while the M-step updates the classifier parameters via gradient descent. Being modular, VIBE can seamlessly integrate with recent advancements in self-supervised representation learning, which enhance its ability to resist backdoor attacks. We experimentally validate the method effectiveness against contemporary backdoor attacks on standard datasets, a large-scale setup with 1$k$ classes, and a dataset poisoned with multiple attacks. VIBE consistently outperforms previous defenses across all tested scenarios.

<title>Revealing higher-order neural representations of uncertainty with the Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model</title>

Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.

<title>Capacity-Constrained Online Learning with Delays: Scheduling Frameworks and Regret Trade-offs</title>

arXiv:2503.19856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study online learning with oblivious losses and delays under a novel ``capacity constraint'' that limits how many past rounds can be tracked simultaneously for delayed feedback. Under ``clairvoyance'' (i.e., delay durations are revealed upfront each round) and/or ``preemptibility'' (i.e., we can stop tracking previously chosen round feedback), we establish matching upper and lower bounds (up to logarithmic terms) on achievable regret, characterizing the ``optimal capacity'' needed to match the minimax rates of classical delayed online learning, which implicitly assume unlimited capacity. Our algorithms achieve minimax-optimal regret across all capacity levels, with performance gracefully degrading under suboptimal capacity. For $K$ actions and total delay $D$ over $T$ rounds, under clairvoyance and assuming capacity $C = \Omega(\log(T))$, we achieve regret $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{TK + DK/C + D\log(K)})$ for bandits and $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{(D+T)\log(K)})$ for full-information feedback. When replacing clairvoyance with preemptibility, we require a known maximum delay bound $d_{\max}$, adding ${\widetilde{O}(d_{\max})}$ to the regret. For fixed delays $d$ (i.e., $D=Td$), the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{TK(1+d/C)+Td\log(K)})$ and the optimal capacity is $\Theta(\min\{K/\log(K),d\})$ in the bandit setting, while in the full-information feedback setting, the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{T(d+1)\log(K)})$ and the optimal capacity is $\Theta(1)$. For round-dependent and fixed delays, our upper bounds are achieved using novel preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling policies, based on Pareto-distributed proxy delays, and batching techniques, respectively. Crucially, our work unifies delayed bandits, label-efficient learning, and online scheduling frameworks, demonstrating that robust online learning under delayed feedback is possible with surprisingly modest tracking capacity.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained foundation models for diverse downstream tasks is a core practice in artificial intelligence. However, the wide range of tasks and high computational costs make full fine-tuning impractical. To overcome this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have emerged and are becoming a growing research focus. Despite the success of these methods, they are primarily designed for linear layers, focusing on two-dimensional matrices while largely ignoring higher-dimensional parameter spaces like convolutional kernels. Moreover, directly applying these methods to higher-dimensional parameter spaces often disrupts their structural relationships. Given the rapid advancements in matrix-based PEFT methods, rather than designing a specialized strategy, we propose a generalization that extends matrix-based PEFT methods to higher-dimensional parameter spaces without compromising their structural properties. Specifically, we treat parameters as elements of a Lie group, with updates modeled as perturbations in the corresponding Lie algebra. These perturbations are mapped back to the Lie group through the exponential map, ensuring smooth, consistent updates that preserve the inherent structure of the parameter space. Extensive experiments on computer vision and natural language processing validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, demonstrating clear improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a framework which generalizes "decision making with structured observations" by allowing robust (i.e. multivalued) models. In this framework, each model associates each decision with a convex set of probability distributions over outcomes. Nature can choose distributions out of this set in an arbitrary (adversarial) manner, that can be nonoblivious and depend on past history. The resulting framework offers much greater generality than classical bandits and reinforcement learning, since the realizability assumption becomes much weaker and more realistic. We then derive a theory of regret bounds for this framework. Although our lower and upper bounds are not tight, they are sufficient to fully characterize power-law learnability. We demonstrate this theory in two special cases: robust linear bandits and tabular robust online reinforcement learning. In both cases, we derive regret bounds that improve state-of-the-art (except that we do not address computational efficiency).

Abstract: The most widely used generative models map noise and data distributions by matching flows or scores. However, they struggle to incorporate partial observations and additional priors--something energy-based models (EBMs) handle elegantly by simply adding corresponding scalar energy terms. We address this issue by proposing Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the method's flexibility to introduce an interaction energy that supports diverse mode exploration, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein-generation setting. Our approach focuses on learning a scalar potential energy--without time-conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks--which marks a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe that this simplified framework significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling across diverse domains.
